<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> </b>I
dropped a bombshell end of last class telling you that all the geometric optics
I taught you has to be revised, and before letting you go for lunch I said
you've got to tell me why I would do that.</p>
<p><b><b>Student:</b></b> Experiments.</p>
<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b></b>
Yes, somebody said it's the experiments, and that's what I want you to
remember. That's the only way things change in physics is experiments tell you
something's wrong with your theory, and in the end if your theory doesn't agree
with the experiment it's over. And conversely, if you're a newcomer unknown to
anybody, make predictions and they agree with experiment then you're a rock
star. Everything is based on experiment. That's the only way we change our
mind. Now you might say, &quot;Why do you keep doing this to us? We believe
you. We write everything down. We do the problems and then you say, 'Oh,
these guys are wrong. Here's a better theory,' what's going on? Are people
really wrong?&quot; So I have to be very careful when I say people are wrong
because the news leaks to the press and the media will say, &quot;Physicists
think they're always wrong.&quot; </p>
<p>In fact, I've gone on
record here saying, &quot;We're always wrong.&quot; What I mean by that is no
matter how many laws we find one day you will find some new experiments which
are not explained by these laws. That's not really bad news. That's what
keeps us in business because we want to find something that doesn't fit
anything we know. For example, Newtonian mechanics in some sense is wrong
because it doesn't work when velocities approach the speed of light, but it's
not wrong in the sense that the predictions it made in its proper domain do not
work anymore. It was supposed to work in a limited range of experimental
observations. If you push the limit, if you build accelerators that send
particles at very high speeds you may find they don't obey Newtonian
mechanics. Then you get Einstein's special theory. Now if you have a special
theory like Einstein, or a new theory that overthrows the old theory, and it
explains new phenomena, there is still one extra requirement. Can you guess
what that might be with a new theory? One thing we demand of every new theory,
yes?</p>
<p><b><b>Student:</b></b> That part of it
coincides with the old theory?</p>
<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b></b>
Very good. If you go back to the old experiments, which are explained by the
old theory, well your new theory should continue to explain that. In fact the
new theory, when it's a good one, will tell you why for hundreds of years
people fell for the old theory and then it'll also do new stuff. If you do new
stuff and it doesn't fit the old stuff that's not good. So relativity is just
like that. It works for all velocities up to the speed of light, but if you
let <i>v/c </i>go to zero then you will finally get back Newtonian mechanics.
Similarly, quantum mechanics works for very, very tiny objects, the atomic
scale, but when you apply it to big things you'll find that the world begins to
look Newtonian. Similarly, the end of geometric optics came from a series of
experiments, and I will tell you why we didn't realize there was something
wrong with it for a while. </p>
<p>So here's an
experiment you could do. Here a screen and there's some light coming from
here, and there's a hole, and behind this screen is another screen. So I'm not
good at drawing, so you should imagine this is coming out of the blackboard,
and the ray of light is coming in. It'll form a shadow. I happen to have in
mind a circular hole here. It'll form a disc shape exactly like that. And
another thing, but you will find that as you shrink this, make it smaller and
smaller, suddenly that won't be true anymore. You will find that the light
spreads out like that to bigger and bigger areas. So it's no longer forming
the geometric image of this aperture. It's fanning out, so it's not going to
come from geometrical optics. That's one experiment where something goes
wrong. </p>
<p>There's a more
dramatic experiment which really puts the nail on all kinds of ray theories,
and that's the experiment involving interference. So you take a partition with
two holes in it, and you send light from here, and you put a screen behind.
Are you guys with me? This is a cross section of a plate coming out of the
blackboard. It's got only two holes in it. </p>
<p>Or here's a better
way to think about it. This is the top view of an experiment. I'm looking
down at my lab from the top. There's a wall with two holes in it, and there's
the back wall, and the light is coming from here. If I close this hole what we
will find typically--let me make them slightly bigger to make my point. You'll
find some light. I didn't draw it properly. Most of the brightest areas will
be in front of this hole. So let's see. It'll tend to be big here and kind of
fall off. Now if you block the other one and you shine light here you get
something like that. It's like two windows in the room. You've got one
window, you get some sunlight. You've got another one you get another
sunlight. Now the question is if you open both of them our expectation is that
there is some energy coming here, some energy coming here, and if you open both
you should get the sum of the two energies, which I'm assuming this is the sum
of these two graphs plotted here. By the way, do you know how I'm plotting
this? I hope you understand that this graph really means that distance is
proportional to how bright this point is. See, normally you're used to drawing
graphs like this as a function of distance, but I've turned it around so that
that is the graph of the brightness at different points on the screen. That's
what you expect. You open two windows you get the light equal to the sum of
the two. </p>
<p>For example, if
you're feeling warm it'll be warmer in this region because you're getting light
from two sources. But this experiment also gives you different results under
certain conditions. I'll tell you what the conditions are. What you find then
if one slid open it looks like that. If the other slid open it looks like
that, but with both open it looks like this. That's called interference. The
main point to notice is there are some places, like right here, where you get
less light with one more slid open, okay? And more light with only one open,
less light with two open. In fact, you can arrange it so this is really zero.
I mean, it can come all the way down here. In other words that's the point on
the screen which used to be bright with one slit open. You open the second one
that point becomes dark. That means if you're warm there, and you tell
somebody, &quot;Hey, this is good, open another window,&quot; suddenly you get
nothing. That happens. So when did people realize this is what happens, and
why did people fall for the other graph that looks like this before? The
answer is this. In order to see this phenomenon in which it instead of being a
shadow like this you get a huge spread, or instead of being simply the sum of
these two featureless graphs it starts oscillating, and a certain condition has
to be satisfied. </p>
<p>The condition is the
following. This light, if it has a wavelength &#955;, the &#955;, if it is much, much
smaller than any distance in the problem then you get geometrical optics. So
in this example if this slit is thousand times the wavelength of light then the
shadow, in fact, will be geometrical, but as you make the slit smaller and
smaller until it becomes comparable to the wavelength then you'll find it begin
to fan out. Similarly here, if this distance between the two slits, <i>d</i>,
is much, much bigger than the wavelength and each slit is much, much bigger
than the wavelength, then you will find that you don't see any of this
interference effects. Because what happens is interference effects are always
there, but they oscillate like mad on that screen. Suppose it oscillates like
this, and this could be 10,000 oscillations per centimeter, and your eye is
able to look at it only one millimeter at a time, then you're averaging over a
region and you only find the average of this graph. That looks like what you
got without interference. So in order to see interference you need to make
your apparatus probe the physics at a distance scale comparable to the
wavelength. So that's the answer. </p>
<p>We will see all the
details, but it'll turnout that if you look at light using any equipment, maybe
hole in the wall, two holes in the wall, whatever, whose dimensions are much
bigger than the wavelength you will not see the wave theory of light. You'll
be able to get away with the geometric theory. But once you probe light at
length comparable to wavelength all these funny things will happen. That's why
people didn't realize all these things about light. For example, the
wavelength of light, typical light, is 5,000 angstroms, or 500 nanometers, that
is 500×10<sup>-9</sup>, or 5×10<sup>-7</sup> meters. That means if you forget
the 5 there are 10 million oscillations of the wave within 1 meter, so if you
have an instrument that can pick up that kind of fine features then you will
see the wave nature, but normally you won't. So it's only when people probed
light with very, very tiny holes placed very close to each other they saw it. </p>
<p>The second important
thing to remember is the following. Even if you made the holes very small, and
if you shine white light on this, you will not see any of these patterns. Why
is that? Can you guess? I'm going to tell you everything, but can you guess
why? Yes? You have a guess?</p>
<p><b><b>Student:</b></b> Because they're
white light.</p>
<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b></b>
That's right. White light is made of many colors and many wavelengths, so each
wavelength will form its own pattern, but the maximum and minimum of one guy
won't coincide with that of the other. So where this one wants a maximum
that'll want a minimum, it'll get washed out. So in order to see this effect
you need monochromatic light sent by a source which is sending it at a definite
frequency and wavelength. And these are all things you have to get right
before you will see these effects. </p>
<p>Okay, so now let's
ask ourselves, what is the nature of waves or what is the nature of light that
produces these funny effects? Light, as you know, obeys a wave equation. Let
me call &#968; as whatever it is that's doing the oscillations, generic name is &#968;.
For example, &#968; can be the height of this string that's vibrating. If the
string is doing this from equilibrium &#968; is the deviation from equilibrium. &#968;
can be <i>E</i> or <i>B</i> in the electromagnetic case. &#968; can be the height
of water in a lake above some reference level. That's the reference level, and
the water does some oscillations, &#968; is the deviation from the normal. In the
case of a sound wave, as you know sound wave is deviations in air pressure.
Again, this graph would stand for the normal air pressure, ambient air
pressure, and when you talk you make some oscillations in the density or in the
pressure, and there's the deviation in pressure. So I'm going to call &#968; as any
one of these things. It's something that's oscillating in the wave. And all
these &#968;&#39;s obey the wave equation. The wave equation looks like <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup></i>
minus 1 over the velocity <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dt<sup>2</sup></i> = 0. The
context is different but the equation's the same. The velocity will vary from
problem to problem. </p>
<p>So I'm going to give
a short name for this. I'm going to all it box &#968; = 0. Turns out it's not a
crazy notation. A lot of people actually use that. Do you know why they draw
the box? This is for people who have done somewhat more advanced mathematics.
There's something called del squared which stands for the three spatial derivatives squared. This has got the fourth one so you use
the box. Anyway, it just means I'm tired of writing this. This stands exactly
for this. That's the main point. Now when the wave obeys the wave equation
there's a very, very important property. The important property is it's a
linear equation. It's a linear equation which means if you multiply &#968; by a
number it also satisfies the wave equation. Because if I multiply by number 3
I can take the 3 inside all the derivatives, and I find 3 times &#968; is also a
solution. Another important property is that if someone gives you a solution
called &#968;<sub>1</sub>, another person gives you another solution to the wave
equation which is some other function of x and t called &#968;<sub>2</sub>, then you
can check that if you take any number times &#968;<sub>1</sub>, and any number times
&#968;<sub>2</sub>, and add this, you will find box of a&#968;<sub>1</sub> + b&#968;<sub>2</sub>
is also 0. </p>
<p>You understand why?
When the derivatives come it doesn't care about <i>a</i>. It's a constant.
Box of &#968;<sub>1 </sub>will vanish and the box of &#968;<sub>2 </sub>will vanish. The
whole thing will vanish. But the important property is you can take two
solutions, &#968;<sub>1</sub> and &#968;<sub>2</sub>, multiply each one a number you
like, a constant, and add them, that's also a solution. That's the principle
of superposition, and its origin is in the fact that the underlying &#968; obeys a
linear equation. It's very important that it's linear. I've told you many
times if you have something like that plus &#968;<sup>2</sup> = 0 you can verify
that if &#968;<sub>1</sub> is a solution and &#968;<sub>2</sub> is a solution if you add
them you will get &#968;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + &#968;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, but
that is not the same as &#968;<sub>1</sub> + &#968;<sub>2 </sub>the whole thing squared.
So for nonlinear equations you cannot add the solutions. These are linear
because they involve the first part of &#968;. Okay, now what that means is first
of all &#968; can be positive or negative. What if someone tried to prove to you
that &#968; is always positive? How will you shoot that person down? Do you know?
Yes?</p>
<p><b><b>Student:</b></b> Well, if the
constant is negative 1.</p>
<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> </b>Very
good. If the constant is negative 1 then minus &#968; is also a solution so no one
can ever convince you &#968; should always be positive. Well, if &#968; can be positive
and negative, which means generally it can go up and down in sign, it cannot
stand for things which are always positive such as the brightness of light.
The brightness of light is always positive. The worst think you can have is no
light. You cannot have negative brightness. Therefore, in the electric field
the brightness is not measured by the electric field, the one that oscillates,
but by something quadratic in the field, and that's called the intensity. The
intensity is proportional to square of whatever is oscillating. It is the
measure of energy contained in the wave or brightness. Intensity being
positive definite has some chance of being a description of something that's
positive definite. Not only does it have a chance that happens to be the case,
okay? </p>
<p>See, in all these
problems it's the square of the function that stands for something like
brightness, something like energy per unit second. They're all given by the
square. So the important thing to notice is that when you have one source
producing some light, and a second source producing some light, and you turn
them both on, together they'll produce a field which is the sum of the two
fields. What you can add is the &#968;, which in this case happens to be <i>E</i>
or <i>B</i>. You cannot add the intensities. No one told you the intensities
are additive. The correct process is if &#968;<sub>1 </sub>has an intensity<i> I<sub>1</sub></i>,
let me call it &#968;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, and &#968;<sub>2 </sub>has an intensity <i>I<sub>2
</sub></i>which is &#968;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, then if you put the two waves
together by producing them due to the two sources, <i>I<sub>1+2 </sub></i>is (&#968;<sub>1
</sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. That, you see, has got a &#968;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>
and a &#968;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2&#968;<sub>1</sub>&#968;<sub>2 </sub>which is <i>I<sub>1</sub>
+ I<sub>2</sub> </i>+ something which is indefinite in sign. This can be
positive. This can be negative. This can be 0. So <i>I<sub>1+2 </sub></i>is
not equal to <i>I<sub>1 </sub>+ I<sub>2</sub></i>. It's got the extra stuff,
and that's going to be the origin of all the things we see here. </p>
<p>So it turns out for
waves there's two levels as which things happen. There's a thing that actually
oscillates and then you have to square it to get things that you normally
associate with energy or brightness. And the additive law applies to the
things that oscillates and not to its square. This is the reason why if you've
got two sources each one of it produces a positive intensity <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>.
When you turn them both on the answer is not <i>I<sub>1 </sub>+ I<sub>2</sub></i>,
but this cross term, and the cross term can come and neutralize these
and make it vanish. That's why the experiment when you open a second hole some
places can become darker than they are. Now later on, I mean, not later on,
later this week when we start quantum mechanics we'll deal with the &#968;. That's
called the wave function in quantum mechanics. Now that's a very bizarre
object. I don't want to even talk about it now. Let me just say that it's
something which is intrinsically complex. See, normally for electromagnetic
waves or harmonic oscillator if you've got <i>x</i> = <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>
we're used to taking <i>x</i> = <i>Ae<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> then taking the real
part at the end. That everyone knows <i>x</i> is real. You bring the complex
exponential because it makes it easier to solve certain equations. But in
quantum mechanics all of &#968;, real part and imaginary part together are needed.
It is, by nature, complex. In fact the equations of quantum mechanism, the
analog of Newton's Laws, or the analog of the wave equation will have an <i>i</i>
in them. There's an <i>i</i> in the equation for &#968;, so you cannot get rid of
it. </p>
<p>So in those cases
what you want to think about the analog of intensity cannot be &#968;<sup>2</sup>,
because &#968;<sup>2</sup>, if you really mean by &#968;<sup>2</sup> the real part of &#968; +
<i>i</i> times the imaginary part of &#968; whole thing squared, you see that is &#968;<sub>real</sub><sup>2</sup>
- &#968;<sub>imaginary</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>i</i>&#968;<sub>real</sub>&#968;<sub>imaginary</sub>.
What's wrong with this? If you want this to stand for something positive
definite this is definitely not it. Can you see that? In the simple case
where &#968; is purely imaginary you see it's negative, but neither positive, not
even real. So you must know what I should do in the case where &#968; is
intrinsically complex to define something positive. Any guess on what it is?
Yes?</p>
<p><b><b>Student:</b> </b>Take the ________.</p>
<p><b><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b></b>
Could take the absolute value of &#968;, or another way to say that is you want to
take &#968;&#42;&#968;. But anyway, I'm doing some of this today because I want you to be on
top of this before Wednesday. I've given you enough warning. I ruined your
spring break by sending you notes on complex numbers so you can read them. If
you know it already it's fine, but you should be able to understand the meaning
of real part, imaginary part, absolute value squared, things like E<sub>I</sub>&#952;,
okay? That's going to be used a lot. By anyway, if I take &#968;&#42;&#968; that becomes &#968;<sub>real</sub>
+ <i>i</i> times &#968;<sub>imaginary</sub> times &#968;<sub>real</sub> - <i>i</i> times
&#968;<sub>imaginary</sub>. And if you do the whole thing you will find it's &#968;<sub>real</sub><sup>2
</sup>+ &#968;<sub>imaginary</sub><sup>2</sup>. That's, of course, never negative.
So when you do complex waves they will also obey the superposition principle
for &#968;, but the analog of intensity, which is the positive definite number you
extract from &#968;, will be that. </p>
<p>You can also write
this as absolute value &#968;<sup>2</sup>. When you do complex don't forget
absolute value. When you do real either you can square the &#968; or you can take
the absolute value. It doesn't make any difference. For the real function the
simple squared and the absolute value squared are both the same. All right, so
now I'm going to start with trying to understand interference of waves by doing
the following. Usually you get interference when two people are sending you a
signal. One person is sending you a signal &#968;<sub>1</sub> and the signal may be
traveling in space, but I want you to sit at once place and just register
what's coming to where you are. For example, you could be in one part of a
lake and someone is rocking the boat there and sending out ripples, the ripples
come to where you are, and let's say it's periodic, and at the location where
you are let it be of the form <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. So <i>A</i> is the
amplitude and &#969; is the angular frequency. If you like, it's 2&Pi; times <i>f</i>
where <i>f</i> is the normal frequency. Then another wave is coming towards
you. It is <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, but it comes at a different phase &#934;. </p>
<p>Now the phase &#934;, if you've got only
a single wave you can choose &#934;
to be 0. Because &#934; is--what does &#934; do? cos<i>&#969;t</i>
likes to have a maximum of <i>t</i> = 0, cos<i>(&#969;t + </i><i>&#934;</i><i>)</i> has a maximum
somewhat earlier. You can always reset your clock so that whenever it hits a
maximum you press your clock and set it to 0 you can get rid of &#934;. But you cannot get
rid of &#934; from two wave functions.
You cannot choose them both to have their maximum at the same time because
they're not. In fact this fellow goes like this. This one has got an extra
lead on it, so it'll sort of start here. So it'll go like this. If you went
backward it'll have its maximum at some negative time. So what we want to do
is to add these two signals to get &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub>. Think of
this as water waves. That's the best example. Okay, someone shaking the
water, ripples are coming out. They're coming to where you are. With only the
first vibrator sending the waves you get this. With the second one you get
this. But now if both are doing it then this is what you will get. And the
height of the water will actually be simply the sum of the two heights. It's
not obvious but true, okay? </p>
<p>If you agitate the
water with one source and it produces the height here, and with the second one
that produces another height, if you do both it's not obvious, it's not a
logical necessity, but it's a fact that the height of the water at any point
will simply be the sum of these two. So you've got to add these guys. So you
do that you get <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i> + <i>A</i>cos<i>(&#969;t+</i><i>&#934;</i><i>).</i> Now you've got to
go back to your trig identities and remember the following: cosine &#945; + cosine &#946;
is twice cosine &#945; + &#946; over 2 times cosine &#945; - &#946; over 2. If you've got a
formula like this, of which there are numerous ones, and if you have any doubts
you can check some special cases. For example, if &#945; is equal to &#946; I want to
get cos &#945; + cos &#945; or twice cosine &#945;. On the right hand side I get twice cosine
&#945; + &#945; over 2, which is cosine &#945; times cosine of 0 which is 1. Now it doesn't
prove it's the right formula, but it will tell you that if it is wrong in some
way then you can tell. </p>
<p>Anyway, this is the
right formula applied to this problem. If I apply it to this problem, I get
twice cosine &#968; over 2, I'm sorry, 2<i>A</i> cosine &#968; over 2 times cosine <i>&#969;t
+ </i><i>&#934;</i>/2. This is just
plugging in. It is an example. This whole thing looks like a pre-factor,
doesn't depend on time and this is oscillating. So this is a problem which
looks like some amplitude cosine &#969;t + &#934;/2. The amplitude <i>&#195;</i> is 2<i>A</i> cosine &#934;/2. And if I want
the amplitude to be always positive I will take it to mean the absolute value
of cosine &#934;/2. So here's the
answer, guys. When you add these two waves--if you draw the pictures it's kind
of confusing, but this is the simple answer. It says the total will be a new
wave whose amplitude is <i>&#195;. &#195; </i>can be as big as 2<i>A</i>, or it can be
as small as 0 depending on what the cosine does. And then it will also not be
in step with this guy, not in step with this guy, it'll be half way between
them. Its phase will be &#934;/2. Now let's check
the formula in a couple of special cases. If &#934; is equal to 0 that means the two signals are
identical. We don't need any fancy stuff to know the answer is 2<i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
If &#934; is equal to 0,
that's <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, cos 0 is 1 and you get the 2<i>A</i>. The one
other case you can do very easily in your head is when &#934; is equal to &Pi;. If &#934; is equal to &Pi; cosine
of <i>&#969;t </i>+ &Pi; is just minus cosine <i>&#969;t</i>. That means this wave starts
like this. Wherever this is going up this is going, I'm sorry, it starts like
this one. So when that one is doing this, this will do that and it'll always
be opposite to it. If you add them you'll get identically 0. Anyway, they are
the two extreme cases where you can check your formula. So this is the only
formula you will need, so you should get that into your head. There is some
natural frequency &#969; and the phase is increasing at the rate &#969; so it's <i>&#969;t</i>.
The other guy has shifted by phase &#934;. Their sum has a new amplitude and a new phase. I'm
doing a special case where the two waves have the same amplitude. If they're
different amplitudes it becomes more messy, but that's not necessary. </p>
<p>So I'm going to do
this once more, but with complex numbers, because I want you guys to get used
to complex numbers. And I think the only way you're going to get used to
anything is if you use it a lot. You can sit down and read it at bedtime. It
may help you go to sleep, but it doesn't do any good. So I'm going to keep
using the complex numbers, because starting Wednesday we're going to be doing a
lot more. But you don't need very fancy complex numbers. It's at the level
that I'm doing now. So let us now do exactly this addition using complex
numbers. So let's take one single wave first, &#968;<sub>1</sub> = <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
We agree there's no complex number here, but let's write it as the real part
Re(<i>Ae<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>). Now you remember the complex number is <i>z</i> =
mod <i>ze<sup>i&#952;</sup></i> looks like this. It's got a length equal to mod <i>z</i>
and there's an angle equal to &#952;. That's the complex number <i>z</i>. If you
want you can think of it as that. It starts at the origin and terminates at
the point <i>z</i>. Its real part is really this one, this mod <i>z</i> cosine
&#952;. The imaginary part is mod <i>z</i> sine &#952;, but I just want the cosine.
It's the real part of this guy. So what does this look like? Well, let me
draw you a picture here. This looks like this. It's got length <i>A</i> and
the angle is <i>&#969;t</i>, and as time goes by it goes round and round. </p>
<p>So at any future time
it'll be on this circle. At this instant its real part is just this one, <i>A</i>
cosine <i>&#969;t</i>. So if you like, the complex number has fixed magnitude, goes
round and round in a circle. The real part of it has got a maximum of <i>A</i>
here, a 0 there, and -<i>A</i>, and that'll be the cosine, because the
horizontal part of this is <i>A</i> cosine <i>&#969;t</i>. So we can keep track of
the thing we're interested in by letting this vector rotate in a circle by
looking at a shadow on the <i>x</i>-axis, okay? If you have some light shining
from here you ask, &quot;What image does it cast?&quot; Well, it comes there.
So for a single complex number it's not very useful, but now let me bring in a
second complex number. Let's bring in a second complex number, so I'll draw a
new figure for the two of them. So you should understand this is a dynamic
situation. This is not a fixed vector. As <i>t </i>increases this is
constantly rotating, okay? And as it rotates if you follow the shadow on the <i>x</i>-axis
you get the real part, which is our function. </p>
<p>Now if you've got a
second function, so let me take a circle of radius <i>A</i>, and here's the
first guy who's angle <i>&#969;t</i>. The second one is also on that circle, but
you've got an extra angle &#934;.
You follow that? So this &#968;<sub>1</sub> this is &#968;<sub>2</sub>, actual &#968; is
actually the real part of these two guys, but I'm going to work with the
complex number first. We all remember in the end to take the real part. And
I'm using the fact that the real part of &#968;<sub>1</sub> + &#968;<sub>2</sub> is the real
part of &#968;<sub>1</sub> + the real part of &#968;<sub>2</sub>. Therefore if you want
to add two real waves you can add the complex waves and then take the real
part. You can take it before or you can take it after. Our philosophy is
going to be to add the vectors first then take the real part. I want you to
think about, what is the sum of these two guys going to do? As usual I'll give
you a few seconds to think about it, okay? By vector addition you do this parallelogram. You draw one copy of this here and one copy
of that here, and you join this to that. That line is &#968;<sub>1</sub> + &#968;<sub>2</sub>,
so their sum would rotate on that circle, but let's look at the sum. What's
this angle here? </p>
<p>You can tell from the similarity of this parallelogram that
that angle is &#934;/2, because
the angle &#934; between them
is split evenly between the diagonal of the parallelogram. So you already tell
that the new wave, which is obtained by adding these two, when this guy rotates
we'll have a phase of &#934;/2. And what's its amplitude? That we're asking, what's
the length of the diagonal of this parallelogram? Then you use whatever
theorem, and to say <i>&#195;<sup>2</sup></i> is the square of one guy, square of the other guy + 2
times length of <i>A</i> length of <i>A</i> cosine of the angle between them. I mean, cosine of this
angle, &#934;. So this
becomes 2<i>A</i>
squared times 1 + cosine &#934;. Now I remind you of another trigonometry identity that 1
+ cosine &#934; is 2 times
cosine squared &#952;/2. That is <i>&#195;<sup>2</sup></i>. Then for <i>&#195;</i> if you take the square root of this it's 2<i>A</i> times cosine
&#934;/2. </p>
<p>So we just reproduced the answer, but I want you to
understand that the sum of these two complex numbers is a number of length 2<i>A</i> cosine &#934;/2. It goes around at the same &#969;, but it is
shifted. Its phase is half way between the phase of the two waves. That half
comes because in a parallelogram the diagonal will bisect the angle &#934;. So this answer is the same as what we got
from trigonometry. It's not going to give you anything new, but it's helpful
to think of our actual &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub>, if you like, is the real
part, which is the projection on the x-axis, but it's a lot easier to add these
arrows than to add the real parts. </p>
<p>Okay, now I'm going to do the last part of it one more way,
so once more with feeling. So let me do that, &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub>.
This is when I'm not going to draw any pictures. Some people like to draw
pictures. Some people like to do the algebra. So I'm one of these algebra
types because when they draw a picture I don't understand anything. So for
fellows like me &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub> looks like this, &#968;<sub>1</sub> is
<i>Ae<sup>I&#969;t</sup></i>, &#968;<sub>2</sub> is <i>Ae<sup>I&#969;t+</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>, which I can write like
this. </p>
<p>So let's write it as a common <i>Ae<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> times
1 + <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. This much, I think, is
automatic. Your spinal cord can do this calculation, but the next move
requires a little bit of planning and we do this. <i>Ae<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> I'm
going to pull half the phase of that <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sup>/2</sup></i> times <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sup>/2</sup></i><i> + e<sup>+i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sup>/2</sup></i>. You can see if I open all the brackets this goes back to
being 1. This goes back to being <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. The reason I do this is
that I want everybody to know this is a famous combination, <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#952;</sup></i><i> + e<sup>-i</sup></i><i><sup>&#952;</sup></i> is twice cosine &#952;, so
twice cosine &#934;/2. So the
sum of all these complex numbers became 2<i>A</i> cosine &#934;/2 times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t+</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sup>/2</sup></i>. You can see that this is the amplitude. This is the
length of the vector, and this is angle by which it's rotating. Can you see
that? That's like mod &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub>, and there's the <i>i </i>times whatever
the phase of &#968;<sub>1 </sub>+ &#968;<sub>2</sub> is. There are many ways to do this,
but having done it three ways you should at least remember the answer. When
you add two waves both at the same frequency &#969;, with a relative phase between
them, their sum oscillates at the same frequency with the phase half way
between the two with an amplitude which is 2<i>A</i> cosine &#934;/2. </p>
<p>Now I'm going to start applying this result to a variety of
problems. The problem I'm going to do is the following. I'm going to
take--let me start fresh here. Now I'm going to do the interference problem.
For interference you take these two slits and some wave come from here. It
hits the two slits. Now here's some part of physics that I'm just going to
tell you without proving it. I hate doing that, but once in a while we have to
do that. I can only appeal to you sense of logic. That is the assumption that
if you look at this wall which is completely covered except for two tiny holes,
let's say, then any light on the back, on the other side, will be in the form
of two glowing objects, and with the two holes in the wall will act like two
light sources. That's how it works, for example. You open the window, the
window looks like a source of light. It's coming from somewhere, but to the
people inside the room that a source of light and that's a source of light.
And if the things are very close to each other, this hole, or very small it'll
look like a point source of light, and for the point source of light the waves
will emanate like this with that as a center, and another set of waves with
this at the center, and the two will be in sync because this wave front hits
them both at the same time. And I'm going to sit somewhere here, and I'm going
to measure what's going on. </p>
<p>So you imagine this is water waves. This is a top view of
the water wave. This is a crest and there's a trough in between, another
crest, another trough, another crest, and I'm sitting here and these wave are
going by, so two waves will come to me. One will come from here, and one will
come from there. Let that distance be <i>r</i>. Let that
distance be <i>r + &#948;</i>. So I am sitting here. So the water here will be bobbing
up and down by an amount equal to what this guy tells me to do plus what that
guy tells me to do. So I'm only asking you, &quot;What is the amplitude of
vibrations of the water here with both of them open?&quot; Well, you've done
it many, many times. If the first one sends a signal <i>A</i>cos<i>(kr - &#969;t)</i>, by the way,
you have seen waves in one dimension whether it's cos or sine of <i>kx - &#969;t</i>. That's the
wave in which the fronts look like this. When you advance the next the lines
of constant phase or maximum of the cosine are lines like this. But this is
not a plane wave it's a circular wave. It spreads out in all directions, and
the points of constant phase are circles, if you like. See, here if <i>x</i> is a constant
you get a certain phase, and as you vary <i>x</i> at a given
instant you'll get the various maxima here. Here things depend on <i>r</i>. At a given <i>r</i> the phase is
constant, so if the cosine is maximized at one value of <i>r </i>it's maximized
at all values of <i>r</i>. So all the crests will lie on that semicircle on this
side, and all the troughs will be half way in between. And I remind you that <i>k</i> is related to
the family of wavelength by this formula, 2&Pi;/&#955;. You see that? If this <i>k</i> was 2&Pi;/&#955;, <i>kr</i> looks like 2&Pi;<i>r</i>/&#955;. What that
tells you is if to any given <i>r</i> you add a &#955; it doesn't make a difference because you're
adding a 2&Pi; to that trigonometric function. That's the relation between <i>k</i> and &#955;, it's
inverted. Okay, that is &#968;<sub>1</sub>. &#968;<sub>2 </sub>has got the same
amplitude cosine <i>kr + k&#948; - &#969;t </i>because this path, I'm assuming is longer by an amount &#948;,
so the <i>r</i>
measured from this hole is going to be <i>r</i> + &#948;. So what
happens when you add them? It's the same trick we have done many times. All
you have to do is identify <i>k</i>&#948; as this number &#934;. That's the phase difference between the two. And that's
the phase difference because even though these apertures are acting as
synchronized sources of waves it takes this wave somewhat longer to get to my
point than this one, so there is a delay and that's why it arrives with some
shift &#934;. </p>
<p>Yes? So what's the amplitude here? Well, we don't have
to do this over and over again. I already told you <i>&#195;</i> is 2<i>A</i> cosine of &#934;/2 becomes cosine of <i>k</i>&#948;/2. So when
is the amplitude big and when is the amplitude zero? That's what we're
asking. If you go along the perpendicular bisector here you can see by
symmetry that two <i>r</i>'s are equal and &#948; is 0 then amplitude is 2 times <i>A</i>. So here the
two waves are completely in step and they give you a wave of double the
height. And double the height means four times the intensity because intensity
is proportional to square of the amplitude. So this point will have an
amplitude which is 2<i>A</i>. I'm just going to draw that part there, but now let's go
to another place here where <i>k</i>&#948;/2 is &Pi;/2. Well, cosine &Pi;/2 is 0. At that point the
amplitude will vanish, and then you will get no vibration of water there.
Let's understand precisely why that is true. So <i>k</i>&#948;/2, <i>k</i> is 2&Pi;/&#955; times
&#948;/2 is &Pi;/2 canceling the 2 with the 2 the &Pi; with the &Pi; I find &#948; is &#955;/2. That
means this second wave has to travel a distance half a wavelength more than the
first one. I think you can see what that means. </p>
<p>I mean, here's a wave going along. If that guy hits there
and you're half a wavelength behind this guy will hit there. When you go a
half a wavelength in a wave you're doing exactly the opposite of what you're
doing here. At every instant you can take any wave you want, take a flash
photograph, go to some point and go half a wavelength you'll find you're doing
minus of that. Because half a wavelength adds the phase of &Pi; to the cosine or
sine, and sine when you add a &Pi; goes to minus itself. So that's why you get
destructive interference here because the signal from this one is telling the
water to go up. The signal from that one is telling the water to go down so it
doesn't do anything. A little later the first one says go down, second one
says go up then also nothing happens. So you can get two signals that can
actually cancel each other. That's the property of waves. </p>
<p>It's not the property of intensity. You might naively
think, &quot;Hey, this used to be bright without the second slit. It used to
be bright without the first slit. Maybe with both it'll be twice as
bright,&quot; and that's wrong because what adds is not intensity. What adds
is the amplitude, the wave is the function &#968;, and &#968; being positive or negative
has the possibility of getting canceled by a second source. So one source can
cancel another source in &#968; and therefore kill the intensity. That's why if you
now plot this graph you'll get a minimum here, you'll get a maximum there, and
minimum here, and maximum there. So, where are the places where you get a
maximum, and where are the places where you get a minimum? So let's write that
down. You remember the <i>&#195;</i> was 2<i>A</i> cosine <i>k</i>&#948;/2. Therefore, <i>&#195;</i> is equal to 2<i>A</i> whenever this cosine, I mean, let's take the absolute
value of this for the amplitude. Whenever <i>k</i>&#948;/2 is equal
to &Pi;, equal to 3&Pi; plus or minus, plus or minus 5&Pi; and so on that means 2&Pi;&#948;/&#955; is
equal to &Pi;--let me see. I'm doing something wrong here. I'm trying to ask,
when is it a maximum? The maximum is when this angle is either 0 or &Pi;, that's
right, so why am I getting half a wavelength is what I'm trying to understand.
</p>
<p>Okay, delta over 2. So this is 2&Pi;/&#955; times &#948;/2 = 0. Oh,
I'm sorry. I know what I did wrong. This whole thing has to be 0. That's
good. That means &#948; is 0. What's the next time it'll be a maximum? When this
whole thing is equal to &Pi;, so let me see what I get for that. These two cancel
and I get &#948; is equal to &#955;. Can you see that, 2 cancels 2, &Pi; cancels &Pi;, &#948;
equals &#955;, so you can have &#948; equal to 0, &#955; plus or minus, plus or minus.
They're all going to be bright if you're talking about light. They're going to
be huge waves if you're talking about water. On the other hand if this is
equal to &Pi;/2, 3&Pi;/2 etcetera, plus or minus, then there's going to be dark, that
means that &#948; is equal to &#955;/2, 3&#955;/2 etcetera. So there will be bright and dark,
and bright and dark fringes on the screen. If you go to the screen here the
midpoint will be bright, but it'll be oscillating like that many, many times. </p>
<p>This was the experiment that was done by Young. Young did
the experiment with light and showed that it has an interference pattern. He
did not know what light was. He did not produce electromagnetic waves, but you
don't need to know that. You shine the light, you get the dark and bright, and
dark and bright, and I will tell you in a minute how we can find the wavelength
of light from this experiment. You can probably guess, but I'll do that in a
minute. He got the wavelength of light, but he didn't know what it is that was
vibrating, but he got the wavelength. </p>
<p>So let's ask ourselves exactly where on this screen I will
get dark and bright, and dark and bright. So for that you've got to do a
little more geometry now. So let's do that geometry here. So here is the
double slit. I want to go in some direction. I'm assuming the screen is so
far away that the rays can be treated as parallel. And I want to go at an
angle theta so that these lengths are equal. This is the extra length delta
here, and this is the distance between the two slits. </p>
<p>So you can see delta is equal to <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i>, because this
angle &#952; between the horizontal and the ray is the same as the perpendicular of
the horizontal and the perpendicular to the ray. It's at that angle. So <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> is &#948;, and
that had to be equal to either 0 or an integer multiple of &#955; for a maximum, or
equal to plus or minus &#955;/2, plus or minus 3&#955; over 2 half wavelengths for a
minimum. </p>
<p>Can you imagine doing this calculation? If someone says,
&quot;Here is light of some wavelength, 5,000 angstroms or 500 nanometers, the
slits are separated by some microns or whatever,&quot; then you can say,
&quot;What's the angle &#952; at which I will get a maximum or a minimum? Well, you
can already do this calculation. If you wanted the first maximum you said <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> equal to
wavelength. You solve for sine &#952; and look at a calculator, it'll tell you what
theta is. Then you can go and see, &quot;Maybe I can get two lambda,&quot;
then that can also give you another &#952;. But remember, it cannot go on forever
because at some point sine theta, which will be some multiple of &#955;/<i>d</i> where m is an
integer, if it's bigger than 1 no luck. Sine theta cannot be bigger than 1.
So you'll get some number of this maxima then it'll stop. That's because if
you've got two signals coming from here to here only if you go in this
direction will you get the maximum phase, the maximum path difference if you go
straight up, and if that's not enough to be some multiple of &#955; there's no use
going any further because theta you can get is 90 degrees, and the biggest path
length you can get is then the space between the slits d, and your multiple
wavelength should fit into that. So I hope all of you understand this very
simple experiment, the double slit experiment. So light comes from the left.
These two points act like sources of light. They send out spherical or
circular waves. You go to a screen far away and you add the contribution from
the two. If this and that differ in the path length by an integer number of
wavelengths it doesn't matter. They will arrive in step. I mean, the
ninety-sixth maximum will come when the ninety-fifth one from this one comes,
but we don't care. A maximum is a maximum. If they differ by half a
wavelength or three halves wavelengths then they will cancel, and what I said
on the top also goes on the bottom. </p>
<p>Now sometimes there is a little extra geometry you can do
which is the following. This may be some homework problem. If you put a
screen here at the distance <i>L</i> and the patterns look like this, this is the central
maximum, and I ask you, &quot;Where is the central minimum measured from
here,&quot; well, you call that distance as <i>y</i>. Then you
see <i>y/L</i> is tan<i>&#952;</i> and <i>&#952;</i> should be
such that <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> is &#955;/2. Are
you with me? You find the directions of minima. Once you find the found the
direction of a maximum or a minimum it is simple trigonometry to find that if a
screen is <i>L</i> meters
away how much do you have to move in the vertical direction. That's very easy
trig. You can calculate and you can predict. That's what Young did because he
knew the distance between the maximum and the minimum. He knew how far the
screens were. He knew the slit separation. All he did not know was the
wavelength and he got the wavelength without knowing what the waves are made
of. </p>
<p>Now you can see why you got fooled in the old days. If y/L
is--so let's make an estimation of how far apart these maxima and minima are in
this graph. Since they repeat let me just take the first minimum, and that's a
rough measure of the oscillations. How far apart are these maxima and minima?
Well, the first one occurs when <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> is equal to &#955;/2, or sin<i>&#952;</i>, which is
roughly going to be &#952; for small angles is &#955;/2<i>d</i>. Now if you
pick any &#955; you like, visible light is 5,000 angstroms. That is 5000×10<sup>-8 </sup>centimeters.
And suppose your screen is 1 centimeter away? Then you get 5×10<sup>-3</sup>.
So it's roughly one-thousandth of a radian is the difference between the
maximum and the minimum. The interference pattern, even though I've shown it
this way here, actually oscillates very, very rapidly. Okay, the angle of
difference between the maximum and a minimum and a maximum and a minimum is one-thousandth
of a radian. So even if you go a centimeter away you will find that your
probes, like your eyeball, if your eyeball is this big, okay? It's going to
pick up so many of these waves at one time. It cannot tell the maximum and
minimum. That's why we think there is no interference because you only pick
the average value. That's why you have to do very careful measurements. Okay,
so that is double slit. </p>
<p>Okay, here's another thing which will be very useful for
people who are doing biology, or maybe even chemistry. Let's call it
diffraction grading. In a diffraction grading you take a piece of opaque glass
covered with black soot then you draw fine lines on it, evenly spaced lines so
that the effect is the following. This whole thing is dark except you've made
some tiny places where light can come through like that, and the light's coming
like this. Are you with me? This is my solid screen with a few places through
which light can come, and every one of them becomes a source. It's like a
double slit experiment except you've got million of lines, and you want to ask,
&quot;What will they do?&quot; In the forward direction if you put an object,
if you put a screen very far away that's roughly infinity they all take the
same path distance. They all go to the same distance. Therefore they will all
be in step. So in the forward direction you will get a big maximum, because
for every color the path is the same in the forward direction. But think of
another direction which is not the forward direction. It's some other angle.
Then this guy and this guy are out of step by an amount &#948;. This guy and this
guy are out of step by an amount &#948;. This guy and this guy are out of step by 2&#948;,
so all the sources add up at face difference of &#948;, 2&#948;, 3&#948;, 4&#948; and so on. </p>
<p>And suppose you want them all to be still coherent. What
will you require? What will ensure that all those things are coherent in a
certain direction? Any guess on what &#948; should be? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> If &#948; is equal to the
wavelength this guy and this guy are a wavelength apart. We already know they
are in step from the double slit experiment. This guy and this guy are a
wavelength apart. This guy and this guy are two wavelengths apart. That is
just fine. Therefore if you pick a direction in which that delta is either a wavelength
or an integer multiple of a wavelength all the things will add coherently.
Therefore the favorable direction for a bright maximum satisfy, again, <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> = <i>m</i>&#955; where m can
be 0 plus or minus 1 plus or minus 2. These are the maximum. Except here in
the forward direction where &#952; is equal to 0--okay, here's the point. Let us
find the first maximum away from the center. The center is not even counted,
center being white. All the colors will come to the forward direction and you
will get a big bright area here, but look at what happens to the different
colors. This condition, let's take <i>m</i> = 1, <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> = &#955;. Whose &#955; are we talking about, right? Red light is one
&#955;, blue light's another &#955;. So each one will pick a different &#955;, each one will
pick a different direction for this first order maximum. </p>
<p>So that means the white light, when it comes in this
direction, will be split into many colors. It is just that they all shrink to
one line here in the center, but any other place the lines will split. That's
because &#955; depends on the color; d is, of course, the spacing between these
little lines on the grating, so sine &#952; is a function of &#955;. So it acts like a
prism. It splits the colors. So this is called the first order maximum.
Between this and that will be a minimum. Then there'll be another minimum.
Then there's a maximum. It's harder to calculate the minimum, very easy to
calculate the maximum. So it's easy to calculate the maximum. That's when
everybody has to add. Minimum is more complicated because everybody has to
cancel. You've got to add the little arrows in different directions and ask
when they cancel. You can do it, but it's a little more complicated. But we
can sort of imagine that between the maxima would lie the minima, but the
colors will get split. That's important. </p>
<p>So this is how people find out. So if you send white light
it will split into all the colors. If you look at white light coming from the
sun you'll find some colors are missing because what happens is hydrogen in the
surface of the sun will absorb some of the colors because its atomic--its atom
likes to absorb light at a certain color. That color is missing, missing in the
spectrum. So in this whole area you'll have a little cavity. Somebody is
missing and you can easily tell from the wavelength that it's some emission
line of hydrogen. That tells you the sun contains hydrogen. That's how people
know what elements are sitting on different planets. How does anybody know
what they're made of? It was not at all clear in the ancient days that stars
and planets are made of the same thing you are, right? People thought moon was
made of cheese. Well, that's pretty much the same thing that you are, but
something else, okay? But they didn't know. They thought that heavenly bodies
and earthly bodies, but now we find it's the same elements because you can find
the spectra lines either by their presence or by their absence. So this is the
kind of spectroscopy you do.</p>
<p>Okay, now I'm going to do one other thing which is
extremely important. That is to explain why when light comes through a hole of
some size d instead of forming a shadow like this it spreads out a lot into
something much broader. So let's understand that, okay? Here is light coming
in. Now what you can do is this aperture is going to be bright. When you see
it from this side it'll be glowing. So let's treat every point of it as a
source of light. In the forward direction everybody's in step, but if you go
off at some angle they're not in step because you can see this guy is behind
that guy, and that guy's behind by that amount. Each one is somewhat behind
the leader. Now my claim that if this number here is &#955;, what do you think will
happen? In that direction if that spacing is &#955; is that going to be a maximum
or a minimum? Anybody want to guess? Pardon me? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Minimum.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> And on what do you base
that?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because the &#955;/2 ________ the minimum, and...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> But this thing is &#955;.
Usually &#955; between two holes was considered good, but now it's bad. The reason
is that it's just not the top guy and the bottom guy. It's all these little
guys in between. So if this and that differ by &#955;, by similar triangles, you
see that's &#955; over two? So this fellow will cancel that fellow, and the second
guy will be canceled by the second guy from below. So when the whole phase
shift is &#955;, or the path difference is &#955;, you can pair the points into two at a
time each differing by &#955;/2 and we know they will separately cancel. So for a
single slit the fraction <i>d</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> = &#955; is the first minimum, and after that some funny things
happen which are negligible, but the light spreads out to that angle. And this
is the diffraction of light by an opening. And let's look at it. Sine &#952; is &#955;/<i>d</i>. </p>
<p>Suppose &#955; is 10<sup>-4</sup> and <i>d</i> is 1? Sine &#952;
= theta 10<sup>-4</sup> that means the angular spread is 1 over ten-thousandth
of a radian. That's the extent to which light won't go straight. It'll spread
out, but the spread is 1 over ten-thousandth of a radian. It's very small.
But take a case where &#955; and <i>d</i> become comparable, maybe d is equal to 2&#955;, then sine &#952; is
one-half. That's 30 degrees. It's already beginning to spread out. That's
why I said earlier that if you want to see the effect of wave optics you need
to have the length in the problem, which is the size of the hole, and the
wavelength in the problem comparable to each other. If the wavelength is much
smaller than the dimensions of your experiment you can get away with the ray
optics, and you need wave optics only when the condition is not met. So I
remind you one more time why people thought ray optics was good. They were not
able to produce slits which are this narrow. Most slits you produce by
drilling a hole with your electric drill will be many, many times the
wavelength of light. That means its angular spread will be slightly non-zero,
but instead of a shadow that big you'll get a shadow that big. You won't
know. Similarly the interference pattern, the interference pattern for
microscopic separations between the slits will be so tight that your eye cannot
detect it even if you use light of one color, and if you use light of many colors
it'll wash out anyway because each lambda likes to peak at a different angle,
so different colors would wipe it out. So I wanted to let you know why it is
that people believed in geometric optics in the beginning because they didn't
do experiments. This is why every theory will fall. One day somebody has the
technology to produce slits which are very, very near and to get light which is
very pure of a definite color then you will see something new. Then you've got
to figure out what it is. But when Young did the experiment and saw the
interference they knew right away it's waves because people had played with
water waves, and they knew with water waves that you can have interference. </p>
<p>Okay, here's another thing you can do. Here is a bunch of
atoms at the surface of some metal. Metal's down here, and I'm shining light.
You know how reflection works? The light hits the atom. Atom absorbs the
light and it reemits the light. That's what reflection is. You don't just
bounce off. You get absorbed and get reemitted. Now the problem is if you
reemit you reemit in all directions. You don't just reemit in one direction.
The question you can ask is, why is it that <i>i = r</i> for
reflection? That's what I want to explain to you. So this guy emits something.
There's a wave emanating from this. This guy emits something, wave emanating
from that. So let's take two rays going off in some direction. And let's just
ask when these two guys will be in step in terms of the emitted wave. So you
see the light signal is coming from here. It hits this one first. Are you
with me? So this emits right way. Its signal has started taking off in the
final direction. This guy is delayed because it hasn't hit this, but once they
start moving toward the eye this is closer than this one, so you see this one
and that one, if you want to make a real comparison--well, this is bad
picture. Let me draw you another picture where there's a good competition
between them. </p>
<p>So let's see. Suppose I had a really bad idea and I thought
they reflect like this. I'll show you that won't work. That's all I want to
do. You see what you should do is draw perpendicular here and that's the extra
distance this has to travel, right? And you will draw a perpendicular here and
let's see, what's the extra distance the other has to travel? It has to travel
that extra distance. So if you draw those two angles you will find--let's see
which angle I want to take. If you call this alpha you'll find <i>d</i> cosine &#945;<sub>1</sub>
is <i>d</i> cosine
&#945;<sub>2</sub> or &#945;<sub>1</sub> = &#945;<sub>2</sub>. That means <i>I = r</i>. You see
that? Maybe I should repeat the picture here so everybody can see. I just
need two of them. So one let me draw like this. Let me draw the second at
what is definitely not <i>i = r</i>. So here I'm saying draw that perpendicular and draw that
perpendicular. Starting from infinity these two have the same length, those
two have the same length. This is an extra length traveled by this guy.
That's the extra length traveled by that guy, okay? </p>
<p>So if you call that angle alpha, you call that angle &#946;, and
if this is <i>d</i>, you
can see that <i>d</i> cosine
&#945; must be <i>d</i> cosine
&#946; or &#945; should be &#946;. That is a very interesting result. It tells you why <i>i = r</i> is true.
See, if light is made up of particles that bounce off a wall and ricochet with <i>i = r</i> you can
understand that from conservation momentum. But light is a wave and when the
atoms absorb light they emit in all directions, but only in this direction will
everybody be in step because once I made sure these two guys are in step you
can repeat it for these two and those two. You'll find that's the direction in
which every single guy is in step. So <i>i = r</i> is the
direction in which the re-radiated light arrives in step in only one direction,
and that's the direction with the angle of incidence is the angle of the
reflection. You understand why there is a difference?</p>
<p>Okay, one last thing I should mention, because I've given a
problem for you, and I just want to tell you one trick you may not know. And
you can read up. The book is very good in that. If you've got some oil slick
on a rainy day, there's water here. This is an oil slick. You see all kind of
colors in the oil slick? This is to explain why it is. So white light comes
or any light comes, bounces off the top surface. The light also bounces off the
bottom surface. And the sum of those two hit your eye. Suppose you want to
arrange it so that blue light cancels out in the process? What will it take to
cancel? I claim first of all the wavelength in this medium is <i>n</i> times the
wave. It's &#955;/<i>n</i>. If this is the wavelength here the wavelength in a
medium of refractive and <i>n</i> is &#955;/<i>n</i>. If this whole thing is equal to a full wavelength, this
round trip, I claim you'll get a dark spot. You may think that's wrong because
this guy's gone an extra full wavelength. That should be additive, but it
turns out that when light bounces off in going from a rare to a dense medium it
changes by an extra &Pi;. At the other end when it goes from dense to rare it
doesn't. So you have to add an extra &Pi; to everything you thought. Then you
will find out that when this extra round trip is the full wavelength you get
destructive interference. So if that occurs for a wavelength for blue light
you take blue light out of white light you get some yellowish greenish color.
That's what you see in the oil slick. And if the oil slick thickness varies
different colors will be missing from white at different point. That's why you
see all kinds of different colors in the oil slick. So I agree I didn't do a
good job of this one, but this is the easiest thing to me. The only thing to
do, when you do your homework, if you didn't read the section don't forget
there's an extra factor of &Pi; in the phase shift when you hit the hard medium.</p>
