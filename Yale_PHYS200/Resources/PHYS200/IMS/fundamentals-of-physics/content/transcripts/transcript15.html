<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, so let's start now. This
is the last and final chapter of this subject, and I think it's,
again--we're starting by backing off a little bit towards the end of
last class. I think that there are maybe parts of it were maybe
difficult for you to follow.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of what we were trying to do. We had learned that
space-time is described by four coordinates, so that if you're
following some particle or some event, you label it with four numbers
<i>c</i>, <i>t,</i> <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>, which I want you
to let me combine into the single vector <i>r</i>. They are written as
<i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>,
<i>x</i><sub>3</sub>. Now, I'm of two minds about <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>
and <i>x<sub>3</sub></i>; sometimes I carry them around, sometimes I
don't. <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> is just our familiar <i>x</i>;
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> is <i>y</i> and <i>x<sub>3</sub></i> is <i>z</i>.
It's possible to arrange all the motion to take place in the <i>x</i>
direction, in which case <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> don't change when you go
from one frame to the other, so I don't usually bother with that. But
sometimes I put it back because if you have only two components,
<i>x<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, you might say, "Hey, the
world is two dimensional." So, I want to keep reminding you now we
think of it terms of four dimensions. So, at least for that reason
sometimes they carry all the three components of position, sometimes
only one. But I'm sure you guys can figure out from the context which
is which.</p>

<p>So, going back to the simpler situation of only <i>x</i> and time,
the point of those coordinates is that if you went to a moving frame,
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime will be <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> -
<i>βx<sub>0</sub></i>, divided by the square root. And
<i>x<sub>0</sub></i> prime will be <i>x<sub>0</sub> - β</i> times
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, divided by that square root, where <i>β</i> is
<i>v</i>/<i>c</i>. Sometimes it's useful to introduce <i>γ</i>, which
is [reciprocal of square root of ] 1 - u<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>.
Also to prevent all confusion, <i>u</i> will be the velocity of your
frame relative to mine. <i>v</i> will stand for the velocity of some
particle that we are both studying. So, let's reserve the symbol
<i>v</i> for motion of actual particles, which is why we are there. We
are all observers but we're observing something. That something has a
velocity that I'll call <i>v</i> and you will call <i>w</i>, and
<i>u</i> is the speed relative to your frame and my frame.</p>

<p>All right, so this is the notion of space-time because space and
time are getting mixed up when you go to a new frame of reference. But
even in this world where nothing is sacred, the following combination
is very important, which we denote as <i>X</i> dot <i>X</i>. There's a
new dot product now in space-time. The new dot product will be the
square of the time-like part minus the square of the space-like part.
If you wanted to bring in all the components of space-time, then you
can modify it to <i>x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - r</i> dot <i>r</i>.
<i>r</i> dot <i>r</i> will be <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> +
z<sup>2</sup></i>. So, you can use either notation. Whenever possible I
just keep two, but you've got to remember, this is why it's a
four-dimensional dot product. And this is the same for all people. So,
I can calculate it, you can calculate it, our <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> and
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> will differ, but it's the property of the Lorentz
transformation, that if I square this guy and subtract it from the
square of this guy, on the right-hand side some magical things will
happen and I'll get the same combination without the primes. That's
like the length of the vector. And that's called the space-time
interval. Let's call that <i>s<sup>2</sup></i>, the space-time
interval.</p>

<p>If it took two events separated in space by <i>Δx</i> and separated
in time by <i>Δt</i>, then we like to use the symbol
<i>Δs<sup>2</sup></i> for the space-time interval. That's the same
thing applied to the differences rather than to the coordinates
themselves. And this is invariant. Invariant is a term mathematicians
use for saying same for all people, or unaffected by Lorentz
transformation. It's the analogue of how far you are from the origin in
the old days, when I took two frames, one which is the standard
<i>xy</i>, the other is the rotated <i>xy</i>. If you go to the rotated
frame, the components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> change, but how far you are
from the origin, or what's the length of the vector is the same for all
people. More generally, the dot product of two vectors is invariant
under rotations, and this is the new dot product. I use the symbol dot
product, but I don't draw arrows, because if I don't draw any arrows
and use capital letters, it means it's a four-vector. That's the
<i>X</i> vector.</p>

<p>Then I said, "Let's try to reason by analogy and try to invent a
momentum vector." How did we invent the momentum vector in the old
days? We said, let the particle move a distance <i>Δr</i>, vector
<i>Δr</i>, in a time <i>Δt</i>, and a divide by <i>Δt</i>, and take
some limit. But I know this is a vector because <i>Δr</i> is a
difference in two vectors. Where the particle is now, and where it is
later, the difference of two vectors is also a tiny vector going from
here to there. Dividing by a scalar, by a scalar I mean something that
is not affected by rotations, means taking a vector and multiplying it
by some number. Therefore, that's also a vector, so this ratio is also
a vector, and the limit of the ratio is also a vector. I'm sorry, I
forgot the mass here, and we call it the momentum vector. So, you can
manufacture vectors starting with a position vector by taking
derivatives with respect to something like time that is the same for
all observers, where observers, I meant in the old days, people with an
axis rotated anyway you like.</p>

<p>I wanted the same thing now in this present problem, but I now want
to define obviously a four-dimensional vector. So, to do the
four-dimensional vector, my plan is to define something called
momentum, which is now going to be the change in this fourth position
divided by something. The question is, "What do I divide it by?" I
cannot divide by <i>Δt</i>. In the old days <i>Δt</i> was a sacred
number, same for all people. Now <i>Δt</i> is like <i>Δx</i> or
<i>Δy</i>, it's one of the components, and you don't divide the change
in the vector components by the change in one of the components to get
a velocity. You've got to divide by something that's going to play the
role of time, and have the same value for all people. Well, we sort of
know what that quantity is. Obviously, if a particle is moving from
here to here in space-time, this is <i>x<sub>0</sub> = ct</i> and this
is <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>. It moves the distance <i>Δx<sub>1</sub></i> in
a time <i>Δt</i>, and we know that for this piece of its motion the
following quantity, <i>Δs</i>, which is [root of] <i>cΔt<sup>2</sup> -
Δx<sup>2</sup></i>, is the same for all people. So, I should really be
dividing by this.</p>

<p>Let me write it slightly differently as <i>cΔt</i> times the square
root of 1 minus <i>Δx</i> over <i>Δt<sup>2</sup></i> times
1/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So, we are asked to divide by this crazy thing.
Well, let me write this crazy thing as <i>c</i> times something I want
to call <i>dτ</i>, is <i>dt</i> times the square root of 1 minus
<i>Δx</i> over <i>Δt<sup>2</sup></i> times 1/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. Then
I said, "We can give a meaning to this thing." In fact, let's take the
derivative with respect to <i>τ</i> not <i>s</i>. They differ only by
this factor <i>c</i>, which is a constant so it doesn't matter.
<i>τ</i> has units of time, and you can ask, "What does that time stand
for?" It's not the time according to me, but I argued that it's the
time according to the particle. Why? Because you can evaluate this
quantity in any frame you like. So, go to the frame moving with the
particle. If you're moving with the particle, and if you're here now
and there later, later is certainly later, but here remains here for
the particle. It doesn't move in its own frame. So, <i>Δx</i> will
vanish, therefore <i>Δs</i> simply reduces to <i>c</i> times the time
elapsed according to the particle. So, <i>dτ</i> is the time elapsed
according to the particle itself. According to the particle. That's
what we're going to divide by.</p>

<p>So, it's a very clever way to circumvent the question of what should
I take the derivative respect to, my time and your time all are
variable, we don't agree on it. But let's ask how much time elapsed
according to the one thing we are studying, and let's divide by that
time. That answer will be the same because you and I may not agree on
how long it took to go from here to there, but we can all ask how long
did the particle say it took to go from here to there. We're talking
about the same thing, and we'll get the same answer. To get the
particle time you've got to take the time according to you and me and
multiply it by this factor. This factor, by the way, is nothing but
usual time dilatation. Because the particle says it took time <i>dτ</i>
because the clock has slowed exactly this amount, I will say it took
longer by this amount.</p>

<p>So, let's rewrite this in a way that's going to be more helpful to
us. Take the ratio and write <i>dt</i> over <i>dτ</i> is 1 over the
square root of 1 minus <i>v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup></i>. I'm going to
use that in a minute. That just says the time according to me and the
time according to the particle are related by the time dilatation
factor that's controlled by the velocity of the particle. Now, we are
ready to define the four-momentum <i>p</i>. The four-momentum <i>p</i>
is going to be <i>m</i> times <i>dx<sub>0</sub>/dτ</i> times
<i>mdx<sub>1</sub>/dτ</i>. I'm not going to bother with the other
components. You can always put them back. But <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> you
remember was <i>ct</i>. So, this really becomes <i>mdt</i> divided by
<i>dτ</i>, <i>mdx</i> divided <i>dτ</i>. This is guaranteed to be a
four-vector. That means, if you know the components of this in one
frame of reference, and you call one of them as <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>,
and you call this one as <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>. Then, in a frame that's
moving relative to your <i>x</i> speed <i>u</i>, our
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> prime will be <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> minus <i>β</i>
times <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> over the square root, and
<i>p<sub>1</sub></i> prime will be <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> minus <i>β</i>
times <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> over the square root. It will transform just
the components of <i>x</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: For <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, where does the <i>c</i>
go?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Where did the <i>c</i> go? No,
it did not go, you're quite right. The <i>c</i>, <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>
the <i>ct</i>, you're quite right. It is <i>c</i> times <i>dt</i>. You
need that; then, this is correct. So, we've got a four-vector, but we
don't know what it means. Because we don't know what <i>dτ</i> means.
Of course it's the time according to the particle, but I don't care
about the particle. I'm studying this particle, I've got my own clock,
I've got my own meter sticks, I want to think in terms of time
according to me. Period. Well, we can do that. We can do that by going
to anything where you take a derivative such as
<i>dx<sub>1</sub>/dτ</i> and you can write is as
<i>dx<sub>1/</sub>dt</i> times <i>dt/dτ</i>. <i>dx<sub>1</sub>dt</i> is
something we understand, it's just the velocity according to you and
me. If you use that rule here, you will find the momentum has got
components <i>m</i> times <i>c</i>, <i>dt/dτ</i> is <i>dt/dt</i>, which
is 1, times <i>dt</i> divided by <i>dτ</i>, which is this factor here.
And the second thing will be <i>mv</i> divided by the same thing. In
other words, you can trade <i>τ</i> derivatives for <i>t</i>
derivatives everywhere, provided you attach this factor. That's the
ratio of the <i>τ</i> derivative to the <i>t</i> derivative.</p>

<p>So, now I have a four-vector. I still don't know what it means, but
at least it is written in terms of things with a direct operational
significance for me. I see a particle moving, it's got a velocity, put
that in and I get this thing. Apparently, the relativity theory says
this should play the role of momentum, but a four dimensional momentum
in your new world. If you want to bring the other components, we'll put
an arrow, you can keep it or leave it; it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Now, notice once again that--Okay, I'll continue some more. I've
already done this last time, but let me remind you. We looked at this
guy and said, "Look, at smaller velocities, when <i>v/c</i> is very
small, the denominator is just 1. Numerator is <i>mv</i>. And then I
said, "Uh-huh, that's the momentum." So, it must be that with all these
factors, this is the momentum in the new relativistic theory. In the
new relativistic theory momentum is not just mass times velocity. Mass
times velocity divided by all this stuff. The theory says, "Use that as
your momentum." That's good. Then, we say, "Okay, that's my momentum,
who is this?" I expanded this out for small velocity. If you put
velocity equal to 0, you get <i>mc</i>. That looks like just the mass
and we don't know what that corresponds to. It's the mass, nothing
kinematical. But if you expand the square root a little further out to
one more term, we found that the 0 component, <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>,
looks like <i>mc</i> times 1 plus <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
2<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> plus dot dot dot. That becomes <i>mc</i> +
1/2<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> times 1 over <i>c</i> plus dot dot dot. And
now I finally have something I understand, because ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> is familiar kinetic energy. But I don't like this
annoying <i>c</i> here. If I multiply both sides by <i>c</i>, I learn
that <i>c</i> times <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> is <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> plus
½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>, plus more stuff that's more and more powers of
<i>v</i> over <i>c</i>. But this I argue. If that's the kinetic energy,
everything is an energy formula, so the whole thing stands for energy.
So, I learned that the first component, of <i>P</i> is energy divided
by <i>c</i>. So, I come back here and I write this as <i>E/c</i>.</p>

<p>So, for all of you, or for many of you who found some of this
mathematics difficult to follow, it depends. For me it was love at
first sight. This is really when I said, "I want to go into business."
For some reason this worked for me. But it doesn't matter. What you
have to know is what I'm going to tell you now. Operationally, I'm not
going to hold you responsible for this part of the material at all. For
me, it's part of explaining how logically starting with the very first
axiom--first two axioms you can deduce everything. But now, I want to
tell you operationally what you guys are supposed to know. You are
supposed to learn the following two things. In the old days, we had
time and we had space; they have been united into a single quantity;
(<i>ct,r</i>), which we write as <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>,
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> etcetera. In other words, the three components of
a vector joined with one quantity that looked like a scalar together to
form a four-dimensional object. Now, we are learning that there is
another four-dimensional object, one of which is just the momentum, and
the other is energy divided by <i>c</i>. And we want to call that as
<i>p<sub>0</sub>,</i> <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> etcetera. Again, the
familiar momentum, which is a vector, joined with another quantity,
which the best way to think about it is kinetic energy, plus rest
energy, plus other corrections. But it's a scalar; it doesn't depend on
orientation of axis in the old days. But now under Lorentz
transformation, namely, when you go from one frame to another, <i>E</i>
and <i>p</i> will all mix with each other just like <i>x</i> and
<i>t</i> will mix with each other, but this is the new four-vector.
It's called the energy-momentum four-vector. Just like that's called
the space-time four-vector. This is the energy-momentum four-vector.
So, all over relativity you will find three objects, which used to be
part of a vector, will combine with the fourth one, which used to be a
scalar; together, they'll form a new four-dimensional vector.</p>

<p>So, we should know the following. When we are studying particle
dynamics, we have to know in more detail--in fact, let me dedicate a
whole board to that, it's very important. The new definition is that
it's <i>E</i> over <i>c</i> and <i>p</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Well, it looks like
<i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> plus ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> plus other stuff,
right? So, I recognize ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> as an energy; then, the
other powers <i>v<sup>4</sup>/c<sup>4</sup></i>, they're all
corrections obviously to the energy at higher velocity. Just like
momentum, even in relativistic theory was not <i>mv</i>. It started out
like <i>mv</i>, but when you expand the denominators and powers to
<i>v/c</i> you get more and more corrections. I identify this as an
energy because if I go to very low velocities, it reduces the rest
mass, which is never going to change, plus a ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>,
which played the role of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>That's why it has units of energy, and one term in it looks like
energy. So, the whole thing, the theory is telling you, it's all just
the energy of the particle. In the old days when velocities were very
small, we saw only that two terms are written: ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>
and <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> we didn't bother with
because it doesn't change in any collision. You add the
<i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> before, each particle has got its own
<i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> before and after; they simply cancel. So, the ½
<i>mv</i> squares before and after that would equal, and we use that to
solve collisions. Now we will be told you should use the conservation
of this energy and the conservation of this momentum in a
collision.</p>

<p>Okay, so the first thing is this is <i>E</i> and this is <i>p</i>,
and if anyone says, "What is <i>E</i>?" It is <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>
divided by 1 minus <i>v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup></i>, and <i>p</i> in
one dimension is <i>mv</i> divided by 1 minus
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. This you must know. So,
momentum and relativity looks a bit like the old momentum but it's got
this ubiquitous factor. And energy looks really weird; doesn't look
like anything on Earth, but if you expand this in powers of <i>v</i>,
you will see the terms we wrote down. Rest energy plus everything else
you can call energy of motion, and the first term of the energy of
motion is the familiar ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. In other words, this is
how the world always was. It was revealed to us in the old days when we
only looked at low energy particles as <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> + ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. And we couldn't see the dot dot dot terms
because <i>v/c</i> was so small, the fourth power and sixth power and
eighth power of <i>v/c</i> were too small for us to detect.</p>

<p>Likewise, the momentum of a particle was never <i>mv</i>; it was
<i>mv</i> divided by all this. But for small values the <i>v/c</i>
looked like that, and they thought, "Hey, that's what is really
happening." So, we were looking at an approximation to these quantities
in the old days when velocities were small, and as velocities go up,
those quantities aren't useful, this is what the theory says should
play the role of the new four-momentum. So, the significance of this
being the forward momentum, first of all is what is written in the top
right corner there; namely, if you know the energy and momentum in one
frame, you can find the energy and momentum in another frame of
reference moving relative to me.</p>

<p>For that purpose, you should take the energy and divide by <i>c</i>,
you should call it <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, the momentum can be left as it
is, and this will behave like <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, that will behave
like <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, under Lorentz transformation. But there are
other consequences of the fact that <i>P</i> is a four-vector. The
first consequence it this: you remember the dot product of a vector
with itself is the same for all observers. So, what's the dot product
of <i>P</i> with itself?</p>

<p>Well, before I do that, let me remind you in general, in relativity
you will have four-vectors: (A) you'll have one part that looks like
time, and one part that looks like an ordinary vector. And (B), is
another four-vector, it's got a part that looks time and another part
that looks like an ordinary vector. It's a union up of former vector
with a former scalar. And they will transform under Lorentz
transformation just like <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>t</i>. But the
following quantity <i>A</i> dot <i>B</i>, which is <i>A<sub>0</sub>
B<sub>0</sub></i> minus the usual dot product of the spatial
components, is invariant. That means all people will agree on this
quantity. And a special case is <i>A</i> dot <i>A</i>, which equals
<i>A<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> minus the length of the vector part,
which for our purpose will be just <i>A<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> -
<i>A<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. This is all reasoning by analogy.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: No. Quaternion are a slightly
different object. You can form with these four numbers something that
you may call a quaternion. Right. They were invented before relativity
by Hamilton, and they are of great mathematical beauty. They're a
generalization of numbers. You know, we generalize real numbers to
complex numbers; then, we went from complex numbers to things called
quaternions. They are also numbers; you can multiply them by each
other, but the product <i>AB</i> differs from the product <i>BA</i>.
They're called hyper-complex numbers where the order in which you
multiply them matters.</p>

<p>Okay. So, now let's ask what is the invariant length square of the
momentum four-vector with itself. That means, you've got to do
<i>p<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - p<sup>2</sup></i>. That means you are
trying to take <i>m<sub>0</sub></i>--I'm sorry, you're going to take
<i>mc</i> over this factor square, minus <i>mv</i> over this factor
square. Well, let's try to do this in our head, guys.
<i>m<sup>2</sup></i> is going to come out of the whole thing, you
agree? On the top, I have got 1 over 1 minus <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, yet I have minus <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over 1
minus <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, so they will all
cancel giving you <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. Uh,
<i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>[Note: Here, the Professor has started dropping the subscript on
<i>m<sub>0</sub>,</i>]. So, the four-vector of any particle has a
length that does not at all depend on how fast it's moving. It depends
only on this.</p>

<p>When you take a velocity vector for a particle, it doesn't have a
fixed length. The particle can be moving slow, it can be moving fast.
So <i>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> + v<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup></i> could
be whatever you like depending on how it's moving. But this
relativistic length square of a four-vector is independent of velocity
because the velocity here when combined with this number just cancels
out. Well, that's just the way it is. Now, if you're not good in
algebra, there's a shortcut for finding this. Let me tell you what the
shortcut is, and we love the shortcuts because they're very helpful.
And the moral of the story is also illustrated by the shortcut.</p>

<p>I want to find <i>P</i> dot <i>P</i>. It's an invariant because it's
like a dot product, so anybody can calculate it. How about somebody
riding with the particle? If you're riding with the particle your 0
component is <i>m<sub>0</sub>c</i>, is <i>mc</i>, there is no velocity
for you, and you have no momentum. As the particle has no momentum as
seen by the particle so the components of the vector <i>P</i> become
<i>mc</i> and 0. What's the length square of this vector? Well, it's
the square of this guy and case closed; there's nothing here to
subtract from here. That's a quick way to verify that this length of
vector with itself is in fact <i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. In
other words, the trick is ride with the particle and calculate the
vector. Then, the vector has only one component, namely <i>mc</i>. It
doesn't have a spatial part because it's not moving according to
itself. That's where <i>P</i> dot <i>P</i> is
<i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So, people write it also as follows:
remember <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> was <i>E</i> over <i>c,</i> this is just
<i>P<sup>2</sup></i> is <i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. This is one
way to write it explicitly, but here is how people write it: multiply
both sides by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> and write <i>E<sup>2</sup></i> is
equal to <i>c<sup>2</sup>p<sup>2</sup></i> <i>-
m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup></i>; that deserves a box. That's how we
remember it. I have just rearranged this equation. <i>P</i> dot
<i>P</i> is <i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. By definition <i>P</i>
dot <i>P</i> is the time-like component square minus the spatial
component square. We agree the time-like part is <i>E/c</i>; the
spatial part is just the momentum. So, I've just rearranged it to get
this. And it says the energy of the particle depends on its momentum,
if it comes complete to rest, you kill this term, that's <i>E =
mc<sup>2</sup></i>; that's the rest energy of a particle.</p>

<p>Now, I am almost finished with the kinematics except for one thing.
There are strange particles in the world called photons. A photon has
no rest mass; therefore, if you naively went by any of these formulas,
if you killed the mass of the photon, you might think energy and
momentum vanish because <i>m</i> is going to 0, but we all know enough
mathematics to know that if it's 0 on the top, you could beat it if
there's a 0 in the bottom. That will occur only for <i>v = c</i>. So,
particles moving at the speed of light do have energy and momentum, but
they don't come from a mass divided by something, or mass times
velocity divided by something. They simply have energy and momentum
that obeys this equation without an <i>m</i> on the right-hand side.
For a photon, <i>E<sup>2</sup></i> equal to (<i>c</i> times
<i>p</i>)<sup>2</sup> is what a photon obeys. So, photons can have
energy, and photons can have momentum, but their energy will be
<i>c</i> times their momentum so that if you find the invariant square
of the photon momentum you will get 0. So, photons are particles whose
momentum square is 0. But the square is the four-dimensional square
with the time square minus the spatial square.</p>

<p>So, let me summarize once more for people who may not want to follow
every detail. The practical part of what you must understand from what
I've been teaching you is that when you study a single material
particle, which has a mass, so that it can be brought to rest and made
to sit on the table, we associate with that at four-vector. The first
part of that is the energy over <i>c</i>; the second part of that is
called the momentum, and the explicit formula for these are
<i>m<sub>0</sub></i>, or <i>mc</i> divided by this and <i>mv</i>
divided by this. And one can explicitly verify that <i>P</i> dot
<i>P</i> is <i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. This is a summary of all
that I've said. If you don't know anything at all, know this. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. A capital <i>P</i> without
any arrows on it is supposed to be a four-vector, and the dot product
of it is defined as the square of the first component minus the square
of the second one. That is correct. And for photons, we always like to
use the symbol <i>K</i> for the momentum of a photon rather than
<i>P</i>. Luckily, people agreed more or less by convention, photon
momentum is called <i>K</i>, and it's called <i>Q</i> by some people,
but we call it <i>K</i>. And the energy of the photon is when we call
<i></i>, the momentum of the photon is going to be called <i>k</i>.
And the condition is <i> = kc</i>. And there's' the condition <i>K</i>
dot <i>K</i> = 0. <i>K<sup>2</sup></i> if you like, shorthand for
<i>K</i> dot <i>K</i>, is 0 for photons. A photon is a particle whose
square of the four-momentum is 0. Material particles that can come to
rest have a square of the fourth momentum, which is
<i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i>. This is something you have to
know.</p>

<p>Another thing you have to know is that when I write them in this
notation as four-vectors, you should know the following: if you know
the components, <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> in one
frame, and you move relative to <i>S</i> with speed <i>u</i>,
<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> prime and <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> prime will be
related to <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> by the Lorentz
transformation. Just like <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> prime and
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime are related to <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>x</i> by that formula on the top left. I'm going to do a lot of
problems for you so you get used to doing relativistic kinematics.</p>

<p>Last thing I want to tell you is why do we take this definition of
momentum. Okay, you agree with the theory naturally gave out something
that it said deserves to be called momentum. But what's so nice about
this? Why is it important that the momentum-energy form a vector? I'm
going to give you a reason for it, and try to follow the reason. The
whole advantage of energy and momentum--What is the big deal about
energy and momentum, let me ask you that. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: They are conserved. They were
not useful unless the special utility came from the fact they're
conserved. So, you can put a restriction on possible collisions. You
add the momentum before, it's got to agree with momentum after. You add
the energy before, it's got to agree with the energy after. Of course,
in relativity, energy and momentum have been assembled into
four-vector, so conservation of momentum will mean really four
equations. The zero part will be the energy before, will be the energy
after, and the three special parts will be <i>x</i> component and
momentum. Before will be <i>x</i> component after and so on. That's all
very good, but you've got to make sure that if a momentum is conserved
for me, forward momentum, it must also be conserved for you. There's no
use having a quantity that's conserved for me and not conserved for
you. So, by the time you bring up something and say, "We're going to
use it as a conserved quantity," you've got to make sure the
conservational law is not limited to one observer. And that's what I
want to show you. I want to argue without writing any questions that if
energy and momentum are conserved for me, they are going to be
conserved for you, because they are vectors.</p>

<p>Let's understand why. Suppose you've got a collision; a lot of
particles come in; one particle brings momentum-energy
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>, other one brings in energy and momentum
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i>. And at the end of the collision maybe they become
particle 3 and particle 4 and particle 5. In relativistic theories, if
two particles come in, you can have 36 particles coming out. In fact,
that's why they built accelerators. If two went in and two came out,
it's a waste of time. You can smash any two things and with that energy
you can produce matter. So, it's not a mistake I've made. I do mean
that sometimes two can go into three, or four or five. Let's take an
example where this is true.</p>

<p>Each <i>P</i> is a four-component object like this. Suppose I say
incoming equals outgoing. Now, if you see the whole collision from your
frame of reference, then I maintain that the numbers you get,
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> prime and <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> prime, will also
equal <i>P<sub>3</sub></i> prime plus <i>P<sub>4</sub></i> prime plus
<i>P<sub>5</sub></i> prime. That's guaranteed, and I want to tell you
why. Suppose these were ordinary vectors, and let me make life simple
by saying that <i>P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub></i> became
<i>P<sub>3</sub></i>. What that means is one vector,
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>, another vector, <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>, added up to
one vector, <i>P<sub>3</sub></i>. Except these are not ordinary arrows,
these are arrows in four dimensions. The fact that two arrows add up to
a third one, are equal to a third one, means they form a triangle. Now,
if they can form a triangle for me, and you can stand on your head and
do what you like, it will still be true. Even though it looks like
this, it is still true that this guy plus this guy is equal to that
guy. If two vectors add up to a third one; namely, if a sum of two
vectors is equal to another vector; namely, the left-hand side vector
is equal to the right-hand side vector, going to a rotated frame will
continue to say that the rotated vector is equal to the rotated vector.
That's because equal vectors upon rotation will remain equal vectors.
That's the whole point. The total incoming momentum four-vector, call
it <i>P</i> incoming, and this is the outgoing momentum, call it the
<i>P</i> outgoing. If <i>P</i> incoming is equal to <i>P</i> outgoing
for me, so two vectors that equal in space-time, for the rotated
observer they will be equal.</p>

<p>Do you understand why? Because my total incoming vector will undergo
Lorentz transformation to become your incoming vector. My outgoing
vector will undergo Lorentz transformation to find your outgoing. But
if the input of the Lorentz transformation is the same, the output will
also be the same because you will be putting the very same numbers to
get out the output numbers. That's why it's very important that this
momentum that we have be used, because it has a chance that if it's
conserved in one frame, it's conserved in all frames. If you went and
said, "You know what? I don't like your formulas. I'm really wedded to
this formula for momentum," what you will find is that even if it's
conserved in your frame of reference, in a different frame of
reference, that combination, sum over <i>mv</i>, will not be conserved.
Okay, that's the final property of four-vectors you've got to use.
Again, if you don't follow the details, you must know that in
collisions that we are going to study we will add up all the
[energy-momentum] four-vectors coming in, we'll equal them to all the
four-vectors going out. That's it.</p>

<p>So, now I'm going to do sample problems to give you a feeling for
that. So, as usual, they will start out with the simplest one and then
try to make it more complicated. So, the first problem is this. I'm
standing here, I've got some mass <i>m</i>, and a photon is coming
towards me with some momentum <i>P</i>. And this hits me on the face
and I absorb the photon. It's completely possible for the atoms forming
the body to absorb a photon. They absorb it; so in the end there is no
photon. There is me, but possibly with a new mass, <i>m</i> prime. In
relativistic collision, there is nothing called inelastic collisions.
Remember the old days when one thing came and stuck to another thing,
and they moved together? Momentum is conserved, but energy is not.
There is no such thing. Energy will always be conserved in relativistic
theories. In other words, even though this will become a single unit,
you might say, "What happened to the energy? Previously, I had a moving
photon, I got nothing moving here." Well, first of all, I will be
moving; secondly, I will have more mass. The best thing is to consider
two particles coming in opposite directions. They collide and form a
new mass. In relativity, there is no momentum in the final particle, it
is not moving at all. But it will be more massive than before, and that
extra mass times <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> will be the extra energy brought
by the particles that are formed.</p>

<p>So anyway, the question here is, "What is <i>m</i> prime?" That's
what we have to figure out. So, the equation we will use is, I will
call my momentum as <i>P</i>. I will call <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> as the
initial one, and <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> as the final one. Let's write
down all the equations we can; the only equation in town is <i>K +
P<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub></i>. Everybody is a four-vector, so don't
be fooled. It's four equations. But in this problem--;luckily, since
there is no motion perpendicular to the <i>x</i> axis, we can have this
<i>x</i> momentum; there's no need for <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>. Because
the photon comes this way, and I can start moving this way, but all the
action is in the <i>x</i> direction. So, here it will be actually
two-dimensional vectors and not four. There's nothing vertically before
or after, it will be 0 = 0. So, what are those equations? Before you do
that, let's write down the momentum of the photon first. Momentum of
the photon has got some energy [should have said <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>]
<i>/c</i>, and it's got some momentum <i>k</i>, where <i> = kc</i>,
you've got to remember that. <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> has got an energy
which is <i>mc</i>, and no spatial momentum because I'm not moving. At
the end of the day <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>, I am moving, but I also have a
new mass, and I have a new velocity, which we don't know, and I have
<i>m</i> prime <i>v</i> divided by the square root of 1 minus
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. Now,all of you should be
able to write this part down. If you're not, you should take a minute,
you should think about it, you can stop me, you can question me. But if
you cannot do this, you cannot do any of the problems. You've got to
think, "Would I have done this? Does it make sense to me?" The
bookkeeping is all in the top. When you've got a material particle,
it's first term, 0 component, will be <i>m</i> times <i>c</i> divided
by the square root of all those things. But if the particle is at rest,
you only have <i>mc</i>. There is no momentum. The final object,
me--After I got hit by the photon, I am recoiling; so, I will have a
velocity. I don't know what it is, but my energy in terms of that, the
first term, <i>p<sub>0</sub></i> will be this; this will be
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, the Law of Conservation of Energy and Momentum, namely
<i>K<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>2</sub> + P<sub>2</sub></i>,
will really be saying all the energy parts of the 0 components will add
up before and after, and the first components will add before and
after. In other words, <i>/c</i> plus <i>mc</i>, will be equal to
<i>m</i> prime <i>c</i> over this. Then, <i>k</i> plus 0 will be equal
to <i>m</i> prime <i>v</i> divided by this. This is not any different
from the old days. You had Law of Conservation of Momentum, you had Law
of Conservation of Energy, except energy is not ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>; energy is this crazy thing. Plus, even if a
particle is not moving, don't forget to give it <i>mc</i> as the
energy; that's the new part. So, what is the question I asked you? I
said, "What is <i>m</i> prime." So, your job is to take these two
simultaneous equations, this one and this one, and solve for <i>m</i>
prime. So, what should I do? Can you think of a strategy that will give
me <i>m</i> prime?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Into this one here? Yes, you
still have to solve for <i>m</i> prime, and you also don't know the
velocity here. Remember, you have to solve for the velocity, and you
have to solve for the <i>m</i> prime. If you say what are the unknowns
and what are the knowns, let's be very clear. The photon has a known
momentum and known energy--that's given to you. Initial me has a mass
<i>m</i>, that's given to you. Your job is to find the unknown mass
<i>m</i> prime, and the unknown velocity. Two equations for two
unknowns, but they're not simple linear equations where you can add and
subtract. The simple linear equations are multiply this by three,
multiply that by four and subtract, and you'll get what you want. But
it's more complicated. The trick that you really want to use is the
fact that for any particle, if you took the square of the 0 component,
subtract from it the square of the spatial component, the answer will
be <i>m</i> prime square <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So, I'm saying: this
square minus this square will be <i>m</i> prime times
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, and that you get by taking the square of this
minus the square of this. You can juggle that, but I'm not going to do
it that way, I'm going to show you a much more efficient and rapid way
to do this.</p>

<p>So, let's do it the more efficient way, so let me come down here so
you can see. Here is a shortcut. The shortcut is to work entirely with
four-vectors and four-dimensional dot products, and don't get down to
the ugly business of writing each component. We know that
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> is <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> plus <i>K</i>, right? And
who are we after? We're after <i>m</i> prime; then we remember that
<i>P<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, namely <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> dot
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> is equal to <i>m</i> prime square
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. Yes? So, the question you are asked is--No one
asked you how fast I am moving after I got hit by the photon; you're
only asking me what is my new rest mass. See, I've swallowed a photon,
so I weigh more; it's really that. How much more do I weigh is the
question; namely; what is my rest mass. Namely, I swallowed it, and I
recoiled, and if you travel with me and find me at rest, what mass
<i>m</i> prime will you measure? So, no one's asking me my velocity of
recoil <i>v</i>. So, you shouldn't bother to calculate that. You could
if you wanted to, but no one is asking you that. So, go directly for
<i>P<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. So, the quantity we're looking for is
<i>m</i> prime square <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. That's got to be
<i>P<sub>1</sub> + K</i>, the whole thing square. Well, do the old
algebra. That's equal to <i>P<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
K<sup>2</sup></i> plus twice <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> dot <i>K</i>. Okay,
now let's see if I can do what we do next. Would you like to guess?
Yes? No? Do we know any of these quantities? Do we know anything about
the three terms I've written here? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: <i>K<sup>2</sup></i> = 0 because
of what?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: For a photon I told--For any
particle the square root of its momentum is really the square root of
its mass times <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. For photons, I told you long back,
<i>K</i> dot <i>K</i> is 0. You don't have to worry about that. How
about the square of the momentum of me? Well, that was my rest mass
before, times <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> plus 0. Now, <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>
dot <i>K</i> you've got to be careful. That dot product means--let me
write down the vector of <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>K</i> for you.
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> was <i>mc</i> and 0, and <i>K</i> was
<i></i>/<i>c</i>, and the spatial momentum, where <i></i> was equal
to <i>kc</i>. Remember that? For a photon, once you pick the energy,
you have no choice with the momentum. The magnitude of the momentum has
to be the magnitude of energy divided by <i>c</i>. So, let's take
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> dot <i>K</i>; let's try to do <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>
dot <i>K</i>. Remember the dot product of two vectors is time times
time. <i>mc</i> times <i></i> over <i>c</i> minus space dot space,
that was 0. So, I cancel that, and I find it's really <i>m</i>. And
that's equal to <b>m</b> prime <b>c<sup>2</sup></b>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Can you just remind me what the <i></i> stands for
again?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yeah, the photon, remember the
four-vector's first component is energy over <i>c</i>. Second component
is the momentum. It's traditional to call the energy of the photon by
the symbol <i>Ω</i>. And it's traditional to call the momentum of the
photon, the usual momentum, by the symbol <i>K</i>. And that's very
helpful; otherwise, you're going to have <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> sub-0 and
<i>K<sub>1</sub></i> sub-0, too many indices. So, what we're trying to
do is whenever we write a <i>K</i> whose components are <i></i> and
little <i>k</i>, we know we're talking about a photon. And whenever I
write a <i>P</i>, I know I'm talking about the electron. So, <i></i>
is just the energy of the photon. So now, if I cancel all the <i>c</i>
squares, then I get <i>m</i> prime square plus <i>m<sup>2</sup></i>
plus 2<i>m</i>/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. Now, you can take the square
root, if you like, and that's the answer.</p>

<p>So, my mass would have gone up. You might think, "How much would the
mass have gone up?" First of all, this guy swallowed a photon of energy
<i></i>, so maybe that energy over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> will be the
change in mass. That is not correct, and you've got to think about why
that is not the answer. Why is that wrong? Why doesn't the photon
energy turn into my extra mass? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: In other words, when I absorb
the photon, I also have to recoil to conserve the momentum of the
photon. Consequently, my final energy will equal old energy plus photon
energy, but that does not mean all of it is rest energy because there's
some energy of motion. So, you've got to make sure that in the end you
calculate it so that the total energy is balanced, but it's not
contained in rest mass. Because you produce the [extra] rest mass, and
you also move the rest mass. And for all of that you've got only the
energy of the photon to work with.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is one problem. I was going to do one or two more, but
I want to make sure you guys are following; I just don't know. See, if
I ask you what you would do next, if you have some idea, then we can
proceed, but if you don't know, maybe we should slow down. And you've
got to talk about which part of it you find more difficult. So, let me
say a few things. And the first time you hear something that you find
difficult, you've got to put your hand up, okay? Otherwise, you're not
going to make progress. The first thing I say is this: particles of
mass have an energy and momentum that depend on their velocity and rest
mass as given by the first equation. And the energy and momentum are
assembled into a four-vector, the first component of which is
<i>E/c</i>, the second component is just the momentum. That much you
should know. Secondly, if you took the dot product of that vector with
itself, and the dot product is defined to be Lorentz invariant, so that
it is the same for all people, that's <i>p<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> -
p<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, you'll always get
<i>m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup></i> for any particle of mass independent
of its state of motion. And the simplest way to remember that is to
evaluate the dot product in the frame moving with the particle. In that
frame, it only has a <i>p<sub>0</sub></i>, which is <i>mc</i>, and
doesn't have a spatial momentum; so that's got to be the answer.</p>

<p>Second thing, when you deal with photons, they're a little tricky.
Photons have energy, photons have momentum, but energy is not mass
times some velocity square over 2 etcetera. They have no mass, but they
have energy and they have momentum, and the condition of the photon is
that the energy must be momentum times <i>c</i>. That will make sure
that <i>K</i> dot <i>K</i> is 0. Because for a particle of mass
<i>m</i>, I showed you the relation, <i>E<sup>2</sup></i> = (<i>c</i>
times <i>P</i>)<sup>2</sup> + <i>m<sup>2</sup> c<sup>4</sup></i>. For a
photon, there is no <i>m</i>. That means <i>E = pc</i>. So, photon
energy and photon momentum have relative magnitude. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: That's what I'm telling you. For
a photon, it's not defined as <i>mv</i> over something. It is not
defined that way because you don't even get off first base because
<i>m</i> vanishes, and <i>v</i> = 0, you're in real trouble. So, you've
got to realize that for a photon there's an exception of how you think
about it. You don't think of it as an object of some mass that moves
and has some energy and some momentum. It always moves at one speed.
You might say, if it always moves at one speed, it must have only one
unique momentum. That's not true either. So, they are a little tricky.
For photons, you have to accept the fact that photons have energy and
photons have momentum, with <i>E = pc</i>. And apart form that, there
is no restriction, you can give a photon any energy you like as long as
the momentum you give it is such that <i>E<sup>2</sup> =
c<sup>2</sup>p<sup>2</sup></i>. And you cannot go to the frame in which
the photon is at rest; there is no such thing, it has no rest mass. But
particles with no rest mass can have energy, and can have momentum.
When enough photons hit you, you can feel the force, that's called
radiation pressure. So, they carry momentum, they carry energy, but the
formula for momentum energy is not written in terms of mass. So, that's
the second thing I've said. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: For the photon? Yes.
<i>k<sub>0</sub> = k<sub>1</sub></i> for the photon. And if I wrote
<i>k<sub>0</sub></i> as <i>/c</i>, then it means <i> = kc</i>. That's
the second statement. That's not obvious from anything I've taught you.
So, that's some new stuff. Because suddenly, I've got an object with no
mass and the whole derivation for momentum started with <i>m</i> times
some velocity and so on, so that fails for photons. But they exist and
they carry energy, they carry momentum. You should think of them as
particles that obey <i>E<sup>2</sup> = (cp)<sup>2</sup> +
m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup></i>, with <i>m</i> = 0, so they obey <i>E =
pc</i>. That's a second statement.</p>

<p>Third statement is, in a collision you add up all the <i>P</i>s and
the <i>K</i>s for everybody on the left, and that equals the sum of all
the <i>P</i>s and the <i>K</i>s on the right. And you do that so you've
got to make sure you can do that part. For particles, I will tell you
this particle has this rest mass, it's going at this velocity. And you
should be able to build up its energy and momentum. For photons, I
won't tell you this is the velocity, velocity is always <i>c</i>. For
photons, I'll have to tell you this is the <i></i> of the photon; this
is the <i>k</i> of the photon. So, you form a little <i>a</i> vector
with <i></i>/<i>c</i> as the first component, and <i>k</i> as the
second one. Then it's very easy. Add all the first column, second
column, third column, fourth column, and those four things are
separately conserved.</p>

<p>That's it. That's the trick to collisions, balancing energy and
momentum in one mega equation, which is four-momentum before equals
four-momentum after. And the beauty is any observer can look at this
collision from any frame of reference; different people will disagree
on what's the energy and what's the momentum of the particle. For
example, in this example I gave you, I said I am at rest, and I got hit
by a photon, then I'm moving. Well, that's the point of view of some
observers for whom I was at rest initially. You can see the whole thing
from a rocket. In that case, my initial momentum will have a spatial
part because on the rocket, I'll be moving backwards. This photon will
also have a new <i></i> and a new <i>k</i>, which you can find from
Lorentz transformation; this final object will be moving at some speed,
so everything will look different. Nonetheless, the momentum and energy
will balance on the two sides for you as well. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: No. You've got to be very
careful about what you mean by mass. Some people think of mass as
<i>m</i> divided by square root of 1 minus <i>v</i> square root. I
never want to take that point of view. The only mass is the rest mass,
and nobody will disagree on what the rest mass of a particle is. Do you
understand that? I may think the particle is at rest, you may think
it's moving, that's just fine. But if we both ask the following
question, "What is its mass in a frame in which the particle is at
rest?" the answer to that question is a unique answer. To find that,
you go sit with the particle and you find its mass. So, the rest mass,
in this case <i>m</i> and <i>m</i> prime, are the same for all people.
You can see the whole collision on the rocket, the <i>m</i> prime is
the <i>m</i> prime. <i>E</i> and <i>p</i> are transforming as Lorentz
variables, but <i>m</i> is the length squared of a four-vector;
therefore, it's the same for all people.</p>

<p>Now I want to do a second very interesting problem, which is this.
The year is 1953 or '54. You are trying to build a collider in
Berkeley. It's going to have a proton target. By the way, I'm going to
show you one more trick that's very useful. Put <i>c</i> = 1
everywhere. You can always put <i>c</i> = 1 by choice of units. For
example, if your unit of length instead of being a meter stick was 3
times 10<sup>8</sup> meters, and that was your new unit of length,
let's call it a light second. For you, the velocity of light is 1
because it goes 1 light second in 1 second, the distance over time will
be 1. Even if that's not your unit, I say forget about <i>c</i>, do the
math without <i>c</i>; in the end you can always put back the <i>c</i>.
We'll always know in the end how to put back the <i>c</i>. Maybe I have
an example here. Yeah, in this problem, if I've forgotten <i>c</i>
everywhere, I get an answer that looks like this: <i>m</i> prime square
is <i>m<sup>2</sup></i> + 2<i>m</i>. I already know that if that's the
mass square and that's the mass squared. Well, that's the mass, and
that's an energy, so I know that should be a <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> here.
You can always fudge the <i>c<sup>2</sup>;</i> at the end of the day,
there's no reason to carry it from the beginning. Just from dimensional
analysis, when you're looking for energy and you see a mass, put a
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> there. When you're looking for a mass and you see
an energy and it should be a mass, divide by <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So,
that's what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>So, here is a proton at rest. Here is a proton that I've created
from my Bevatron, which is going to come and smash into this. And the
job of this reaction is the following: where this notation is very
unfortunate [<i>p + p</i>], this is not a momentum, this stands for
proton. Proton plus proton should form two protons and a new proton and
anti-proton created from the vacuum. Created from nowhere. This is what
happens in a collider. Particles and anti-particles are created in
pairs using the incoming energy. So, it's the opposite of the atomic
bomb. In an atomic bomb, mass is destroyed and energy is created. In an
accelerator, energy is converted into mass. Which is why two particles
can go in, and four particles, or ten, or 14,000 can come out. We want
to look at the experiment where people were trying to make
anti-protons. The theory says the anti-proton mass is the same as the
proton mass. It's a very general symmetry of the theory. But you want
to make it, and the question is, "What is the minimum energy of this
incoming proton that will make this reaction possible?" And this guy
starts out at rest. So, what energy or what momentum should the
incoming projectile have? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Let's see. So, here are four
protons, and in the cheapest collision what will they be doing in the
end?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Sitting in a clump. And what
will be the energy of that clump?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Do you agree that's
4<i>m</i>?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Okay, this guy brings energy
into the collision, being the static target. So, you would conclude the
energy of this should be 3<i>m</i>. By that we'll mean
<i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> divided by 1 minus <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> should be 3 times <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. That's
the energy. Because that 3<i>m</i> plus this <i>m</i> will make
4<i>m</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: No. The mass of these particles
is always <i>m</i>. I'm saying the energy of this guy is 3<i>m</i>.
Yes? If this is 3<i>m</i> and that guys brings an <i>m</i> just by
sitting there, and we need 4<i>m</i> to make four particles, and we
want the cheapest deal, so nobody is doing anything. But this wrong.
This is an underestimate for what you need. You need more. You've got
to think about why do we need more energy than this? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: No. Let's say they don't
annihilate; they form and they just--they don't annihilate that fast,
so they can be produced. Anti-protons can be produced. That's not the
reason why. I want you to visualize the question we're asking.
Obviously, if we send a super-duper proton beam, it can knock the hell
out of this proton and produce however many particles you want. We want
the minimum energy, and the picture we have is what's the minimum
energy of four particles? Well, it's four particles at rest. That's the
one for which we computed the energy, but there's something wrong with
our argument. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. Let me repeat what he said.
The Law of Conservation of Momentum will not allow you to take a
situation where the proton comes in with momentum. This guy is doing
nothing, and you cannot have four particles at rest, because their
momentum is 0. Therefore, the four guys who are produced must be
drifting forward with some minimum momentum, so that that momentum
equals incoming momentum. That means, you've got to pay the price to
make them, you've got to pay the price to move them at a minimum
momentum to balance the incoming momentum. So, that should tell you
that the real energy of the incoming particle has got to be more than
just whatever I said, 3<i>m</i>. So, we've got to find out the real
momentum.</p>

<p>So, the trick is again going to be the same. So, this is the initial
state, this is the final state, but this final state has got some
motion. It cannot be at rest. So, what's the initial momentum? Initial
momentum for this guy is some energy <i>E</i>; for this guy is some
mass <i>m</i>. And the momentum of this is some number <i>P</i>. And
the momentum of this guy is 0; that's the initial momentum. And that's
got to be equal to the final momentum. Very good. Final momentum you
can write down in detail by taking these four masses, giving them some
velocities, but I'm not going to do any of that. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: This <i>m</i>, this particle has
an energy <i>m</i>. It's really <i>mc</i>. Sorry, it's <i>E/c</i>,
<i>mc</i> and 0. This guy has got <i>E/c</i> and some momentum
<i>P</i>. I've forgotten the <i>c</i>. Remember, we agreed that we're
not going to worry about <i>c</i> in this problem? So, this is just
<i>m</i>. So, this is the initial momentum, that's going to be the
final momentum. That also means initial momentum square is final
momentum squared. If two vectors are equal, the squares are equal. Now,
the final momentum squared, I say we can evaluate not in the lab frame,
but in another frame called the center of mass frame. And here is a
center of mass frame. Suppose you start moving to the right at some
speed, what do you think will happen? Imagine in your head. You move to
the right, this proton will start moving to the left<b>,</b> this
proton will appear slower. Is that clear to you? Pick up your speed
until they're coming in exactly opposite momenta. That's a frame of
reference you can imagine. In that frame, the collision looks rather
different. In that frame, this guy and this guy are approaching each
other with opposite velocities, and therefore equal and opposite
momenta; the total momentum is 0. In that frame, these two guys are
allowed to go into four sitting ducks, because the total momentum is 0.
So, that is the frame of reference called the center of mass frame in
which incoming momentum adds up to 0, so the final particles are
allowed to be at rest if they want to, and the minimum energy
collision, they will be produced at rest, because that's the least
expensive way. So, I found a frame in which this is possible. That's
not the lab frame, that's the fame in which they are moving in opposite
directions. But what's the total momentum in this frame? Total momentum
in this frame, <i>P</i> total, is 4<i>m</i>, 0. Now, no one says the
total momentum in that frame has to be the total momentum in my frame,
but--sorry, say <i>P</i> final. No one says that <i>P</i> final should
be my <i>P</i> final, but the square of that <i>P</i> final is the
square of my <i>P</i> final because the square of any vector is the
same for all observers. So, what is <i>P</i> final square? You guys
should know by now. This dot product of this vector with itself is the
square of this number minus 0. There is nothing here. Therefore, I
argue here, that <i>P</i> initial square is equal to <i>P</i> final
square. That I calculate in the center of mass frame, and I get
16<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Right. Why is the square of the
four-momentum the same in two frames of reference? Anybody answer that?
Why is the momentum not equal, but the square is equal? Why is that?
Because it's a dot product of a vector with itself, and the whole idea
of defining these squares is so that they are the same for all
observers. The whole idea of defining four-vectors is that when you
take the length square of a four-vector defined in this crazy way, 0
component squared minus the first component squared, that's the same
for all people, right? That's the beauty. That's why, if you really
look at the total momentum vector in the lab frame, it looks like this.
And that's got to be the final total momentum too. These numbers are
not--they are both non-0. So, no one says the total momentum vector is
the same. In the center of mass frame it looks like this, but the
square of the vector must be the square of the vector for all
people.</p>

<p>Now, let me finish this and maybe we'll have a discussion. So,
<i>P</i> initial square is 16<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>, so this is the top
most line. Find the square of this vector, is (<i>E +
m)<sup>2</sup></i> - <i>P<sup>2</sup></i> = 16<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>.
Now, so, let's see where to write this; maybe I'll write it here. That
means <i>E<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup> +</i> 2<i>Em - p<sup>2</sup></i>
= 16<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>. But you must know that <i>E<sup>2</sup> -
p<sup>2</sup></i> is an <i>m<sup>2</sup></i>. I'm saying
<i>E<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup></i>, if you banish all
factors of <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So, this <i>E<sup>2</sup> -
p<sup>2</sup></i> is an <i>m<sup>2</sup></i>; there is already an
<i>m<sup>2</sup></i> here, so I get <i>2m<sup>2</sup> +</i> 2<i>Em</i>
= 16<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>. You cancel the 2 and make it
14<i>m<sup>2</sup></i>, and you divide by 2<i>m</i>, you find <i>E</i>
= 7<i>m</i>. By the way, this is posted on the web, on the internets.
So, you guys can read it whenever you like. So, don't worry about this
last detail; I've given you every possible detail here. If you didn't
get every factor, it doesn't matter. What I want you to understand is,
I've also given you the whole argument on how you go to this frame and
that frame. The point is you can answer <i>E</i> = 7<i>m</i>, now we
realize it's time to put back the velocity of light, and everybody
knows, even man and woman on the street, that this should be really
7<i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. If we carried factors of <i>c</i> throughout
the calculation, it would have been very messy, but here is where
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> would have to turn up. So, if you're looking for
an energy and you get a mass, you put back the
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>So, what we are told is, the incoming proton, as it moves, its
energy goes from <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i> to bigger and bigger numbers,
because the denominator of 1 over <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> is vanishing. Wait until the energy is 7 times the
rest energy, and when it's 7 times the rest energy, that's when it's
ready to hit the static proton and produce proton/anti-proton pairs
from nowhere. So, some of the 7<i>m<sup>2</sup></i> is going to give a
momentum to the fragment of the collision, and some is to create them.
And the way we found out the minimum energy is we did energy-momentum
calculation. But the minimum energy configuration is easily imagined in
the center of mass frame, that's the whole point. Not in the lab frame,
the center of mass frame. That's why accelerators, nowadays, are taking
one particle that can move faster and faster and hitting a target they
produce intersecting storage rings where the particles are going in
opposite directions. And every time they meet in the racetrack, they're
allowed to collide. What's the beauty of that? The beauty of that is,
since they come with opposite momenta, the final fragments don't have
to move at all. So, you can make more and more mass. So, don't put your
energy all into one beam and a static target; put them into two
oppositely moving beams. Then, all the energy is available for
producing mass.</p>

<p>All right, so I'll stop now. I think this is a difficult chapter, so
you have to go and read, and you have to talk to each other and try to
do as many problems as you can.</p>
