<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Okay, let's start. I'm going to do some leftover stuff from circuits,
because I didn't finish it last time. So I want you to remember the following
things about a circuit. I'm always thinking of different ways to explain it.
So the things we normally learn is, if you've got some battery here, some
number of volts, let's give it the symbol <i>E</i>, and you have a resistor, we
just say there's a 1.5 volt difference. So you can say this is 0 this is 1.5.
Current goes around and comes back. And we say the work is done, because the
battery is somehow making the current go around. But we look under the hood
and found it's somewhat more complex. It is not done entirely with the
electrostatic force. </p>
<p>The electrostatic
force is due to these charges here, sitting on the plate, but they cannot do
work for a charge that goes round and round. Because if you go round in a full
loop in an electrostatic field, the net work done by the field is 0. That's
because the net work done is the integral of the electrostatic field and
because it's conservative, you'll get 0. Yet when charges go round and round
the circuit, they are doing some work, because the resistor is heating up,
delivering heat. And the hidden secret of course is not the electrostatic
force, but another force inside the battery that's doing the job. </p>
<p>So I gave an analogy
which I think is worth repeating. So here is a ski slope and you start here
and you come down. Let's imagine on the way down you bump into a lot of trees,
that you pretty much come down at 0 speed. Then you stagger back to the foot
of this ski lift. Now that's the end of your skiing. There's nothing else,
because gravity is not going to help you anymore, because gravity is not going
to help you go from here to there. So it's not obviously run by just gravity.
That's when you have the ski lift, which I'm going to portray as a vertical
thing, where you've got a lot of chairs, so you can sit on one of them and you
can ride to the top. So that ski lift exerts a force. </p>
<p>Gravity, which is
acting down here, is also acting down here, and the ski lift, <i>F<sub>ski</sub></i>
and <i>F<sub>gravity</sub>,</i> ski lift cancels gravity here and takes you to
the top. So if you define the analog of an emf, there is no &#8220;electro&#8221; about
this one. Let's just call it emf. As the integral of the forces acting on
this one skier, as he or she goes around the loop, you can write that as the
force due to gravity &#8901; dr and the force due
to the lift--or what did I call it? Hey guys, you know what this was called?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Ski.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Ski. Okay, ski dot dr. this is no good. Gravity does something to you when
you come down and takes it all back when you go up. This guy, the force inside
the ski, has a non-zero line integral, because it's a non-zero force only in
here. The line integral's basically the ski force times the distance. The ski
force is just <i>mg</i>, the magnitude. That times the distance is <i>mgh</i>.
That's why you can say this point is a potential <i>mgh</i> that lifts up to
that. But inside this region, gravity is pointing down and the machine takes
you against gravity and puts you on the top. And that's the non-conservative
force that does the work. So the main point was, electrostatics is
conservative, and yet when a charge goes around and around the loop, the line
integral of the total force is not 0, so it's not entirely driven by
electrostatics, but electrostatic forces are important. Just like gravity's
important here, because gravity's what helps you come down here. The ski lift
is all hidden inside, and then it takes you back up. </p>
<p>So I'm going to draw
the circuit in a way that really indicates the gravitational analogy. So I'm going
to draw it not this way but this way. Here's the top plate and here's the
bottom plate and you may directly visualize the height here to be the
potential. Then there is a wire that has no resistance. It's going to be
flat. Potential doesn't have to be up or down for current to flow down this.
Then here is a resistor. Then there's another little wire, which is pretty
much flat and joins at the bottom. There are charges piled up here, there are
charged piled up here, and they will produce an electrostatic field that will
do something there, but inside, they're bad. Electrostatic field goes down
here. </p>
<p>So if this is the
whole story, you cannot do anything, because maybe if you charged it once, it
will go round and come back here and it's stuck, because it cannot go up.
That's when the tiny little hands of the chemical forces will come and drag the
charge, against this field. That's the <i>F<sub>chemical force</sub></i>. And
it&#39;s the line integral of the chemical force around a closed loop that's called
emf. If you write the chemical force per unit charge, integrate over a closed
loop, that's what we call the emf. But that's very easily computed. That's
what I didn't realize, a much easier way to do the computation. This thing is
just a product of that force times the distance, but in magnitude, that force
precisely cancels the downward electric force, just like the lift cancels the
force of gravity. So the line integral in magnitude is just the electric field
times the distance between the two plates, and that is just the voltage. </p>
<p>Therefore the voltage
difference between this point and this point will be the emf. Now if you don't
want to know the whole details, you can go back to drawing pictures this way,
and if you have a circuit like this, and maybe there's a switch here, you can
be assured that between this point and this point, if you go around and measure
the voltage difference, that will be the emf of the battery. That's all you
really need to know. The way it comes out is that this battery is like a pump
that lifts you up by an electrical height equal to 1.5 volts. The emf is
literally the voltage difference. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>What's the symbol
under <i>F<sub>c</sub></i> in the first?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Charge. Because electric field is the force per unit charge. We should take
whatever force there is and write it as a force per unit charge. </p>
<p>All right, so I
wanted to do some simple problems. This stuff you've done already in high
school, but I want to go over it in view of everything we have learned. So here's
the simplest circuit in the world. You have an emf. There is a resistor and it
comes right back. You want to know what current is flowing in the circuit. So
the logic, there are two equations you write now. One equation is, if you
start at any point on the circuit and you go around a path and you come back to
the same point, the change in voltage should be zero, because voltage is like
height. You can go anywhere you want and you can come back, then the change in
height should add up to zero. If you want, sum of all the change in voltage
should be zero around a closed loop. Second thing is, current is conserved.
These are the only equations you need. Current doesn't disappear. It's
uniform here. So current I comes here, drops through the resistor and comes
out of the other side. So I'm going to write the following equation. I'm
going to start at this point and keep track of all the changes in voltage. </p>
<p>First when I go
around this battery, I told you many times, the change in voltage will be just <i>E</i>.
When I come here, current flows downhill. I know the voltage drop here is <i>RI</i>,
but if I follow it, I'm dropping in potential. It's a skier; it's going
downhill. It's a ski lift where it's going up. And then you come back here to
where you started, the total change must be 0. Now this is pretty trivial.
You probably wrote this without any further thought, but we then just say we
get from that <i>E = IR</i>. Then we're going to do a more complicated
problem, one resistor, second resistor, <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>.
Again, if you apply an emf here, that current is going to go through this guy
and go through that guy, and it's the same current because it has nowhere to
go. So the equation now will be <i>E</i>, which is increased when you go up
here. Then you drop <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> times <i>I</i> + <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>
times <i>I </i>and that equals 0, so current is <i>E</i>/(<i>R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub></i>).
That means if you put two resistors in series, it's equal to a single resistor
equal to their sum. In other words, if these two were enclosed in a black box,
you didn't know what's inside, you've got two leads coming out and someone
says, &quot;Hey, what's inside the black box? What's the resistor
inside?&quot; you will apply voltage, you will measure the current and that
ratio you will call <i>R</i>. <i>E</i>/<i>I </i>= <i>R</i>, but here, you can
see <i>E</i>/<i>I</i> = <i>R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub></i>. So that's the value
you will ascribe to the two guys in series. Now if you put them in parallel--I
think again I'm repeating it, but maybe it's harmless right now--so here is one
resistor, here's the second resistor. This is <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, this is <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>.
This is some <i>E</i>. If you put this inside a black box and someone says,
&quot;Hey, tell me what's inside,&quot; you don't know. It may not be this,
but there'll be some effective resistance. </p>
<p>And we compute that
by saying let a current I leave this battery here, do whatever it wants and
come out of the other side. Inside the box, this current will split into an <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>.
I can call it <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>, but I'm just going to call it <i>I</i> - <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>,
because that's what <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> should be. And it comes out of this
side. So let me say the total current = <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>--I changed my
mind, guys. Sorry. Let me call this <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>. The total current
is <i>I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></i>. But <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>V/R<sub>1</sub></i>
because the voltage <i>V</i> is acting across these two ends. The voltage <i>V</i>
is also acting across those two ends, so it will be <i>V/R<sub>2</sub></i>, and
that's going to be equal to <i>V</i> divided by whatever the resistance inside
the box is, by definition. If you compare the two, you find 1/<i>R</i> is 1/<i>R<sub>1</sub></i>
+ 1/<i>R<sub>2</sub></i>. I mention this just to tell you that it comes from
current conservation, where I used <i>I</i>, is <i>I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></i>.
</p>
<p>We might as well deal
with the two others, one other circuit element, which is the capacitor. So
suppose someone takes two capacitors. This guy is <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>, this
guy is <i>C<sub>2</sub></i>, puts them in a black box and says, &quot;Tell me
what's inside.&quot; So you will take your battery, apply voltage <i>E</i>,
then see how much charge leaves the battery. Then the capacitance will be the
charge that leaves the battery divided by the emf or the voltage. If a charge
comes from here, a charge <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> will go from there and <i>-Q<sub>1</sub>
</i>will go there. <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> will go there and -<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>
will go there. So the <i>Q</i> that's going in will be <i>Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub></i>&#8230;
over <i>E</i>. But <i>Q<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>1 </sub></i>times <i>E</i>. <i>Q<sub>2</sub>
= C<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>E</i>. So divided by <i>E,</i> you'll get <i>C<sub>1
</sub>+ C<sub>2</sub></i>. This will tell you that the two capacitors in
parallel will act like a single capacitor whose value is the sum of the two.
That's actually very easy to understand because here's one capacitor. Here's
another guy. Let me just glue those plates together. It doesn't matter
because they are the same voltage. And you don't need these two wires. You can
just dump that and dump that. Current can just come in this way. You've got a
single capacitor with the area equal to the sum of the two areas. Capacitance
was &#949;<sub>0</sub><i>A</i>/<i>d</i>. They have the same <i>d</i>, but the areas
add up so capacitances add up. </p>
<p>And the final thing
which I don't want to do, because I don't want to move onto more interesting
things, is when you put two capacitors in series, what happens is, you can take
it as a homework problem, that if you put a charge <i>Q</i> on this guy, and a
-<i>Q</i> comes out of the other terminal, these two guys have no choice but to
take -<i>Q</i> and +<i>Q</i>, because these two plates are isolated from the
world. The charge they can have has to be equal and opposite, but -<i>Q</i>
has to balance this, and +<i>Q</i> has to balance that. Now if you use the
fact that the voltage drop on this one + the voltage drop on that one is the
total emf, you will find 1/<i>C</i> = 1/<i>C<sub>1</sub></i><sub> </sub>+ 1/<i>C<sub>2</sub></i>.
</p>
<p>So capacitors and
resistors combine in exactly the opposite way. This is just in series, they're
additive; capacitors in parallel are additive. Whereas for resistance in
parallel, you add their inverse to get the inverse of the total, and capacitors
in series, you add the inverses to get the inverse of the total. </p>
<p>So now I want to do
one slightly more interesting problem. It looks like this. You have a voltage <i>E</i>
here. Then you have a capacitor <i>C </i>and a resistor <i>R</i>, and there's
a little switch which we will close at some point. So we want to know what
will happen here. </p>
<p>Initially you are
told the capacitor's empty, there's no charge on it. Once you close the
switch, you should sort of imagine what will happen. This plate is full of
positive charges. They don't want to be there. And this is full of negative
charges. They don't want to be there. So positive charges would like to go
there, negative would like to come around, but the switch did not allow that.
But now that it's closed, some charges will leave this and some negative
charges will be formed on the other side and they'll come back here. It's very
interesting to note that current doesn't really flow through the capacitor.
Instead what happens is, positive charges come here, and positive charges leave
that plate, leaving behind negative charge. And that current will come here,
that's the current <i>I</i>, and goes back there. </p>
<p>But once the
capacitor begins to charge, it bites the hand that feeds it, because it's then
trying to drive its own current. If you ask this guy, &quot;What do you want
to do?&quot; he'll say, &quot;I want to drive the current that way.&quot; The
capacitor will start opposing the external voltage, and as it charges up more
and more and more, eventually, its voltage will equal the applied voltage and
then the current will stop. And when that's happened, the charge on this
capacitor at the end, I'm going to call it <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>, you'll
see why, will be <i>C</i> times <i>E</i>. Then the current would stop. </p>
<p>So let's understand
in detail what happens to current from the time you close the switch. So you
write down the basic equation which says start here, go around and keep track
of the change in voltage and equate it to 0. So I get a +<i>E</i> when I go
through this battery. When I come from here to here, I drop by an amount <i>Q</i>/<i>C</i>.
Then I drop by an amount <i>RI</i>. Then I'm back to where I started, which
was my 0. That's the equation. </p>
<p>So now you can write
this equation as--now what's the relation between <i>I</i> and <i>Q</i> here?
You should think about it. When we drain the capacitor, remember, I did a
problem earlier on where I only had a capacitor and a resistor. There the
current was &#8722;<i>dQ</i>/<i>dt</i> because as the current flows, the capacitor's
getting drained. Here actually the current is +<i>dQ</i>/<i>dt</i>, so if
you're not careful, you'll get in trouble. It's +<i>dQ/dt</i>, because any
charge that piles up on the capacitor leaves the other plate and goes through
this. So the current flow is the charging of the capacitor so <i>I </i>is in
fact +<i>dQ/dt</i>. Otherwise if<i> I</i> is positive and the current is going
this way, charge is building up on the capacitor. So if you remember that, you
get the equation<i> E</i> <i>= Q</i>/<i>C + R dQ/dt</i>. So that's the
equation you want to solve. </p>
<p>So how do we think of
this equation? We tell ourselves if we wait a long, long time, until the
capacitor is completely loaded, so that it doesn&#39;t allow any more current to
flow, its voltage will equal this one and at that point, <i>dQ/dt </i>will
vanish. And let me call that final charge <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>, because
you will find out it happens only after infinite time. That <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>/C
= emf. So the capacitor is empty to begin with. After infinite time, it's
fully charged, meaning this battery cannot charge it to any higher voltage,
because its voltage is precisely balancing that of this. So let me solve--our
goal is still to find <i>Q</i> as the function of <i>t</i>, starting with this
equation. </p>
<p>So we are going to
write <i>Q</i> as a function of <i>t</i>, as <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>,
which is the asymptotic value + some <i>Q</i> twiddle. You can always write
your answer as 96 + something else, and something else will adjust itself to
make this true. But let's find the equation for <i>Q</i> twiddle. So take this
<i>Q</i>, put that into the equation and see what you get. Left hand side is <i>E</i>.
Right hand side is <i>Q</i>/<i>C</i>, + <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>/<i>C</i> + <i>Q</i>
twiddle/<i>C</i>. And when you take <i>dQ/dt</i>, this is a constant. So this
is just <i>dQ </i>twiddle/<i>dt.</i> But <i>Q</i><sub>infinity</sub>/<i>C </i>is
exactly equal to <i>E</i>, so these terms cancel, and the equation I get is
this combination = 0. Right? This says <i>dQ/dt</i>, <i>dQ</i> twiddle/<i>dt</i>
= -<i>RC</i>--I'm sorry, -<i>Q/RC</i>. <i>Q</i> twiddle/<i>RC</i>. And we
know how to integrate this. We've done it many times. With <i>Q</i> twiddle =
<i>Q</i> twiddle at time 0 times <i>e</i> to the &#8722;<i>t</i>/<i>RC</i>. Now <i>Q</i>
twiddle at time 0 has to be chosen to satisfy the following condition: what is <i>Q</i>
at time 0? You guys know what charge is on the capacitor at time 0? Do you
know?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Sorry, my mind is
elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay. Welcome back here. So what is the charge on the capacitor when I started
everything?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Charge on the
capacitor.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
At the beginning of the experiment.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The charge on the
capacitor should equal the 0.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, where I just started. Anybody know? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> 0?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
0, because I told you the capacitor started out with nothing on it. That's not
a mathematical result. It's a historical fact. You can't begin an experiment
with charge on the capacitor. I told you today that the charge on the
capacitor is 0. So I've got to get 0 at <i>t = 0 </i>and this guy is <i>E/C +
Q </i>twiddle, that's <i>Q </i>twiddle of 0 over C. I'm sorry. <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub>
</i>is <i>EC</i>. Is that right? Yes, <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub> </i>= <i>EC</i>
+ <i>Q</i> twiddle of 0 and that's got to be 0. Therefore <i>Q</i> twiddle of
0 = -<i>EC</i>. That means <i>Q</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub> </i>+ <i>Q
twiddle</i>. That becomes <i>EC</i> times 1 - <i>e<sup>-t/RC</sup></i>. </p>
<p>So if you draw the
graph of this, it will satisfy all the expectations we have. If you draw <i>Q</i>
as a function of time, at <i>t = 0</i>, <i>e</i> to the -0 is 1. 1 cancels the
1, you start with 0 charge. At <i>Q</i> = infinity, this guy is gone. It is <i>EC,</i>
which is just that value. So the charge builds up to that value, but it never
quite reaches the value <i>EC</i>. In other words, the voltage in the
capacitor is never quite equal to that of the battery. There's always some
left over. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Where does the
negative come from?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay. I said <i>Q</i> at time 0 is this guy at times <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>,
which is <i>EC + Q</i> twiddle at time 0. But that had to be equal to 0.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So that's how I got that. This is a trick to solve the equation. See, we all
sort of know how to solve this equation. You may not know how to solve an
equation with an extra term here, so this is a trick for solving that. So this
is the part that's interesting, in the sense that once you write the basic
rules of physics, you get some equations. You've got to solve the equations
and it's no longer up to you to see what happens. The mathematics rules after
that point. And whatever it tells you, you rush out to the lab and see if it's
true. And with the capacitor, whose capacitance you have measured carefully,
and a resistor which you have measured carefully, you put them together, here's
a nice prediction on what will happen as it charges up. </p>
<p>For example, you may
want your capacitor to hold 80 percent of its maximum charge and you may like
to know, &quot;How long should I wait?&quot; If you want it to hold 100 percent
of the maximum charge, it's never going to get done. So pick some number.
They'll tell you, if you want 75 percent, that's how many seconds you wait. So
this is how you're supposed to have interplay between mathematics and physics,
because what happened was, you got into a situation where you have to solve an
equation. So this is a differential equation, but differential equations are
just questions which are opposite of derivatives. You're trying to guess a
function about whose derivative you know something, namely this one. </p>
<p>And it's all guess
work. You keep on guessing and keep on guessing and you make a table of
integrals where people tell you what they guessed, and that big fat table of
integrals, you can turn to. But in easy cases, you can solve it yourself.
Okay, now there's a homework problem I'm going to give you guys, but I'll tell
you what's in store for you. We want to ask ourselves, what happens to the
energetics in this problem. When I started, how much energy did I have, and
where was it? Anybody know? Was there any charge in the capacitor? Nothing.
There's nothing to begin with. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's all in your
battery.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, the battery had some internal energy. That's correct. But now, during
this experiment, once I close the switch, I think of the battery as outside my
universe so it gives me some energy. How much energy did the battery give me
during the whole process? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Equal to the
potential energy stored in the capacitor + the energy dissipated by the
resistor.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. So let me repeat what he said. He said it's got to be = to the energy
stored in the capacitor + the energy dissipated in the resistor. And that's
got to be equal to the work done by the battery. It's like saying, how much
work did the ski lift do? Well, the work done by the ski lift is the work it
takes to carry each person from the bottom to the top, multiplied by the number
of people. That's the work done. In electrical language, that just means the
charge transported from the bottom to the top times the voltage. That means the
total work done by the battery = the emf times <i>I</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>dt</i>
from 0 to infinity. <i>I</i>(<i>t</i>)<i>dt</i> is a charge that flows in a
small time <i>dt</i>, and <i>I</i> is not a constant. In fact, we can find <i>I</i>(<i>t</i>)
by the formula of <i>Q</i>(<i>t</i>). Remember, <i>Q</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>EC</i>
times 1 - <i>E</i> to the &#8722;<i>t/RC.</i> </p>
<p>Then <i>I,</i> which
is <i>dQ/dt</i>, you can calculate is <i>EC</i> divided by <i>RC</i> times <i>e<sup>&#8722;t/RC</sup></i>.
It becomes <i>E/R </i>times <i>e<sup>&#8722;t/RC</sup></i>. So the current falls
exponentially in this form. At <i>t </i>= 0 the current is as if the capacitor
were not even there, because the capacitor's inert at <i>t </i>= 0. It has got
no charge. It's not opposing you. And eventually, the current goes to 0. So
take that formula for the current, put it here and do some integral. You get
some answer. </p>
<p>That's the energy
given by the battery to us. And what have you done with it? You charge the
capacitor to &#189;<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>2C</i>, where <i>Q</i> in the end should
be <i>Q<sub>infinity</sub></i>. The resistor burns power at the rate <i>VI</i>,
which is <i>I<sup>2</sup>R</i>. So you take this <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>, take
this <i>I</i>, square it, do the integral from 0 to infinity, multiply by <i>R</i>.
That is the work done in the resistor, or work dissipated in the resistor. You
should make sure that this energy delivered by the battery = what is stored by
the capacitor + what is dissipated in the resistor. That's your homework.
That just means doing these integrals and making sure everything works out.
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Shouldn't it be
negative, negative <i>t/RC</i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, finally I have a chance. This negative sign is going to cancel that.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Look, don't give up, okay, because just like you thought, I make mistakes too.
So I never mind it when you guys do that. In this case, I'll tell you why I
sort of knew what the answer was. I know the answer's positive because the
current's going to be positive. So if I'd kept the extra - sign, it will mean
the current's going against the battery and I would know that doesn't work.
Quite often, we're allowed to use the sign of the answer, we're allowed to
guess the sign. For example, what's the height of a person? You said the
answer was 6 feet, but I don't know if it's + or -. Well, you should know it's
+. You're talking about the height of a person. What's the depth to which he
sank? Well, there it can be negative. So you should know by context whether
the answer is positive or negative. That's a very useful check as far as signs
go. </p>
<p>Now as far as overall
formulas go, you can always take extreme limits of every answer and see if it's
correct. In the beginning, just when you close the switch, there's the
battery, there's the resistor, the capacitor doesn't oppose you, so you get <i>e/R</i>.
At the end of the day, the capacitor's fully charged, it's neutralizing the
battery by driving the current in the opposite way with equal voltage, so the
current should vanish. These are some tests. </p>
<p>All right, so let's
continue now to the last thing in circuits, which I'm not going to do any more,
but I'll tell you the kind of stuff people throw at you. So here is some guy,
some resistor, branches into two other branches, some other voltage, join it
here. This is <i>E</i>, this is <i>R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub></i>.
This is <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>, let's say. You've done stuff like this before,
but let me remind you the trick. The trick is very ancient. We all know what
the trick is. </p>
<p>First is, you've got
to know how many unknowns there are. If you can say the current here is <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>.
I don't know what <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> is; that's an unknown. The current
flowing through this guy is <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>. The current flowing through
this guy is <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>, but I know that <i>I<sub>3</sub> = I<sub>1</sub>
- I<sub>2</sub></i>. Do you agree? <i>I<sub>1</sub> </i>comes here. If <i>I<sub>2</sub>
</i>goes there, <i>I<sub>1</sub> - I<sub>2</sub> </i>goes there. So I'm
actually solving one of the equations, which is that <i>I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub>
+ I<sub>3</sub></i>. Let's put that into the equation. Then you have to write,
so how many unknowns do I have? I have two unknowns, <i>I<sub>1</sub> </i>and <i>I<sub>2</sub>.</i>
So I have to get two equations for two unknowns, and one equation will be--you
can do many things. You can start here, go around like this and say the change
in voltage is 0. That would tell me <i>E<sub>1</sub> - R<sub>1</sub> I<sub>1</sub>
- R<sub>2</sub> I<sub>2</sub> </i>= 0. </p>
<p>Are you guys with me
now? You drop here, you drop here, then you come back. Then you can take
another loop that goes like this. Then you will say <i>E<sub>1</sub> - R<sub>1</sub>
I<sub>1</sub> - R<sub>3</sub> </i>times <i>I<sub>1</sub> - I<sub>2</sub></i>.
Now let's look here. You keep going the same way, but here you drop by an
amount <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>. Then you've come over here and you come to the
other end and you get 0. Now somebody can say, &quot;Hey, why don't I start
here, go around that loop and say that voltage difference is 0?&quot; I'm
getting the third equation, but there are only two unknowns. So you
math-minded people should sort of know what will happen if I write a third
equation. What do you think will happen?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
What do you mean, nothing will happen?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's not going to
help you get any more.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
In what manner will it prove to be useless?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It will be a
combination of the other two.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. You can deduce the third equation by fiddling with the other two. Maybe
9 times one equation - 6 times the second equation will be the third equation.
Therefore it's not an independent equation. It will always turn out that if you've
got two unknowns, you need two independent equations. If you can get three and
four and five, you will find out they're not telling you anything new, so
that's when you stop. If you don't know that, you may start writing all kinds
of equations. You may think, here's another loop. Here's another guy who
wants to do this. You can do all that, but you'll keep getting the same
stuff. </p>
<p>Okay, now we will
really start new topic: magnetism. Well, you start this because every time you
think you're done with physics, somebody does some experiment and it doesn't
fit what you know, so you've got to make up new stuff. So magnetism you know
was discovered in Ancient Greece, when parents noticed kids are sticking stuff
on the refrigerator using some little black things. So more experiments. I
obviously don't know all the details. But it was discovered in many ways. One
was in little compass needles which told you which way was north. </p>
<p>So I'm going to give
you a string of things that happened that tell you there is something going on
that is not covered by anything I've written down so far in this course, new
phenomena that don't make sense. Here's the simplest one. There's a wire
carrying some current. There's a little charge sitting here. Nothing happens.
Because the wire is electrically neutral, the charge <i>Q </i>doesn't do
anything. Now the charge begins to move at velocity <i>v</i>. Then you
suddenly find the charge attracted to the wire. It starts bending in. That is
not the electrical force, because the electrical force is 0. The wire is
electrically neutral. It doesn't care if the charge is moving or not, so it is
a new force. And if the charge goes this way, the force is repulsive. That's
just one phenomenon you notice. </p>
<p>Another thing you
notice is there are little things called bar magnets. They seem to have a
north and a south. And if you bring it next to another bar magnet, which has
got a north and south, you find they repel and south and north attract. Then
you take this compass needle that people use to find the north direction for
the earth, and you put it somewhere here. You find that it swings, if it's
free to pivot, and points in a certain direction. And if you use that as a
direction of a certain field, you can draw these pictures and you sort of know
what it's going to look like. They look like this. So this means if you put a
compass needle here, the north will point like that. That's what I mean.
That's another phenomenon. Then once you found out about electric currents,
you also found that if you took a coil of wire, then a compass needle somewhere
here began to respond to a magnetic field, which if you plot, seemed to look
like this. It seemed to look just like a magnet with a north pole here and a
south pole here. There are no magnets at all. You just had a coil of wire
carrying the current in a certain direction. It goes like this. Then the
magnetic field lines, which you plot by moving the compass needle, they do
this. So all I'm trying to say is there are several phenomena going on, and
the clue that you get is, why didn't I need this before, and why do I need it
now? What is new in this problem compared to the problems I've solved? Can
you see what's making this problem outside the realm of what we studied?
What's the one feature you notice from electrostatics? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The charges are
moving.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Everything is moving. The wire carries charges which are moving and this
little guy who got attracted or repelled, he's also moving. So magnetism is
caused by moving charges and it's felt by moving charges. They've got to move
to play this game. </p>
<p>So magnetism is
caused by moving charges and it's felt by moving charges, whereas in
electrostatics, we didn't have that motion. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What about
reference frames?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, her question was, how about reference frames, namely moving according to
whom, right? So I will come to that near the end when we do relativity, when I
remind you of some ideas of relativity and see what that has to say about
electricity and magnetism. But you are free, even in the relativistic theory,
to take the view that you are not moving. As long you're an inertial frame,
that means a frame in which Newton's laws are valid, you can apply all the laws
of physics as if you were not moving. I'm just saying for that observer, who's
inertial, it's found that when charges are moving according to him or her, they
produce currents which produce a field, and the charges in that field will also
respond. </p>
<p>Now you can say,
&quot;What's so special about you? I will go to a new frame of
reference,right?&quot;  I'll come back to that later, but I cannot resist
telling you at least the answer to some of the questions. For example, if this
charge is moving at a speed <i>v</i> and I'm completely stymied by this
velocity, because I don't know how to deal with it. There's one way to deal
with it, which is to get on a train that goes at the same velocity as this
charge. Then this charge is at rest and if it still bends towards the wire,
which it will--you agree that if you go on a moving train, a charge attracted
to the wire will continue to be attracted to the wire. You've got to say,
&quot;How come? How do you explain that?&quot; Neutral wire attracting a
charge. Either you can say it's all happening because you're in a moving
train, but relativity tells you, people in a moving train are entitled to the
same laws of physics as people in a non-moving train. Now it's true for
Amtrak. As long as you can get the train to move, you can make the same statement.
So how does a person in a moving train explain it? What do you think happens?
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The wire looks
like it's moving back in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The wire may look as though it's moving backwards, but still, a neutral thing
moving forwards or backwards shouldn't matter, right? A neutral rod, let it
move. Why does it matter? So what do you think happens? First of all, do you
think it will be attracted to the wire, even in the moving train? Yes, no? It
will be attracted, because if I see it moving towards the wire, you can go on a
train, you can go on a plane, you will also see it's moving towards it. Maybe
the rate will be different and so on, but the fact that it's getting closer to
the wire is undeniable. And there's going to be no new physics. You're just
going to rely on good old electromagnetism, because electromagnetism is
supposed to work for everybody. In fact, that's how the relativity--even
though electromagnetism was discovered before relativity, it obeys all the
principles demanded by relativistic theory. So everybody should have the same
laws of motion. So have you found a way out now? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Would the wire
look like a bar magnet?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, because bar magnet means you're going to magnetism, right? So let's say I
don't know any magnetism, because the charge is at rest. A charge at rest
doesn't care if it's near a bar magnet. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> ________ lines.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So what should be happening to the wire, you guys? Tell me? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> If you're moving
and then the charges in the wire are moving, say you're moving at the same
speed as the charges on the wire, it would seem stationary. So it's just like
the point charge being attracted to a bunch of--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. Why is the point charge attracted to a neutral wire? That is my
question. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The wire isn't
neutral, because you're moving along with the negative charges, so they stay
there, but then the positive charges keep--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct. So let me explain what he said. In fact, the answer is, the
wire will not be neutral. So how did that happen? You might say, &quot;Oh,
there's a Lorentz contraction,&quot; meaning the lengths get contracted, but if
the wire is neutral, the positives and negatives all get compressed, it still
should look neutral, but that's not how it is. Remember, in a real conductor
you've got positive charges, which are at rest and negative charges which are
moving in the opposite direction, right? So I do that by taking a rod, which
is positively charged, and I take another rod, which is negatively charged, and
I simply move this rod. That will produce a current. </p>
<p>Now if the wire is
neutral, I think you guys can understand that the density on this, in its own
rest frame, will be different from the density of charges here, because lengths
get contracted. It is a contracted wire that should have the same density as
the positive wire, therefore in reality, the contracted wire, length contracted
with increased density, should match the density of this. But if I go to the
moving frame, what will happen is this guy will freeze, and that guy will move
the opposite way. This guy will stop moving; the other will move the opposite
way. But then you can show--I will do that calculation for you later--that the
densities that previously canceled will no longer cancel, and the wire will
have a net positive charge. The point is, there's a lack of symmetry between
the positive and negative charges, because one of them is moving. In fact, if
you took the simple example where the charges in the wire are moving at the
same speed as this guy--let's imagine positive charges can move--and if they're
moving at the same speed as this guy, if you stop this, you will also stop
those, and they will go the opposite way. But if they go the opposite way,
they will contract, and when they contract, they will no longer be balanced by
this, and the positive charge will be attracted to the negative wire, and not
only attracted. It will be the same force that you will get when you learn
about magnetism. </p>
<p>So I'll do this in
detail, but I'm just telling you that you don't have to worry about which frame
of reference you're in. The laws of physics are guaranteed to work for all
frames of reference in uniform relative motion. So when I say velocity is <i>v</i>,
I mean according to any one observer. That could be you. </p>
<p>So you've got all
this phenomena. Now I'm going to give you the fundamental equations of
magnetostatics, that will explain to you everything I've described so far. So
it will have two parts. The first part will be, what is the force felt by a
charge that's in motion in a magnetic field? The next thing is, how do you
produce a magnetic field? Well, the answer is electric currents. Then you can
ask, how does a current here produce a magnetic field there? What's the analog
of Coulomb's law? Coulomb's law is charges here producing the electric field
there. Magnetism is a current here producing a magnetic field there, so you
will have the second part. </p>
<p>So I'm saying that
this formula, <i>q</i> times <i>E</i> is the electric force. Then there's the
fact that the <i>E </i>here due to this guy is 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup> </i>times the
<i>q</i> here, etc. You need both parts. I'm going to give the two parts.
The second part will come later, but first is, if you have a charged particle
in a magnetic field, what's the force on it? So here's the answer. The total
force of a charge particle <i>q</i> is this guy that we already know, + the
cross product of the velocity with the magnetic field. The direction of the
field is determined by the compass needle. That's how the <i>B</i> is
directed. But if you want, this force is called the Lorentz force. It is not
invented by Lorentz, but he did so many things in this field, it's named after
him. You can take this to be a postulate, the summary of years of experiment,
and you can say, &quot;I want to begin here,&quot; you can begin here. </p>
<p>You're never going to
derive this, but this is an experimental fact. So if I go to a part of the
room and say, &quot;Find the electric field here,&quot; I think you all know
what to do. We've done it many times. Take a coulomb and put it there. Find
the force on it, and that's actually the electric field. If you put 5
coulombs, you divide the force by 5 and that's the electric field. If I tell
you, what's a magnetic field, you can take a coulomb there, but you still have
to find out--by the way, the electric field problem's very easy, because the
direction of the electric field is simply the motion of the charge. In the
magnetic problem, there are lots of directions involved. </p>
<p>There's the velocity
of the charge. There's a magnetic field, there's a magnetic force, and they
form a cross product. <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is the force. So if someone says,
&quot;Which way is <i>B</i> pointing?&quot; you'll have to shoot a few
particles and find out how they bend. If you shot it exactly parallel to <i>B</i>
it won't bend at all. That's the direction of <i>B</i>. If you sent it
perpendicular to <i>B</i>, it will bend the most, because the cross product
will be the biggest. Then you can slowly determine by some experiments what
the value of <i>B</i> is. </p>
<p>So let's do a couple
of simple problems where we just use this part, <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>. But there's
a very important aspect of <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>. Wherever a force acts on a
body, you know force dot velocity is the power or the rate at which work is
done. If you take the electromagnetic force dot velocity, you get q times <i>v</i>
&#8901; <i>E</i> + q times <i>v</i>
&#8901; <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>
and that is 0. So you know why <i>v</i> &#8901;
<i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is 0? It's again a purely mathematical result. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because <i>v</i> cross
<i>B</i>is going to be perpendicular to--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
<i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is orthogonal to both <i>v</i> and to <i>B</i>, so it's
coming out--in this case, if B and v are in the blackboard, <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>
is outside the blackboard. Its dot product with anything in the blackboard is
0. So whenever you have a vector dotting itself cross something else, the
answer is 0. That means the magnetic field is always perpendicular to
the motion of the particle. That means it doesn't do any work, never. Not
just weekends. The magnetic field doesn't do any work. So you can say,
&quot;Who cares about such a thing?&quot; Electric fields do a lot of work.
They speed up particles, they slow down. The kinetic energy of a particle will
never change due to the magnetic field. And yet you will see, even though it's
not able to do anything by itself, it's extremely useful in getting a lot of
things done, like generators and so on. They rely on the magnetic field. So
we'll see that, but at the moment, it's fact. The force is always
perpendicular to the velocity for a magnetic field. </p>
<p>So now we are going
to do one or two simple problems. First problem, let me take the easiest one.
I want to find a way to select from a beam of particles, which are all going
from left to right, those which have a certain velocity. I want a velocity
filter, and I cannot seem them microscopically; they are little guys. But
they're moving, they're all moving like this. Here is how we can make a
velocity filter. You take two parallel plates, charge them up so the electric
field looks like this. This particle q will then bend like this in the
electric field. </p>
<p>Now put a magnetic
field into the paper. Let me make sure I got this right. Yes. Put a magnetic
field into the board that's shown by this symbol. Magnetic field coming out
towards you is shown by dots, and coming away from you--coming towards you is
the dot, and going away from you is the cross. That comes from the arrow. If
you have an arrow, if you look at the arrow from behind, it looks like this,
and if it looks like this, you run like hell. These are the two things. So I
want to show you that <i>B</i> is going into the blackboard. Now what's the
force due to <i>B</i>? Take the cross product--that's what I was trying to do
in my head, make sure I got it right--<i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is turning a
screwdriver from <i>v</i> to <i>B</i>. Let's see, <i>B</i> is into the board, <i>v</i>
x <i>B</i> will be like this. Therefore the total force on a charge will be <b>q</b>
times <i>E</i>, which is downstairs--I mean, pointing down, and <i>v</i>x <i>B</i>
which is pointing up. You can see then for a given value of <i>E</i> and <i>B</i>,
for any randomly chosen velocity, these forces will not cancel. </p>
<p>So some guys may bend
like this, some guys may bend like this, or some guys will go straight through.
They are the ones for whom <i>E</i> = <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> or the magnitude of
the velocity is <i>E</i> divided by <i>B</i>. So only those particles with
that velocity will make it. In other words, imagine this thing is very, very
long. Some things will go hit it there, others may hit it here. If you are
just right, you will make it to the other side, so it's a velocity filter. Now
you should be able to answer the following question without doing long
calculations. The guys hitting the top, are they faster than the desired speed
or slower?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Faster.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Because what? You understand that? If they're going up, the magnetic force is
winning. The magnetic force is the only one who cares about your velocity, so
the velocity is too big. If they're falling down, electric force is winning.
Electric force is a constant, magnetic force is velocity dependent. So the
fast guys go here, slow and the right one comes here. </p>
<p>Here's another
exercise you can do. There is a magnetic field coming out of the blackboard and
it's uniform in density. And I send a particle here with the velocity like
this. What will it do? So <i>B</i> is coming towards me. <i>B</i> is here. <i>v</i>x <i>B</i>is a force in this direction. It will bend; it will go there. </p>
<p>So it's constantly
being applied a force perpendicular to its velocity, so it's like planetary
motion. It will go in a circle. Never speeding up. It's not speeding up,
because the force is always perpendicular to velocity. You don't change the
kinetic energy, but you change the actual direction of motion. So this is the
way to trap a particle. If you want to trap particles, you put them in a
magnetic field, you don't have to touch them. They will not go anywhere.
They'll form an orbit. So let's find out what we can say about this orbit. If
that distance is <i>R</i>, the dynamical equation is <i>mv<sup>2</sup>/R</i>,
is the force you need to bend something into a circle of radius <i>R</i>, if
it's going at speed <i>v</i>. And we can take <i>V</i> to be constant, because
<i>v</i> is not going to change. And that's going to be equal to the magnetic
force, which is <i>v</i> times <i>B</i> times <i>q</i>. </p>
<p>I didn't write the
cross product, because everything is perpendicular to everything. The magnetic
field and v are perpendicular, so the cross product and magnitude is just <i>v </i>times
<i>B</i>. The direction of the force is of course towards the center. If you
balance these two equations, you find <i>v</i>/<i>R</i> is <i>qB</i>/<i>m</i>.
So what is <i>v</i>/<i>R</i>? Let's look at what's <i>v</i> over <i>R</i>. If
the particle has a velocity <i>v</i>, the time period due in orbit will be 2<i>&Pi;R</i>/<i>v</i>.
The distance divided by speed is the time period. So <i>v/R = </i>2<i>&Pi;/T</i>
or 2<i>&Pi;f</i>. That's called the omega or the angular speed. It goes around
and around the circle with an angular speed, &#969;. So <i>v/R</i> = &#969;. So this
fact was known for some time. It's not very hard to find. But do you know who
made a living out of this? </p>
<p>Notice something very
interesting. The angular frequency does not depend on the speed or on the
radius. It just depends on the charge to mass ratio of the particle in a given
magnetic field. So that circle, that circle, they all go around at the same
rate. As long as the particle has a given charge, a given mass, it's in a
given magnetic field, you can launch them in orbits of various velocities, they
will all be in synch. Now do you know who used this? Does it look like
anything, these guys? That person was actually associated with Yale. That
tell you anything? Okay, his name was Lawrence. Do you know what Lawrence
invented? No? Pardon me? He invented the cyclotron. I'll tell you what--in
fact, he had the ideas when he was a young faculty member here, but he didn't
build it here. He went off to Berkeley and he built the cyclotron there. Then
he built bigger and bigger cyclotrons. And I want to tell you what the idea is
behind a cyclotron. </p>
<p>Here's what you want
to do. You want to accelerate particles so you can smash them against other
things. So one thing you can do is you can take a little battery here, connect
it to two plates. This is positive, this is negative. If you release a proton
here, for example, it will fall down the potential. So it will lose a
potential energy, <i>q</i> times <i>V</i>. That will turn into &#189;<i>Mv<sup>2</sup></i>.
And just when it hits the bottom plate, if you have a hole there, it'll go
through the hole and you have a particle accelerator whose output velocity will
be <i>v</i>, given by this equation. But now if you want to accelerate it to a
higher and higher energies, you've got to get bigger and bigger voltage. </p>
<p>So how are we going
to do that? Here's what Lawrence did. So take a magnetic field. In fact,
there are two metallic halves called <i>D</i>s, because of the way they look.
You send a particle here and at the instant you release it, imagine that this
plate is positive and this plate is negative, and the particle is positively
charged. That means the whole plate has one potential, and the other plate has
a negative potential. So this particle will speed up when it comes here. Now
the whole thing is immersed in a magnetic field, which I&#39;m not showing you. So
this guy will bend and come out of this side. Now what will happen to it?
What will it do now? If you don't do anything, what will happen to the
particle now?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It will slow down.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It will slow down, so that's not the accelerator. You&#39;ve got one gain and
immediately lost it. But suppose when it's here, you very cleverly change the
polarity of this? Just when it's leaving this hole and going to the other <i>D</i>,
you change the polarity, so it's falling again. So it picks up a lot of speed
and goes on a bigger spiral. Here is doesn't experience any field, goes around
and comes here. When it comes there, you quietly change it one more time, so
it's always falling downhill. So every time it's ready to cross the gap, you
flip the voltage. How do you do that? You're not going to stand there with
the battery and keep switching the wires, right? So what do you think you do?
</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Alternating
current?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Put an alternating voltage. Take the power supply from your house, 60 cycle a
second, denoted by this symbol, AC voltage, will reverse its polarity
automatically. And the beauty of this process is the following: once it's got
a certain frequency, it will produce a cyclotron orbit whose omega matches that
frequency. Even though the particle is speeding up--here's the whole
point--even though the particle is speeding up and going in bigger circles, the
ratio of the speed to the radius is such that it takes the same time to go
around these semicircles, no matter how big they are, no matter how fast the
particle's moving. It's the fact that <i>v</i> over <i>R</i> does not depend
on <i>R</i>, <i>R </i>on <i>v</i>. So that's the omega that you will take for
this guy. Then it will keep on picking up speed and at the very end, it will
do a few more such things, then it will come shooting out of here. </p>
<p>So you don't need--in
the end, you can get 1 million volts, but you don't have a 1 million volt
battery. You have a 1 volt battery. It gives it a kick a million times. A
million times you cross the midpoint. It's a very clever way to make the
particle accelerate. The Stanford linear accelerator is somewhat different.
There you have a lot of cylinders and charged particles go from one to the
other. But once again, the polarity is reversed, so every time it goes there,
it's constantly falling downhill. It's just this thing taken out and made into
a straight line, that's about two miles long, I think, in Palo Alto. And that
was the machine that discovered a lot of great things, including what's called
the J particle. So the linear accelerator's one, but this is the cyclotron.
So the next question you want to ask is--these are all examples of forces on a
single charge--what's the force on a wire? </p>
<p>Sometimes you do
microscopic experiments with tiny particles. Other times you do macroscopic
experiments with wires carrying current. So I want to look at that problem.
So let's look at the wire carrying current. So here's a piece of wire, and I
want to find just a little segment, which I write as vector <i>dl</i>. There's
some current going here and the whole thing is bathed in a magnetic field <i>B</i>,
which is constant over the tiny segment. We want to know what's the force on
the little segment. There's going to be a force because there are guys moving
in the wire. That's it. Each one feels a <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> force. You've
got to add it up. So if this has got length <i>dl</i>, how many charges am I
talking about? The number of charges is the density of carriers times the
charge of each one. That's the number of charges, per unit volume. If the
cross section of the wire is <i>A</i>, the length is <i>dl</i>, that's how many
charges are involved here. </p>
<p>Do you understand?
This cross section is <i>A</i>. <i>A </i>times <i>dl </i>is the volume of the
cylinder. That times the number per volume times the charge for each guy is the
total charge. And each one of them experiences the force <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>.
Now I'm going to do a little switch here. I'm going to write it as <i>Anev</i>
<i>dl</i> x <i>B</i>. So you see if you follow that. The velocity of the
carriers is along the wire. <i>dl</i> is also along the wire. Therefore
either you can take the magnitude of this vector times the vector <i>v</i>, or
the magnitude of vector <i>v</i> times the <i>dl</i>. It's the same thing.
They're both the vector parallel to either one. But if you write it this way,
if you go back to what we did earlier, this is just the current in the wire.
So we have a nice formula that says the force on a segment of wire carrying
current <i>I</i> is <i>I </i>times <i>dl</i> x <i>B</i>. </p>
<p>So here's an
example. Suppose you've got a magnetic field like this. And I've got a wire.
I don't know where it's coming from, I don't know where it's going. Let's say
it's just carrying a current. And imagine this is in the real vertical plane,
so that there are some weights hanging from it. It's trying to fall down. You
can balance that by applying a force of magnetism to that wire, because the
magnetic force will be <i>dl</i> x <i>B</i>. Let's see, so <i>dl</i> is this
way, <i>B</i> is out of the board, so let me set the current like this. Then <i>dl</i>
is this way, cross <i>B</i>will be a force upwards. There'll be an upward
force of <i>B</i> times the length of the wire times the current. And if
that's equal to the mass of the wire times <i>g</i>, then the wire won't fall
up or down; it will just stay there. So you can hold up a piece of wire by
driving a current through it and putting in a magnetic field. </p>
<p>But here's another
simple homework problem, or some problem you can find in a textbook. This is a
semicircular wire. Now this wire cannot just start and end here because the
current has to come from somewhere and go from somewhere, so maybe it's doing
this. But I'm just focusing on this section. And imagine there is a magnetic
field going like this. I want to find the force on the semicircle. This is
supposed to be a semicircle. </p>
<p>What's the force on
it? So take a portion of the wire here. This is my <i>dl</i>. This is my <i>B</i>.
Take the cross product of <i>dl</i>with <i>B</i>. Can you see which way it
will go? Do the old screwdriver, your favorite thing. Do this. It's coming
out of the blackboard. And what's the force that's coming out of the
blackboard due to the little section = <i>I</i> times <i>dl</i> times <i>B</i>
times the angle between these two. And that will turn out to be a
sine theta. If you want, you can measure theta from here and you can see that <i>dl
</i>is like that, <i>B</i> is like that, and the angle between the horizontal
and the radial is the same as the angle between the perpendicular to the radial
and the perpendicular to the horizontal. So this theta is the same as that
theta. Then you integrate the force, you get <i>I</i>. <i>dl </i>will be just
2<i>&Pi;R</i>, times <i>B</i>. Sorry, <i>dl</i> will be <i>&Pi;R</i> time <i>B</i>,
times integral of sin<i>&#952;</i> <i>d&#952;</i>, which is -cos<i>&#952;</i> from 0 to <i>&Pi;</i>,
that will give you a 2. </p>
<p>So that will be the
force coming out of the blackboard on this section. I should say theta from 0
to &Pi;. I think there's something wrong with this formula. Hold on for a
second, guys. It should not be done this way. <i>dl</i> = <i>Rd&#952;</i>. There's <i>I</i>
times <i>B</i> and <i>Rd&#952;</i> sin<i>&#952;</i> from 0 to &Pi;, and that will give you 2<i>IBR</i>.
Do you understand that the length of the wire, this segment <i>dl</i>, is <i>R</i>
times <i>d&#952;</i>. Theta is measured in radians. Anyway that is a force and this
section tells you how to calculate that force.</p>
<p>All right, the last
thing which I will start but which I will not finish today, and you can try to
look at some good pictures before you come to class next time. There is just no
way I can get this right. So here is a current loop. And the current goes
like this. And it's in a magnetic field like this. The question is, what
happens to it? So you've got to go to the four sides of the loop, in this side
the <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>, your current is going this way. <i>B</i> is going
straight up. <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> will act like this. There the <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>
will act like this. Here it will act like this and here it will act like
this. And this is the normal to the plane, it's the area vector. </p>
<p>So let me draw you a
side view, because that's the only thing I can even try to do. In the side
view, it looks like this. These two edges are getting pulled. This edge that
you can see here is getting pulled out of the board. The other one's getting
pulled away from the board. They just try to distort the loop, but they cancel
each other and they don't do anything. But these two are equal as forces, but
as a torque, they are not equal and opposite, but they're additive. So they
together produce a torque and let's find out what the torque is. The force on
this segment is <i>B</i> times <i>l </i>times <i>I</i>, where <i>l</i> is
this. Let the other dimension be <i>w</i>, which stands for width. This is <i>w</i>
here. Then the torque will be that times <i>w</i>sin<i>&#952;</i>. That is the
torque. But <i>l</i> times <i>w </i>is the area of the loop. <i>B</i> times <i>A</i>
times sin<i>&#952;</i>. </p>
<p>If I represent the
area as a vector, pointing on this direction, then the torque is simply given
by <i>&#956;</i> x <i>B</i>, where <i>&#956;</i> is a vector whose magnitude is equal to
the current in the loop times area. I forgot the <i>I</i>. And this is called
the magnetic moment of the loop. You call it a magnetic moment, because it's
just like a dipole moment. You might remember, if I take a dipole, put it in a
field, the torque on it is <i>p</i> x <i>E</i> and the energy of it is -<i>p</i>&#8901;<i>E</i>. So magnetic loop
looks like a dipole in a magnetic field. In other words, if there were
magnetic charges in nature, which there aren't, then this guy behaves exactly
like a + magnetic charge and a - on the other side of the loop. So if magnetic
charges existed, this would be simply a magnetic dipole, aligning itself with
the magnetic field, but in reality, there are no magnetic poles. But there is
just the loop that behaves like a dipole. And the dipole moment of the loop,
which is the analog of distance times the charge is the current times the
area. So we'll take it from here next time.</p>
