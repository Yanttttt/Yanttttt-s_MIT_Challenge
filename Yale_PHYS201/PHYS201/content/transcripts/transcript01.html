<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> So, I've got to start by telling you the syllabus for this term--not the
detailed one, just the big game plan. The game plan is: we will do
electromagnetic theory. Electromagnetism is a new force that I will introduce
to you and go through all the details. And I will do optics, and optics is
part of electromagnetism. And then near the end we will do quantum mechanics.
Now, quantum mechanics is not like a new force. It's a whole different ball
game. It's not about what forces are acting on this or that object that make
it move, or change its path. The question there is: should we be even thinking
about trajectories? Should we be even thinking about particles going on any
trajectory? Forget about what the right trajectory is. And you will find out
that most of the cherished ideas get destroyed. But the good news is that you
need quantum mechanics only to study very tiny things like atoms or molecules.
Of course the big question is, you know, where do you draw the line? How small
is small? Some people even ask me, &quot;Do you need quantum mechanics to
describe the human brain?&quot; And the answer is, &quot;Yes, if it is small
enough.&quot; So, I've gone to parties where after a few minutes of talking to
a person I'm thinking, &quot;Okay, this person's brain needs a fully quantum
mechanical treatment.&quot; But most of the time everything macroscopic you can
describe the way you do with Newtonian mechanics, electrodynamics. You don't
need quantum theory.</p>
<p>All right, so now
we'll start with the brand new force of electromagnetism. But before doing the
force, I've got to remind you people of certain things I expect you all to
understand about the dynamics between force, and mass, and acceleration that
you must have learned last term. I don't want to take any chances. I'm going
to start by reminding you how we use this famous equation of Newton. So you've
seen this equation, probably, in high school, but it's a lot more subtle than
you think, certainly a lot more subtle than I thought when I first learned it.
So I will tell you what I figured out over these years on different ways to
look at <i>F = ma</i>. In other words, if you have the equation what's it good
for? The only thing anybody knows right away is <i>a</i> stands for
acceleration, and we all know how to measure it. By the way, anytime I write
any symbol on the board you should be able to tell me how you&#39;d measure it,
otherwise you don't know what you're talking about as a physicist. </p>
<p>Acceleration, I think
I won't spend too much time on how you measure it. You should know what
instruments you will need. So I will remind you that if you have a meter
stick, or many meter sticks and clocks you can follow the body as it moves.
You can find its position now, its position later, take the difference, divide
by the time, you get velocity. Then find the velocity now, find the velocity
later, take the difference, divide by time, you've got acceleration. So
acceleration really requires three measurements, two for each velocity, but we
talk of acceleration right now because you can make those three measurements
arbitrarily near each other, and in the limit in which the time difference
between them goes to zero you can talk about the velocity right now and
acceleration right now. But in your car, the needle points at 60 that's your
velocity right now. It's an instantaneous quantity. And if you step on the
gas you feel this push. That's your acceleration right now. That's a property
of that instant. </p>
<p>So we know
acceleration, but the question is can I use the equation to find the mass of
anything. Now, very often when I pose the question the answer given is, you
know, go to a scale, a weighing machine, and find the mass. And as you know,
that's not the correct answer because the weight of an object is related to
being near the earth due to gravity, but the mass of an object is defined
anywhere. So here's one way you can do it. Now you might say, &quot;Well,
take a known force and find the acceleration it produces,&quot; but we haven't
talked about how to measure the force either. All you have is this equation.
The correct thing to do is to buy yourself a spring and go to the Bureau of
Standards and tell them to loan you a block of some material, I forgot what it
is. That's called a kilogram. That is a kilogram by definition. There is no
God-given way to define mass. You pick a random entity and say that's a
kilogram. So that's not right and that's not wrong. That's what a kilogram
is. </p>
<p>So you bring that
kilogram, you hook it up on the spring, and you pull it by some amount, maybe
to that position, and you release it. You notice the acceleration of the 1
kilogram, and the mass of the thing is just one. Then you detach that mass. Then
you ask--Then the person says, &quot;What's the mass of something else?&quot;
I don't know what the something else is. Let's say a potato. And you take the
potato or anything, elephant. Here's a potato. You pull that guy by the same
distance, and you release that, and you find its acceleration. Since you
pulled it by the same amount, the force is the same, whatever it is. We don't
know what it is, but it's the same. Therefore we know the acceleration of 1
kilogram times 1 kilogram is equal to the unknown mass times the acceleration
of the unknown mass. That's how by measuring this you can find what the mass
is. In principle you can find the mass of everything. </p>
<p>So imagine masses of
all objects have been determined by this process. Then you can also use <i>F =
ma</i> to find out what forces are acting on bodies in different situations,
because if you don't know what force is acting on a body you cannot predict
anything. So you can go back to the spring and say, &quot;I want to know what
force the spring exerts when it's pulled by various amounts. Well, you pull it
by some amount <i>x</i>. You attach it to a non-mass and you find the
acceleration, and that's the force. And if you plot it, you'll find <i>F</i>
as a function of <i>x</i> will be roughly a straight line and it will take the
form <i>F = -kx</i>, and that <i>k</i> is called a force constant. So this is
an example of your finding out the left hand side of Newton's law. You've got
to understand the distinction between <i>F = -kx</i> and <i>F = ma</i>. What's
the difference? This says if you know the force I can tell you the
acceleration, but it's your job to go find out every time what forces might be
acting on a body. If it's connected to a spring, and you pull the spring and
it exerts a force, someone's got to make this measurement to find out what the
force will be. </p>
<p>All right, so that's
one kind of force. Another force that you can find is if you're near the
surface of the earth, if you drop something, it seems to accelerate towards the
ground, and everything accelerates by the same amount <i>g</i>. Well,
according to Newton's laws if anything is going to accelerate, it's because
there's a force on it. The force on any mass <i>m</i> must be <i>mg</i>,
because if I divide by <i>m</i> I've got to get <i>g</i>. So the force on
masses near the earth is <i>mg</i>. That's another force. Something
interesting about that force is that unlike the spring force where the spring
is touching the mass, you can see it's pulling it, or when I push this chair
you can see I'm doing it, the pull of gravity is a bit strange, because there
is no real contact between the earth and the object that's falling. It was a
great abstraction to believe that things can reach out and pull things which
are not touching them, and gravity was the first formally described force where
that was true. And another excursion in the same theme is if this object gets
very far, say like the moon over there, then the force is not given by <i>mg</i>,
but the force is given by this law of gravitation. For <i>e</i>very r near the
surface of the earth, if you put <i>r</i> equal to the surface of the earth you
will get a constant force that is just <i>mg</i>, but if you move far from the
center of the earth you've got to take that into account, and that's what
Newton did and realized the force goes like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. </p>
<p>So every time things
accelerate you've got to find the reason, and that reason is the force. Many
times many forces can be acting on a body, and if you put all the forces that
are acting on a body and that explains the acceleration, you're done, but
sometimes it won't. That's when you have a new force. And the final
application of <i>F = ma</i> is this one. If you knew the force, for example,
on a planet, and here's a planet going around the sun and it is here. This is
the sun, and you know the force acting on it given by Newton's Law of Gravity
you can find the acceleration that will help you find out where it will be one
second later, and you repeat the calculation, you will get the trajectory. So <i>F
= ma</i> is good for three things, that's what I want you to understand: to
define mass, to calculate forces acting on bodies by seeing how they
accelerate, and finally to find the acceleration of bodies given the forces.
This is the cycle of Newtonian dynamics. </p>
<p>And what I'm going to
do now is to add one more new force, because I'm going to find out that there
is another force not listed here. I'm going to demonstrate to you that new
force, okay? Here's my demonstration. The only demonstration you will see in
my class, because everything else I've tried generally failed, but this one
always works. So, I have here a piece of paper, okay? Then I take this trusty
comb and I comb the part of my head that's suited for this experiment, then I
bring it next to this, and you see I'm able to lift that. Now, that's not the
force of gravity because gravity doesn't care if you comb your hair or not,
okay? And also when I shake it, it falls down. </p>
<p>So you're thinking,
&quot;Okay, maybe there is a new force but it doesn't look awfully strong
because it's not able to even overcome gravity, because it eventually yielded
to gravity and fell down,&quot; but it's actually a mistake to think so. In
fact this new force that I'm talking about is 10 to the power of 40 stronger
than gravitational force. I will tell you by what metric I came up with that
number, but it's an enormously strong force. You've got to understand why I
say it is such a strong force when, when I shook it the thing fell down. So
the reason is that if you look at this experiment, here's the comb and here's
the paper, the comb is trying to pull the paper, but what is trying to pull it
down? What is trying to pull it down? So here is me, here is that comb,
here's the paper. The entire planet is pulling it down: Himalayas pulling it
down, Pacific Ocean, pulling it down, Bin Laden sitting in his cave pulling it
down. Everything is pulling it down, okay? I am one of these people generally
convinced the world is acting against me, but this time I'm right. Everything
is acting against me, and I'm able to triumph against all of that with this
tiny comb. And that is how you compare the electric force with the
gravitational force. It takes the entire planet to compensate whatever tiny
force I create between the comb and the piece of paper. To really get a number
out of this I'll have to do a little more, but I just want to point out to you
this is a new force much stronger than gravitation. </p>
<p>So I want to tell you
a few other experiments people did without going into what the explanation is
right now, but let me just tell you if you go through history what all did
people do. So one experiment you can do: You take a piece of glass and you rub
it on some animal that's passing by, water buffalo. That's why I cannot do all
the experiments in class. You rub it on that guy, then you do it to a second
piece of glass, and you find out that they repel each other, meaning if you put
them next to each other they tend to fly apart. Then you take a piece of hard
rubber and you rub that on something else. I forgot what, silk, Yeti, some
other thing. Then you put that here. So I'll give a different shape to that
thing. That's the rubber stick. And you find when you do that to this, these
two attract each other. Sometimes they repel, sometimes they attract. Here's
another thing you can do: Buy some nylon thread. You hang a small metallic
sphere, and you bring one of these rods next to it. It doesn't matter which
one. Initially they're attracted and suddenly when you touch it and you remove
it, they start repelling each other. What's going on? That's another thing
you could do. Last thing I want to mention is if you took two of these things
which are repelling each other, let's say. Let's say they're attracting each
other like this. Then you connect them with a piece of nylon and you take it
away, nothing happens. If you connect them with a piece of wire and take away
the wire, they no longer attract each other. </p>
<p>So these are examples
of different things. I'm just going to say, you do this, you do this, you do
that, then finally you need a theory that explains everything. So that's the
theory that I'm going to give you now. That's the theory of electrostatics.
And I don't have time to go into the entire history of how people arrived at
this final formula, so I'm just going to tell you one formula that really will
explain everything that I've described so far, and that formula is called
Coulomb's Law. Even though Mr. Coulomb's name is on it, he was not the first
one to formulate parts of the law, but he gave the final and direct
verification of Coulomb's Law that other people who had contributed. So
Coulomb's Law says that certain entities have a property called charge. You
have charge or you don't have charge, but if you have charge the charge that
you have, you meaning any of these objects, is measured in coulombs. Remember,
that was not Coulomb's idea to call it coulomb. Whenever you make a discovery,
you're breathlessly waiting that somebody will name it after you, but it's not
in good taste to name to after yourself, but it carries Coulomb's name. </p>
<p>So he didn't say call
it coulomb, okay, but he certainly wrote down this law. The law says that if
you've got one entity which has some amount of charge called <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>,
and there's another entity that has some amount of charge <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>
they will exert a force on each other which is given by <i>q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i>
times this constant which is somehow written as 1 over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>. That's 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
But <i>r</i> is the distance between them, and you can ask in this picture,
what do you mean by distance? I mean, is it from here to there, or is it from
center to center? We're assuming here that the distance between them is much
bigger than the individual sizes. For example, you say, how far am I from Los
Angeles, well, 3,225 miles, but you can say are you taking about your right
hand or your left hand? Well, I'm a point particle for this purpose so it
doesn't matter. So here we're assuming that either they're mathematically
point charges or they're real charges with a finite size but separated by a
distance much bigger than the size, so <i>r</i> could stand, if you like, for
center to center. It doesn't matter too much. So this is what Coulomb said. </p>
<p>Now, if you look at
this number here, 1 over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>, its value is 9 times 10 to the 9<sup>th</sup>.
What that means is the following: If you take one body with 1 coulomb of
charge, another body with 1 coulomb of charge and they're separated by 1 meter,
then the force between them will be this number, because everything else is a
1. It'll be 9 times 10 to the 9 newtons. That's an enormous force, and
normally you don't run into 1 coulomb of charge, but the reason why a coulomb was
picked is sort of historical and it has to do with currents and so on. But
anyway, this is the definition. But if you want to be more precise, I should
write a formula more carefully because force is a vector. Also I should say
force on whom and due to what. So let's say there are two charges, and say <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>
is sitting at the origin and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> is sitting at a point whose
position is the vector <i>r</i>. Then the force on 2 due to 1 is given by <i>q<sub>2</sub>q<sub>1</sub></i>
over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0 </sub></i>times 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
That's the magnitude of the force, but I want to suggest that the force is such
that <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> pushes <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> away. </p>
<p>So I want to make
this into a vector, but I've got the magnitude of the vector. As you know, to
make a real vector you take its magnitude and multiply it by a vector of unit
length in that same direction. The unit vector we can write in many ways. One
is just to say <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>is a
standard name for a vector of length 1 in the direction of <i>r</i>. But I'll
give you another choice. You can also write it as <i>r</i> divided by the
length of <i>r</i>. That also would be a vector of unit length parallel to <i>r</i>.
So there are many ways to write the thing that makes it a vector. And <i>F<sub>21</sub></i>
is minus of <i>F<sub>12</sub></i>. Now, how do we get attraction and how do we
get repulsion? We get it because <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>,
if they're both positive and you if you use the formula, you'll find they repel
each other, but if they're of opposite signs, you'll do the same calculation,
but you'll put a minus sign in front of the whole thing. That'll turn
repulsion into an attraction. So you must allow for the possibility that <i>q</i>
can be of either sign; <i>q</i> can also be 0. There are certain entities
which don't have any electric charge, so if you put them next to a million
coulombs nothing happens. So some things have plus charge. Some things have
minus charge. Some things have no charge, but they're all contained in this
Coulomb's Law. </p>
<p>Now, again, skipping
all the intermediate discoveries, I want to tell you a couple of things we know
about charge. First thing is: <i>q</i> is conserved. Conserved is a physics
terms for saying--does not change with time. For example, when you say energy
is conserved, it means particles can come and collide and do all kinds of
things, but if you add that energy before, you'll get the same answer
afterwards, and whenever that happens, the quantity is conserved. The claim is
electrical charge is conserved. So electrical charge may migrate from A to B
or B to A, but if you add up the total charge, say the chemical reaction of any
process, including in big particle accelerators where things collide and all
kinds of stuff comes flying out, the charge of the final products always equal
to the charge of the incoming products. </p>
<p>But charge
conservation needs to be amended with one extra term, extra qualification.
It's called local. Suppose I say the number of students in the class is
conserved? That means you count them any time, you've got to get the same
number. Well, here's one possibility. Suddenly one of you guys disappears and
appears here at the same instant. That's also consistent with conservation of
student number because the number didn't change. What disappeared there,
appeared here. But that is not a local conservation of charge because it
disappears in one part of the world and appears in another one. And it's not
even a meaningful law to have in the presence of relativity. Can any of you
guys think of why that might be true, why a charge disappearing somewhere and
appearing somewhere else cannot be a very profound principle? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Well, if it's in the
same instant disappearing from one place and appearing another place, it's
traveling faster than light?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Well, we don't know that it was the same thing that even traveled. It may not
have traveled. It may even be--Here's another thing. Suppose an electron,
suppose a proton disappears there and a positron appears here. That still
conserves charge, but we don't think that the proton traveled and became the
positron, right? So it is not that it has traveled. You are right. I hadn't
thought about that. It's a good point that it implies it traveled infinitely
fast, but that's not the reason you object to it. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's not necessarily
simultaneous.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That is the correct answer. The answer is it is not simultaneous in every
frame of reference. You must know from the special theory that if two events
are simultaneous in one frame of reference, if you see those same two events in
a moving train, or plane, or anything they will not be simultaneous.
Therefore, in any other frame of reference, either the charge would have been
created first and then after a period of time reappeared somewhere, I mean,
destroyed somewhere and appeared after a delay, or the appearance could take
place before the destruction, so suddenly you've got two charges. So
conservation of charge, which is conserved non-locally, cannot have a
significance except in one frame of reference, but if you believe that all
observers are equivalent and you want to write down laws that make sense for
everybody it can only be local. So electrical charge is conserved and it is
local, locally conserved. In other words, stuff doesn't just disappear. Stuff
just moves around. You can keep track of it, and if you add it up you get the
same number. </p>
<p>The second part of <i>q</i>,
which is not necessary for any of these older phenomena, is that <i>q</i> is
quantized. That means the electrical charge that we run into does not take a
continuum of possible values. For example, the length of any object, you might
think at least in classical mechanics, is any number you like. It's a
continuous variable, but electric charge is not continuous. As far as we can
tell, all the charges we have ever seen are all multiples of a certain basic
unit of charge, which turns out to be 1.6 times 10 to the -19 coulombs. Every
charge is either that or some multiple of it. Multiple could be plus or minus
multiple. So charge is granular, not continuous. </p>
<p>Okay, so I'm going to
give you a little more knowledge we have had since the time of Coulomb that
sort or explains these things. I mean, what's really going on
microscopically? We don't have to pretend we don't know. We do, so we might
as well use that information from now on. What we do know is that everything
is made up of atoms, and that if you look into the atom it's got a nucleus, a
lot of guys sitting here. Some are called protons and some are called
neutrons, and then there are some guys running around called electrons. Of
course we will see at the end of the semester that this picture is wrong, but
it is good enough for this purpose. It's certainly true that there are charges
in an atom which are near the center and other light charges which are near the
periphery, are outside. All things carrying electric charge in our world in
daily life are either protons or electrons. You can produce strange particles
in an accelerator. They would also carry some charge which would in fact be a
multiple of this charge, but they don't live very long. So the stable things
that you and I are made of and just about everything in this room is made of,
is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. The charge of the neutron, as
you can guess, is 0. The charge of the electron, by some strange convention,
was given this minus sign by Franklin. And the charge of the proton is plus
1.6 times into -19 coulombs. </p>
<p>There are a lot of
amazing things I find here. I don't know if you've thought about it. The
first interesting thing is that every electron anywhere in the universe has
exactly the same charge. It also has exactly the same mass. Now, you might
say, &quot;Look, that's a tautology,&quot; because if it wasn't the same charge
and if it wasn't the same mass you would call it something else. But what
makes it a non-empty statement is that there are many, many, many, many
electrons which are absolutely identical. Look, you try to manufacture two
cars. The chance that they're identical is 0, right? I got one of those cars
so I know that. It doesn't work. It's supposed to. So despite all the best
efforts people make, things are not identical. </p>
<p>But at the
microscopic level of electrons and protons, every proton anywhere in the
universe is identical. And they can be manufactured in a collision in another
part of the universe. This can be manufactured in a collision in Geneva, the
stuff that comes out identical. That is a mystery, at least in classical
mechanics it's a mystery. Quantum Field Theory gives you an answer to at least
why all electrons are identical, and why all protons are identical. The fact that
they're absolutely identical particles is very, very important. It also makes
your life easy, because if every particle was different from every other
particle, you cannot make any predictions. We know that the hydrogen atom on a
receding galaxy is identical to the hydrogen atom on the Earth. That's why when
the radiation coming from the atom has a shifted wavelength of frequency, we
attributed to the motion of the galaxy. From the Doppler Shift we find out its
speed. But another explanation could be, well, that's a different hydrogen
atom. Maybe that's why the answer's different. But we all believe it's the
same hydrogen atom, but it's moving away from us. </p>
<p>Therefore, one of the
remarkable things is that all electrons and all protons are equal, but a really
big mystery is why is the charge of the electron exactly equal and opposite the
charge of the proton. They are not the same particle. Their masses are
different. Their other interactions are different. But in terms of electrical
charge these two numbers are absolutely equal as far as anybody knows. That's another
mystery. Two different particles, not related by any manifest family
relationship, have the same charge, except in sign. And there are theories
called Grand Unified Theories which try to explain this, but certainly not part
of any standard established theory, but it's key to everything we see in daily
life because that's what makes the atom electrically neutral. </p>
<p>Okay, now we can
understand the quantization of charge, because charge is carried by these guys
and these guys are either there or not there, so you can only have so many
electrons. We cannot have a part of an electron, or part of a proton. Now,
let's try to understand all these experiments in terms of what we know. First
of all, when you take this piece of glass, and you rub it, the atoms in glass
are neutral. They've got equal number of protons and electrons, but when you
rub it, the glass atom loses some electrons to whatever you rubbed it on.
Therefore, it becomes positively charged, because some negative has been taken
out. In the case of the rubber stick, it gains the electrons and whatever
animal you rubbed it on, it loses the electrons. So actually real charge
transfer takes place only through electrons. Protons carry charge, but you are
never going to rip a proton out unless you use an accelerator. It's really
deeply bound to the nucleus. Electrons are the ones who do all the business of
electricity in daily life. The current flowing in the wire, in the circuit,
it's all the motion of electrons. So from this and Coulomb's Law, can you
understand the attraction between these two? How many people think you can,
from Coulomb's Law, understand the attraction between these two rods? Nobody
thinks you can? Well, why do you think you cannot? You know why?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because they're not
point charges?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, any other reason why Coulomb's Law is not enough? Well, how will we
apply Coulomb's Law to understand the attraction between these two rods? What
will you have to do?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You'd have to apply
it to <i>F = ma</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. Once you got the <i>F,</i> the <i>a</i> will follow, but can you compute
the force between two rods? One of them has got a lot of positive charge. One
of them has a lot of negative charge given Coulomb's Law. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You don't know the
exact quantities of the charges.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You don't know the
exact quantities of the charges.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Suppose I tell you. I tell you how many charges there are. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You don't which
direction the attraction is.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, we do know, because the plus and minus will be drawn towards each other.
Okay, I'll tell you what it is. It's an assumption we all make, but you're not
really supposed to make it. It's not a consequence of any logic. Coulomb's
Law talks about two charges, two point charges. What if there are three charges
in the universe? What is the force this one will experience due to these two?
This is <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>. This is <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. This is <i>q<sub>3</sub></i>.
Coulomb's Law doesn't tell you that. It tells you only two at a time, but we
make an extra assumption called superposition which says that if you want the
force on 3 (should read 1), when there is <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>,
you find the force due to <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> and you find the force due to <i>q<sub>3</sub></i>
and you add them up. The fact that you can add these two vectors is not a
logical requirement. In fact, it's not even true at an extremely accurate
level that the force between two charges is not affected by the presence of a
third one. But it's an excellent approximation, but you must realize it is
something you've got to find to be true experimentally. It's not something you
can say is logical consequence. Logically there is no reason why the
interaction between two entities should not be affected by the presence of a
third one. But it seems to be a very good approximation for what we do, and
that's the reason why eventually we can find the force between an extended
object, another extended object by looking at the force on everyone of these
due to everyone of those and adding all the vectors. </p>
<p>Okay, so superposition
plus Coulomb's Law is what you need. Then you can certainly understand the
attraction. How about the comb and the piece of paper? That's a very
interesting example and it's connected to this one. See, the piece of paper is
electrically neutral. So let me do paper and comb instead of this one. It's
got the same model. Here&#39;s the piece of paper. Here's the comb. The comb is
positively charged. The paper is neutral. So anyway, there's nothing here to
be attracted to this one, but if you bring it close enough, there are equal
amount of positive and negative charges, but what will happen is the negative
charges will migrate near these positive charges from the other end, leaving
positive charges in the back, so that the system will separate into a little
bit of negative closer to the positive, and the leftover positive will be
further away. Therefore, even though it's neutral the attraction of plus for
this minus is stronger than the repulsion of this plus with this plus. That's
called polarization. </p>
<p>So polarization is
when charge separates. Some materials cannot be polarized, in which case no
matter how much you do this with a comb it won't work. Some materials can be
polarized. The piece of paper is an example of what can be polarized. We can
understand that too. And in this example, if you bring a lot of plus charges
here, and you look at what's going on here, the minus guys here will sit here
and the plus will be left over in the back, and then this attraction between
plus and minus is bigger than this repulsion, so it will be attracted to it.
But once it touches it, this rod touches that, then what you have is a lot of
plus charges here. They repel each other. They want to get out. Previously
they couldn't get out. They were stuck on the rod, but now that you've made
contact, some of them will jump to that one. Then when you separate them, you
will have a ball with some plus charges, and you will have a rod with more plus
charges, and they will repel each other. And finally I said if you take two of
these spheres, suppose one was positively charged, one was negatively charged,
they're attracting each other. If you connect them with a nylon wire or a
wooden stick nothing happens, but if you connect them with an electrical wire,
what happens is that the extra negative charges here will go to that side, and
then when you are done they will both become electrically neutral. </p>
<p>Okay, so that's why.
So the point of this one is: electric charges can flow through some materials,
but not other materials. If it can flow through some materials, it's called a
conductor. If it cannot flow through them, it's called an insulator. So real
life you've got both. So when you're changing the light bulb, if you don't
want to get an electric shock you're supposed to stand on a piece of wood before
you stick your finger in, unless you've got other intentions. Then, you will
find that you don't get the shock because the wood doesn't conduct
electricity. But if you stand on a metallic stool, on a metallic floor and put
your hand in the socket, you'll be part of an electrical circuit. The human
body is a good conductor of electricity, but what saves you is that it cannot
go from your feet to the floor. Now, there are also semiconductors, which are
somewhere in between, but in our course either we'll talk about insulators,
which don't conduct electricity, and perfect conductors, which conduct
electricity. </p>
<p>Okay, so a summary of
what I've said so far is that there's a new force in nature. To be part of
that game you have to have charge. If you have no charge, you cannot play that
game. Like neutrons cannot play this game. Nothing's attracted or repelled by
neutrons and neutrons cannot attract or repel anything. So you've got to have
electric charge. It happens to be measured in coulombs. So let me ask you
another question. Suppose I tell you, here is Coulombs Law. Let me just write
the number 1 over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>. How are we going
to test that this law is correct? Okay, I'm giving you a bonus. You don't
have to discover the law. I'm giving you the law. All you have to do is to
verify it, and don't use any other definitions other than this law itself. How
will you know it depends on <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> in
this fashion? How will you know it depends on <i>r</i> in that fashion?
That's what I'm asking you. Can anybody think of some setup, some experiment
you will do? Let me ask an easier question. How will you know it goes like 1
over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Vary the distance
between them, and show that the force falls off.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: </b>Well,
you're right that if you vary the distance between them and show the force
falls like that, but how do you know what the force is? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Could you use a
spring here?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
What was your plan?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Observe
acceleration.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You are right. Both of you are right. You can maybe hold this guy fixed, and
let this go, and see how it accelerates. And if you knew the mass of this guy
then you know the force. Then you can vary the distance to another distance,
maybe half the distance. At half the distance if you get four times the force
you verified 1 over <i>r<sup>2 </sup></i>law. The other one is with the
spring. You can take a spring. Say maybe there are two metals, uncharged
objects, then you dump some charge on this and some charge on that, and then
the spring will expand, and you can see what force the spring expands, exerts,
and see if it is proportional to 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. That's how
Newton deduced the 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i> force law. He found the
acceleration of the apple is 3,600 times the acceleration of the moon
towards the earth, and the moon was 60 times further than the apple, and 60
squared is 3,600. That's how he found 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. Now, he
was very lucky. It could have been 1 over <i>r</i> to the 2.110 or 1.96, but
it happens to be exactly 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. Anyway, that's how we
can find even if it's not 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. If it's 1 over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>,
or 1 over <i>r<sup>4</sup></i>, whatever it is you can find by taking two
charges. </p>
<p>See, we don't have to
know what <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> are. That's what I'm
trying to emphasize here. If all you're trying to see is does it vary like 1
over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, keep everything the same except <i>r</i>. Double
the <i>r</i> and see what happens. And best way is what you said. Watch the
acceleration, and if it falls to one fourth of the value for doubling the distance,
it is 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. All right, suppose I got 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
I want to know it depends on the charges as the first power of <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>
and the first power of <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. So how should we do that? And
don't say put 10 electrons once and then 20 electrons because you cannot see
electrons that well. In the old days people did not even know about electrons,
and yet they managed to test this. So how will you vary the charge in a known
way? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You could have many
identical spheres, and maybe keep touching them to each other.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Ah! Okay, many identical spheres.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> And then put charge
on one and then touch it to the second one and you'll get half as much.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. Let me repeat what she said. First you take many identical
spheres. Well, I not going to even try to draw identical spheres because I
haven't learned how to draw spheres, but let's imagine you've got a whole bunch
of these guys. You put some charge on this. You don't know what it is, okay?
We don't know what <i>q</i> is. We're trying to find out. You don't have to
know what <i>q</i> is. So let this be one of the objects. That's my <i>q</i>.
For the other object, keep a fixed-object containing some other <i>q</i>. This
has got charge <i>q</i>. Don't vary the <i>r</i>. Question is, can you change
<i>q</i> to <i>q</i>/2, and her answer was: if it's got some charge, maybe a
plus, bring it in contact with the second identical sphere. If it really is
identical, you have to agree that when you separate them they must exactly have
half each. That's a symmetry argument. Because for any reason you give me for
why one of them should have more, I will tell you why the other one should have
more. You cannot, so they will split it evenly and therefore charge will split
evenly to <i>q</i>/2 here and <i>q</i>/2 here. Then you can take this and put
it there--you've got <i>q</i>/2. Then you can do other combinations. For
example, you can take this <i>q</i>/2 and connect it to the ground so it
becomes neutral. So this has got 0 again. You can touch that with the <i>q</i>/2
and separate them. Then each will have <i>q</i>/4. So in this way you can
vary the charge in a known way, maybe half of it, double it. I give you some
homework problem where you want to get 5/16 of a coulomb. By enough spheres
you can do that. </p>
<p>Again, what I want
you to notice is that you did not know what <i>q</i> was, but all you knew is
that <i>q</i> went to <i>q</i>/2 when you brought two identical spheres and
separated them. That's how we can find that it depends linearly on <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>.
Of course, it also depends linearly on <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> because it's up to
you to decide who you want to call <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, and who you want to
call <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. Okay, so I want you people to understand all the
time that you should be able to tell me how you measure anything, okay? That's
very, very important. That's why you should think about it. If you think in
those terms you'll also find you're doing all the problems very well. If
you're thinking of pushing symbols and canceling factors of <i>&Pi;</i> you won't get the
feeling for what's happening. So everything you write down you should be able
to measure. If you say, &quot;Oh, I want to measure the force,&quot; you've
got to be sure how you'll measure it, and one way is like you said, find <i>m</i>
times <i>a</i>. If you knew the <i>m</i> you can measure the force. For
everything make sure you can measure it. If I give you a sphere charged with
something, then of course we've got to decide. Suppose I give you a sphere.
It's got some charge, and I want you to find how much charge is on that
sphere. This time I want you to tell me how many coulombs there are. What
will you do? What process will you use? Well, then you have a problem because
you are not able to figure out, but if I tell you here's an object, it is 3
meters long, you can test it because you'll go and bring the meter stick from
the Bureau of Standards and measure it three times. I'm asking you, if I give
you a certain charge and say how much charge is there, by what process can we
calibrate the charges? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Put it in the
vicinity of a reference charge and then measure the acceleration.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct. If you knew one standard charge, somehow or other we knew its
value, then bring the unknown one next to it, put it at a known distance,
right? You know the <i>r</i>. You know the 4<i>&Pi;</i>. You know the <i>&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>. You find the force,
you can find this charge. So all we need to know is how to get a reference
charge, right? So how do I know something has a coulomb? How do I get 1
coulomb of charge just to be sure? You know what you could do, because you
haven't defined yet the reference, so you should think about how will I get a
coulomb charge, or any other charge? So I could take these two spheres that
she talked about, each with the same charge <i>q</i>. We don't know what it
is. I put them at 1 meter distance and I measure the force, namely how hard
should I hold one from running away to the other one. Once I got the force,
the only thing unknown in the equation is <i>q</i> times <i>q</i>. I know <i>r</i>.
I know 1 over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>. I can get <i>q</i>.
So every time you write something think about how you'll measure it, because in
that process you're learning how the physics is done. If you try to avoid that
you'll be just juggling equations, and that doesn't work for you and that
doesn't work for me. Anybody who wants to do good physics should be constantly
paying attention to physical phenomena, and not to the symbols that stand for
physical objects. </p>
<p>All right, so the
final thing I want to do in this connection is to give this number I mentioned,
<i>F<sub>gravity</sub></i> over <i>F<sub>electric</sub></i>. I said gravity is
10 to the -40 times weaker. Well, you have to precise on how you got the
number. See, it's not like selling toothpaste where you can say it is 7.2
times whiter. I don't know how those guys measure whiteness in a unit with two
decimal places, but that's a different game. It's not subject to any rules,
but here you have to say how you got the number. In what context did you make
the comparison? It turns out the answer does depend on what you choose.
There'll be some variations, but those tiny variations are swamped by this
enormous ratio I would get. So what you could do is take any two bodies, and
find the ratio of gravity to electric force. One option is to take two
elementary particles, whichever two you like. So I will take an electron and a
proton, but you can take an electron and a positron, or a proton and a proton.
It doesn't matter. </p>
<p>These two guys
attract each other gravitationally and electrically. So I will write the force
of gravitation, which is <i>G,</i> mass of the proton, mass of the electron,
over <i>r<sup>2 </sup></i>divided by <i>q<sub>electron</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>proton</sub></i>
over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i> times 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
Notice in this experiment, in this calculation, <i>r<sup>2 </sup></i>does not
matter, so you don't have to decide how far you want to keep them, because they
both go like 1 over <i>r<sup>2 </sup>,</i>so you can pick any <i>r</i>. So
whatever you pick is going to cancel and you will be left with this number. A <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>q<sub>2</sub></i> and the 1 over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0 </sub></i>is 9 times 10 to the 9<sup>th</sup>.
So now we put in some numbers. So <i>G</i> is 10 to the -11 with some
pre-factors, maybe 6 in this case. I'm not going to worry about pre-factors.
But the mass of the proton is 10 to the -27 kilograms, the mass of the electron
10 to -30 kilograms. So don't say how come they all have these nice round
numbers. They are not. There are factors like 1 and 2. I'm not putting them
because I'm just counting powers of 10. <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> is 1.6 times 10
to the -19, so two of those <i>q</i>'s is 10 to the -38. Then 9 times 10 to
the 9<sup>th</sup> is roughly 10 to the 10<sup>th</sup>. If you do all of that
you will find this is 10 to the -40, if it is some typical situation that you
took, and you found this ratio of forces. If there are two elementary
particles, which are like the building blocks of matter, and you brought them
to any distance you like you compare the electric attraction to the
gravitational attraction. </p>
<p>So one question is:
if gravity is so weak, how did anyone discover the force of gravity? If all
you had was electrons and protons, you'd have to measure the force between
them. Suppose you knew only about electricity, didn't know about gravitation.
One way to find there is an extra force is to measure the force to an accuracy
good to 40 decimal places, and in the 40th decimal place you find something is
wrong. You fiddle around and figure out the correction comes from <i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>
</i>over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, but that's not how it was done, right? You guys
know that. So how did anyone discover the force of gravity when it's
overwhelmed? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Most things are
neutral?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. Most things are electrically neutral. In other words, electric force,
even though it's very strong, comes with opposite charges. It can occur with a
plus sign or with a minus sign. Therefore, if you take the planet Earth, it's
got lots and lots of charges in every atom, but every atom is neutral. You've
got the moon, ditto, lots and lots of atoms, but they're all neutral. But the
mass of the electron does not cancel the mass of the proton. So mass can never
be hidden, whereas charge can be hidden. Mass never cancels. That's the
reason why, in spite of the incredible amount of electrical forces they're
potentially capable of exerting, they present to each other neutral entities.
Therefore, this remaining force which is not shielded is what you see, and has
a dramatic role in the structure of the universe, force of gravity. But in
most cosmological calculations you can forget mainly the electric force. It's
all gravitational force. That's because electricity can be neutralized. So
you cannot hide gravity. Everything has mass. Even photons which have no mass
have energy. They're also attracted by gravitation. </p>
<p>So gravity cannot be
hidden, and that's the origin of something called dark matter. So how many of
you guys heard about dark matter? Okay? Anyone want to volunteer? Someone
whose name begins with T, anybody's name begins with T and also knows the
answer to this? The trouble is, you people are plagued with one quality which
is not good for being in physics, namely you're modest. So you don't want to
tell me the answer. So I have to give an excuse for whoever gives the answer.
If your seat has a number 142, anybody in seat 142? Maybe they're not even
numbered. Look, anybody with a red piece of clothing knows the answer to
this--go ahead. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. Basically there's no way you can see it, and there's dark matter right
in this room, okay? And there's dark matter everywhere, but the reason, the
way people found out there is dark matter, do you know how that was
determined? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The rotation of
galaxies didn't line up with the matter that was visible, so...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So yes. Maybe one example I can talk is about our own galaxy. So here's our
visible galaxy, okay, the old spiral. Now, if something is orbiting this
galaxy just by using Newtonian gravity, by knowing the velocity of the object
as it goes around, you can calculate how much mass is enclosed by the orbit. That's
a property of gravitation--from the orbit, you can find out how much mass is
enclosed. So what you will find is, if you found something orbiting the center
of the galaxy at that radius, you'll enclose some mass. If you take objects at
bigger and bigger radius, you'll enclose more and more mass, until you find
orbits as big as the galaxy. Then the mass enclosed as a function of radius
should come and stop, because after that the orbit's getting bigger, but not
enclosing any more mass. But what people found, that even after you cross the
nominal size of the galaxy, you still keep picking up mass, and that is the
dark matter halo of our galaxy. So it's dark to everything, but you cannot
escape gravity. That's what I meant to say. You cannot avoid gravitational
force. </p>
<p>So people are trying
to find dark matter. People at Yale are trying to find dark matter. The thing
is, you don't know exactly what it is. It's not any of the usual suspects,
because then they would have interacted very strongly. So you're trying to
find something not knowing exactly what it is. And you've got to build
detectors that will detect something. And you go through it everyday in your
lab, and you're hoping that one of these dark matter particles will collide
with the stuff in your detector, and trigger a reaction. Of course there will
be lots of reactions everyday, but most of them are due to other things.
That's called background. You've got to throw the background out, and whatever
is left has got to be due to dark matter. And again, how do you know it's dark
matter? How do you know it's not something else? Well you can see that if
you're drifting through dark matter in a moving Earth, you will be running into
more of them in the direction of motion and less in the other direction,
because you're running into the wind. So by looking at the direction
dependence, you can try to see if it's dark matter. Anyway, dark matter was
discovered by simple Newtonian gravitation. The particles that form dark
matter are very interesting to particle physicists. There are many candidates
in particle theory, but the origin of the discrepancy came from just doing
Newtonian gravity. </p>
<p>All right, the final
thing today before we break is that there's one variation of Coulomb's Law. By
the way, I do not know your mathematical training and how much math you know,
so you have to be on the lookout, say, if I write something that looks very
alien to you, you've got to go take care of that, in particular, how to do
integrals in maybe more than one dimension. Anyway, what I wanted to discuss
today is the following: we know how to do Coulomb's Law due to any number of
point charges. So if you put another charge <i>q</i> here you want the force
on this guy due to all these. You draw those lines, you take the 1 over <i>r<sup>2
</sup></i>due to that, 1 over <i>r<sup>2 </sup></i>due to that, add all the
vectors. That's very simple. But we will also take problems where the charges
are continuous. So here's an example. Here's a ring of charge. The ring has
some radius. You pick your radius <i>r</i>, and the charge on it is
continuous. It's not discrete, or it could be in real life everything is
discrete, but to a coarse observer it will look like it's continuous. So we
can draw some pictures here, charges all over the ring, and <i>&#955;</i> is the number of
coulombs per meter. Let me see, if you snipped one meter of the wire it'll
have <i>&#955;</i> coulombs in it. And
you want to find the electric force on some other charge <i>q</i> due to this
wire. </p>
<p>So you cannot do a
sum. And you have to do an integral. That's what I'm driving at, and I'm
going to do one integral, then we'll do more complicated ones later. So I want
to find the force on a charge <i>q</i> here. So what I will do is, I will
divide this into segments each of length, say <i>dl</i>. Then I will find the
force of the charge here, <i>dF</i>. I will add the forces due to all the
segments. The force of this segment will be the charge--this segment is so
small, you can treat it as a point charge, and the amount of charge here is <i>&#955;</i> times <i>dl</i>.
That's the <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>. The <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> is the <i>q</i> I
put there. Then there's the 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i>, <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
<i>r<sup>2 </sup></i>will be this distance <i>z</i> times this radius <i>r</i>
will be--maybe I shouldn't call it <i>r</i>. Let me call it capital <i>R</i>,
and it's <i>R<sup>2 </sup></i>plus <i>z<sup>2</sup></i>. That's the distance.
But now that force is a vector that's pointing in that direction, but I know
that the total force is going to point in this direction because for every guy
I find in this side I can find one in the opposite direction pointing that
way. So they will always cancel horizontally. </p>
<p>The only remaining
force will be in the z direction. So I'm going to keep only the component of
the force in the z direction. I denote it by <i>dF</i> in the z direction.
For that, you have to take this force and multiply by cosine of that <i>&#952;</i>. I hope you know
how to find the component of a force in a direction. It's the cosine of the
angle between them. That angle is equal to this angle, and cosine of this is <i>z</i>
divided by <i>R<sup>2 </sup></i>plus <i>z<sup>2 </sup></i>on the root. That is
the <i>dF</i> due to this segment, and the total force in the z direction is
integral of this, and what that integrate. <i>&#955;</i>, <i>q</i>, all these are constant, <i>R</i>,
<i>z</i>, everything is a constant. You have to add all the <i>dl's</i>, if
you add all the <i>dl's</i> you will get the circumference. In other words,
this is going to be <i>&#955;</i><i>qz</i> divided by 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i><i>R<sup>2 </sup></i>plus <i>z<sup>2 </sup></i>to
the 3/2 integral of <i>dl</i>. Integral of <i>dl</i> is just 2<i>&Pi;</i><i>R</i>. In other words,
every one of them is making an equal contribution, so the integrand doesn't
depend on where you are in the circle, so you're just measuring the length of
the circle. That's the answer. The force looks like <i>&#955;</i> times 2<i>&Pi;</i><i>R</i>, what is that? <i>&#955;</i> is the charge per
unit length. That, times the length of the loop, is the charge on the loop.
It's the charge you're putting there divided by 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i> divided by <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>
plus <i>z<sup>2</sup></i> to the 3/2. That's an example of calculating the
force which will be in this direction. Now, once you've done this calculation
you may think maybe I missed a factor of <i>&Pi;</i> or factor of <i>e</i>, something. Can you
think of a way to test this? What test would you like to apply to this
result? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Put the <i>z</i>
equal to 0 and have it in the middle. There should be no forces on it.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. What he said is, if you pick <i>z</i> equal to 0 you're sitting in
the middle of the circle, and you're getting pushed equally from all sides, and
you better not have a force, and that's certainly correct. This vanishes when <i>z</i>
goes to 0. Anything else? Any other test? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You could put it
underneath by negative <i>z</i>. The force should be negative.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, it will point down and be negative. That's correct, but how about the
magnitude of the force itself, rather than just the direction? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> If you go infinitely
far away it should look like a point charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. If you go very, very far, someone's holding a loop, you cannot see that
it's even a loop. It's some tiny spec, and it should produce the field. So
what field should it produce? It should produce the coulomb force <i>q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i>,
or 4<i>&Pi;&#949;</i><i><sub>0</sub></i> times distance
squared. And when <i>z</i> is much, much, much bigger than <i>R</i>, this is
one kilometer, this is two inches. You forget this. You get <i>z<sup>2</sup></i>
to the 3/2 is then <i>z</i> cubed. That means the whole thing here reduces to
1 over <i>z<sup>2</sup></i> and it looks like the force between two point
charges. So I would ask you whenever you do a calculation to test your
result. </p>
<p>Okay, before going
I've got to tell you something about those who come late. I realize that you
guys come from near and far, so when you come late let me give you my
preference for doors, okay? Door number one is that one. That's the least
problematic. Door number two is this one, because in the beginning of the
lecture I'm usually on that side of the board, so you guys can come in. Door
number three is that one where Jude is taking the picture, but do not stand in
front of the camera and contemplate your future. If you do I will make sure
you don't have a future, okay? So don't do that. If you come fashionably late,
never come through that door, maybe this one. In fact if you come through that
door because I have reached this side of the board, you are very, very late, so
I think you should take the day off and start fresh next time, all right?
Okay, thank you. </p>
