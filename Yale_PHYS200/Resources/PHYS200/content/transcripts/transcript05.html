<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Let me go back. I was going to
do a brand new topic but I didn't want to go without making sure
everyone understands the loop-the-loop problem. Because that's one
problem where if you didn't learn Newton's laws and apply them
properly, you just couldn't figure it out, okay? All the other things
we do, you know, blocks sliding down planes, friction, pulleys, you
have an intuitive feeling for that, but this one really is very
non-intuitive right? Here is a trolley at the top of the track. The
forces on the trolley, both gravity and the force of the track, are
both pushing down. And the question is, "Why isn't that falling down?"
Everything is pushing down. Why isn't it falling down? That's the
mystery, so what's the answer you'd give to somebody who says, "Why
isn't it falling down?" Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, so they might say, "Well,
if you say it's falling down, how come it doesn't end up here to the
center of the circle?" Yes, somebody have an answer to that, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, there are no forces in the
horizontal direction; the forces are all--yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's not negligible. There is an
acceleration that's producing a change in velocity. But when we say an
apple has a downward acceleration, you let it go and it falls down;
that's what we think is downward acceleration. Here is something which
is downward acceleration, but it's not falling down. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Force changes the direction of velocity vectors over
time, acceleration times time, it just changes the direction of the
velocity vector.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ok. Yes, I'll take one more
answer, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The downward component and the horizontal component
of the velocities are independent of each other so at the same time
that the cart can be falling down it can be moving so much in one
direction [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Alright. So, let me summarize
all the different answers. First of all, one thing you should remember,
there are no horizontal forces here. The forces are what I've drawn;
that's why you should be very, very careful. Just because something has
a tendency to move to the left doesn't mean there's a force to the
left. That's the whole point of Newton's law, force is connected to
acceleration not to velocity.</p>

<p>So yes, this will have an acceleration, you cannot avoid it. <i>F =
ma</i> will tell you <i>T + mg</i> is <i>ma</i>, and the <i>a</i> that
you want in this problem, if it's moving in a circle, is
<i>mv<sup>2</sup>/R</i>. So, it is accelerating, and the difference
between this one accelerating, let us say--If I go to the loop-the-loop
and I drop an apple, forget the track it's got <i>mg</i> acting, it's
accelerating too. What's the difference between these two? Here, we
start with zero velocity; you accelerate downwards. That means you pick
up a downward velocity. As it accelerates you keep falling down and
picking up more and more speed. The same acceleration's experienced by
the cart also, and a little more because <i>T</i> is also pushing down.
But there the change in velocity over a tiny amount of time is not
added to zero velocity, but to this large velocity it has at that
instant. And the tiny increment in velocity if added this way will
produce a velocity in that direction, and what that really means if you
wait a small amount of time, this thing is going along the new velocity
direction.</p>

<p>So, that's the difference between--So, the acceleration is the same
for a falling apple as for the loop-the-loop cart. But in the apple's
case, it is added to zero initial velocity so the acceleration and the
velocity are the same, namely down. If you have a huge velocity to
which you add a tiny change in velocity, the downward direction you
rotate the velocity vector that just means that as it goes around the
circle, the velocity vector is constantly tangent to the circle.</p>

<p>There's another way in which people understand this. If you are on
the Earth and you are standing, say, on a building and you fire a gun,
it goes like that and it hits the ground because of acceleration due to
gravity. If you fire it a little faster it'll go there. There'll be a
certain speed at which it keeps falling but doesn't get any closer to
the center. That is in fact how you launch a bullet into orbit. So,
what's the first thing you should do when you fire this gun? Move away
because it's going to come back and get you from behind, okay [students
laughing]. Alright that's a very useful lesson. So, you might think,
"Hey I shot it in that direction, it's not my problem." Like everything
else it'll come back and get you when you least expect it. This is how
you have--;So, is this thing falling or not? It is constantly falling
but the Earth is falling under it so it's endless search to come to the
Earth. Whereas if you drop the bullet, it'll just fall and it'll hit
the ground; that's what we always think as drop. Okay, so this is
something I did in a rush, and I didn't want that because this is
really the part of physics which is not intuitive, and I think we all
know what the main point is. The main point is velocity is a vector and
its value can change due to change in direction, not change in
magnitude. Yes sir?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> That negative or that downward change in velocity,
what is that equal to?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, if you wait a certain time
<i>Δt</i>, then the acceleration is <i>v<sup>2</sup>/r</i>, put the
<i>v</i>, put the <i>r</i>, get some number, multiply by the <i>Δt</i>,
1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second. That'll be the change in that time. So,
in that time also the guy would have moved over in the circle a little
bit, just precisely so that at that point your new velocity vector is
tangent to your new location. So this little <i>Δv</i> I drew is not a
fixed number; it depends on how long you want to wait. Calculus says
wait an infinitesimal amount of time, in practice wait
1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second and it'll be fine.</p>

<p>Okay, today there is a very, very important concept I want to
introduce. It's a very robust and powerful concept; it has to do with
energy. It is powerful because after the laws of quantum mechanics were
discovered in the sub atomic world, we basically gave up on many
cherished notions. You know, you must have heard that particles cannot
have a definite position and definite velocity at a given time. They
don't have any trajectories. You see a particle here now, then you see
it there. That's true because they're observed events. What happens in
between? You might think they have a trajectory but they don't. The
forces are not well defined because if you don't know where the guy is,
you don't know what the velocity is, you don't know what the
acceleration is. So most of the ideas of Newtonian mechanics are
basically surrendered, but the notion of energy turns out to be very
robust and survives all the quantum revolution.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a period when people are studying nuclear
reactions and the energy you began with didn't seem to be the energy
you ended up with. So something was missing. So Neils Bohr, father of
the atom said, "Maybe the Law of Conservation of Energy is not valid."
Then Pauli said, "I think I put my money on the Law of Conservation of
Energy. I would postulate that some other tiny particles that you guys
cannot see, that's carrying away all the missing energy." That was a
very radical thing to do in those days when people did not lightly
postulate new particles. Nowadays, if you don't postulate a particle
you don't get your PhD in particle physics [students laugh]. In those
days it was very radical, and the particle was not seen for many, many
years. It was called a neutrino. Nowadays, neutrinos are one of the
most exciting things one could study. There's a lot of mysteries in the
universe connected with neutrinos.</p>

<p>Okay, so energy is a concept you're going to learn. Here's again a
place where I ask you, don't memorize the formulas and start plugging
them in. Try to follow the logic by which you are driven to this
notion, because then it'll be less luggage for you to carry in your
head. And I'll try to make the notion as natural as possible rather
than saying, "This is my definition of energy, this is the definition
of kinetic energy." Let's ask where does all that come from.</p>

<p>How many people have seen kinetic and potential energies in your
past? Okay, if you haven't seen it that's fine, this is not something
you're supposed to know. If you know it and you learned it properly
it'll be helpful, but you don't have know that. You just have to know
what we have done so far. So let's go back and ask a simple question.
When a force acts on a body, what is its main effect? What does it do?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It changes its motion.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Be more precise by it when you
say "changes its motion." What does it mean to change its motion?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It accelerates the object [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, that's from Newton's law;
that means it changes the velocity. So let's for a moment, in fact for
the entire lecture today, go back to one dimension. Then, we will do
the whole business in higher dimensions. In one dimension changing the
velocity simply means speeding up. So bodies are going to speed up and
forces act on them. That we know. We're going to find the relation
between how much speed is accumulated when a force acts on a body;
we're going to derive that.</p>

<p>So, let us take an example where the force is in the <i>x</i>
direction and it is some constant. "Constant" meaning it's not varying
with time; somebody just has to just apply 10 Newtons constantly to a
body. What does that do? That produces an acceleration which is
<i>F/m</i>, right, that's Newton's law. That's a constant acceleration.
So, let's go back to lecture number one. Lecture number one we learned
that if a body has constant acceleration, then the velocity at the end
is the velocity squared at the beginning plus 2 times <i>a</i> times
the distance traveled. That's what we learned long back, this is just
kinematics. In those days we didn't ask, "Why is it having a constant
acceleration?" You were just told, "It's a constant acceleration, just
go ahead." Now that we learned dynamics, we know acceleration has a
cause, namely a certain force. So, I'm going to write here as you can
imagine <i>F/m</i> in the place of <i>a</i>, but I'm going to make one
more cosmetic change in notation. In all these energy formulas, rather
than calling the initial velocity or initial anything with subscript
zero and the final is no subscript, we are going to use a notation
where the final quantities are denoted with a subscript 2, initial
quantities are denoted by a subscript 1. In other words, initially, the
body had a velocity of <i>v<sub>1</sub></i>, and then it had an
acceleration <i>a</i> for a distance <i>d</i>, then the relation
between final initial velocities is this. So let's put that <i>F/m</i>
here and let's put a <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Since we are interested in the effect of the force, we want to see
what the force did to the velocity. What you find here is that if you
want to find the change in the velocity, of course you should take this
guy to the left-hand side, right? Take it to the other side and you
want to isolate the force, so bring <i>m</i>/2 to the left-hand side.
So, do that in your head and what do you get?
<i>m</i>/2<i>V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> -
<i>m</i>/2<i>v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> is <i>F</i> times
<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>This is a very important concept. It says, when the force acts on a
body it changes the velocity, and it depends on how far the force has
been acting, how many meters you've been pushing the object. It's clear
that if you didn't push it at all, then even the forces acting,
velocity hasn't had time to change. So, it seems to depend on how far
the force acted, and the change is not simply in velocity but in
velocity squared. That's what comes out; then, you realize that it's
the most natural thing in the world to give this combination a name
because that's what comes out of this. That combination is called
kinetic energy, and I'm going to call it <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>, meaning
<i>K</i> at the end minus <i>K</i> at the beginning is <i>F</i> times
<i>d</i>. So <i>F</i> times <i>d</i> is denoted by the symbol <i>W</i>,
and that's called the work done by <i>F</i>. That's how we introduce a
notion of a force times distance as the definition of work. This is how
people--you can say, "Why did anyone think of taking the combination
<i>F</i> times <i>d</i>?" Well, this is how it happens. So, you need to
have a unit for this, which is actually Newton meters, but we are tired
of calling everything a Newton meter, so we're going to call it a
joule. So joule or <i>J</i>, is just a shorthand for Newton meters.</p>

<p>Alright, so let us now write down this following expression here.
Δ<i>K</i>, Δ in anything we do is the change in any quantity, it's
called delta of that quantity, Δ<i>K</i> is a change in <i>K</i> is
equal to the <i>F</i> times the distance traveled. Let the distance
traveled be some tiny amount Δ<i>x</i>. This formula is valid even if
<i>d</i> is 1km, as long as force is constant. But I'm saying, let's
focus on a problem, whether the force is constant or not, over a tiny
interval in which the body moves the distance Δx. Then, we find that
the change in kinetic energy is force times Δ<i>x</i>.</p>

<p>Now, what if there are 36 forces acting on the body? Which one
should I use? I'm pulling and you're pushing and…[pause]. It's got to
be the net force because Newton's law connects the net force to the
acceleration. If you and I have a tug of war and we cancel each other
out to zero then there's no acceleration. So, you've got to go back to
the definition; this is very, very important. This <i>F</i> better be
the total force. I should really use a subscript <i>T</i> for total,
but I don't want to do that and we write <i>F = ma</i>; it is
understood <i>F</i> is everything. We'll come back later to the notion
of what happens if <i>F</i> is made up of two parts. So, maybe I'll
just give you a simple example.</p>

<p>Here's a body, right, and I'm pushing it this way and you're pushing
it that way, let's say with equal force. And the body could be at rest
or if the body had initial velocity it'll maintain the initial velocity
because velocity is for free. Then, you can ask, "What does this
theorem say?" This is called a Work Energy Theorem. The Work Energy
Theorem says, "The change in energy is equal to the work done by all
the forces." In this case, there is no change in energy, but there are
two forces at work that cancel. Then, it turns out that it is sensible
to define the work done by me, which is equal to <i>F</i> times the
distance traveled, and the work done by you will be in fact given a
minus sign. So, when do we attach a plus sign and when do we attach a
minus sign? If you go back to the whole derivation, it was understood
that <i>a</i> was a positive quantity. Then everything works. But if
the body is moving to the right, and I'm pushing to the right, then the
work done by me is positive. And if you were pushing to the left and
the body still moved to the right, the work done by you is negative. In
other words, if you get your way, namely, things move the way you're
pushing, the work done by you is positive. If people are pushing you
counter to your will, in the opposite direction to your force, work
done by you is negative.</p>

<p>See, here is a simple example. I have a piece of chalk and I'm
lifting it at constant velocity from the ground. Its kinetic energy is
not changing. That means the total work done on it is zero, but it's
not because there are no forces on it. There is gravity acting down and
there is me countering gravity with exactly the right amount I'm
applying the force <i>mg</i>. So, work done by me would be positive
because I want it to go up, and it goes up. So, if it goes up by an
amount <i>h</i> work done by me is <i>mg</i> times <i>h</i>. Work done
by gravity in the meantime is minus <i>mg</i> times <i>h,</i> so the
total work done is zero. So, this formula says this is the total force,
but I'm telling you if you take the work done and call it Δ<i>W</i> it
maybe a result of many works, work done by me, work done you, work done
by somebody else, some are positive, some are negative, you add them
all up. So, that is the notion of work done by one of many forces
acting on a body. And the total work done is the algebraic sum of the
work done by all the forces.</p>

<p>Alright, so we've got this result; let's do the following. Let us
imagine all of this occurs in a time Δ<i>t</i>. Then
Δ<i>K</i>/Δ<i>t</i>, which will eventually become <i>dK/dt</i> if you
take all the proper limits becomes <i>F</i> times <i>dx/dt</i>, which
is force times velocity and that's called power. So, power is the rate
at which work is done.</p>

<p>For example, if I climb a 12-story building I've done some work; my
<i>m</i> times <i>g</i> times the height of the building. I can climb
the building in one minute, I can climb the building in one hour, the
work done is the same, but the power is a measure of how rapidly work
is done. That's why it's the product of force and velocity. So, the
units for power are joules per second; now, that also has a new name,
which is watts or just <i>W</i>. You may use a kilowatt, which is
<i>kW</i>, little k then W is thousand watts. So, if you've got a
60-watt bulb, it's consuming energy at the rate of 60 joules per
second. That's the meaning of a 60-watt bulb.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm going to do the next generalization, which is when the
force is not a constant but varies with <i>x</i>. So, do we know any
example of a force that varies with location?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> A spring.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> A spring is one example. Even
gravity I think we know is not a secret, the force of gravity is
<i>mg</i> near the Earth, but if you go sufficiently far you will
notice gravity itself is getting weaker. It'll still look like
<i>mg</i> but <i>g</i> won't be 9.8, <i>g</i> will become 9.6 and 9.2
and 9.1, it'll decrease. But the variation of gravity in terrestrial
experiments is pretty small so we won't worry about it. But the force
of a spring definitely varies with <i>x</i> in a noticeable way. The
force of a spring is one concrete example; it's what you all seem to
recognize; it's this one [(<i>-kx</i>)].</p>

<p>So then, we have to ask what is the Work Energy Theorem when the
forces itself vary? So, let's draw ourselves a force which is varying,
here is <i>x</i>, here is my force; it does something. <i>F = kx</i> or
<i>–kx</i> is a particular graph, I'm just taking any function of
<i>x</i> that I want. Now, the acceleration is not constant because the
force is not a constant. So, if you wait for one hour the change in
kinetic energy is not simply force times distance because what force
are you going to use? It was something now, it is something later, it
is positive, now it's negative later. So, we cannot apply this formula
because <i>F</i> is not a constant. So, the usual trick in calculus is
find me an interval in <i>x</i>, which is so narrow, and I'll make it
as narrow as you insist, so that during that period I'll think that
<i>F</i> is a constant and the constant value of <i>F</i> is just the
function <i>F</i> at that time x, at that time where the location is
<i>x</i>. So, for that tiny interval I can still say that <i>F</i> is
constant; <i>F</i> over <i>m</i> is some constant over the tiny
interval, then the change in kinetic energy will be then <i>F(x)</i>
times <i>Δx</i>. Then, you wait a little longer, you go to a new place,
then you've got a new value of the force, maybe somewhere here. Then,
that times <i>Δx</i> is the work done in that region. But
geometrically, <i>F(x)</i> times <i>Δx</i> is the area of the little
rectangle whose base is <i>Δx</i> and whose height is the function
<i>F</i> at that time.</p>

<p>So, if you eventually went from here to here [distance on graph],
let me call that point as <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and let me call the
ending point as <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, then the work done by you is
really given by the area under that graph. And in every segment you
pick up the change in kinetic energy, you add it all up. When we say
add it all up on the left-hand side, all the <i>ΔK</i>s will add up to
give me the final minus initial kinetic energy. This one is what is
written in the notation of calculus as <i>F(x)dx</i> from
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>. This is called the
integral of the function <i>F(x)</i>.</p>

<p>Now again, in a course at this level I'm assuming that you guys know
what an integral is. Even if you've never heard of an integral, if I
give you a function and you never heard of calculus, you can still deal
with this problem. Because you'll come to me and say, "Give me your
function." I'm going to plot it in some kind of graph paper with a grid
on it, and I'm just going to count the number of tiny squares enclosed
here. That's the area and that's the change in kinetic energy. So,
integration is finding the area under graphs bounded by the function of
the top, <i>x</i> axis below, and two vertical lines at the starting
and ending points.</p>

<p>Now, a little digression. Even though you're supposed to know this,
I want to make sure--part of my "No Child Left Behind" program, that
you all follow this. If you never heard calculus or integral calculus
this is going to be a two-minute, three-minute introduction. There is a
great secret, which is that if you give me a function and you tell me
to find the area under this from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, I can go to the graph paper and draw that, or
there is quite often a trick. You don't have to draw anything, you
know. And I will tell you a little more about what it is. If you give
me a function <i>F(x)</i>, the area under this graph happens to be the
following. There is another function <i>G(x)</i> that will be specified
in a moment. And you just have to find <i>G</i> at the upper limit
minus <i>G</i> at the lower limit, and that will be the area. And who
is this mystery function <i>G</i>? It is any function whose derivative
is the given function <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>So, the whole business of finding area which was solved around
Newton's time, is if you have a function they want the area under it,
you go and think of a function whose derivative is the given function.
So, it is the opposite of taking derivatives. Differentiation is an
algorithmic process; you take <i>F(x)</i>, you add a <i>Δx</i> to the
<i>x</i>, you find the change in <i>F</i> divide by <i>Δx</i>. Given
any function you can do that. This is the opposite; this is guessing
the function <i>G</i> whose derivative is <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>So, if I say <i>F(x)</i> equals <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>, then
<i>G(x)</i> is that function whose derivative is <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>.
So, I know I've got to start with <i>x</i> to the 4<sup>th</sup>
because when I take derivatives it'll become an <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>,
but with the 4 in it. So, I fight that by putting a 4 downstairs and
that's the function <i>G</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Shouldn't there be a <i>c</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, that is the plus <i>c</i>.
The <i>c</i> is, of course, velocity of light [students laugh]. Now,
why is this plus <i>c</i> there? She's quite right, because if you've
got a function whose derivative is something, adding a constant doesn't
change the derivative. Then you can say, "Well, we are in trouble now
because you told me to find the function <i>G</i>, and you're telling
me the world cannot agree on what <i>G</i> is because I've got one
<i>G</i>, you've got another one with a different constant." But the
beauty is that when you take this difference, I may not put the
constant, and you may put the constant, but it's going to cancel out.
So, most of the time, people don't bother with the constant. Sometimes
it's very important to keep the constant in place -- it plays a special
role -- but we don't want that here. We'll just call this the
integral.</p>

<p>So, maybe it's again worth asking for a second, why is this true,
you know. Why is <i>G</i> the function whose derivative is <i>F</i>?
Why is that the answer to the problem? Well, one way to think about it,
this is really more for your completeness than anything else. Suppose
there is a function <i>F</i>, and I'm finding the area, let me find it
up to the point that I'm going to call <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. For the
starting point let me just pick zero. This is the area I'm looking for,
and I write it as <i>F(x)dx</i> from zero to the point
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. You agree that as I slide <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>
back and forth, the area is varying with <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, so it's
legitimate to call that a function of <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. A function
is anything that depends on something else, and we all agree that if
the point actually moves, the area moves. This is my shorthand for the
area. The starting point is nailed at zero; this is
<i>G(x<sub>2</sub>)</i>. The left asks what is
<i>G(x<sub>2</sub>+Δ)</i>. That is the area to this point, that we
denoted as <i>F(x)dx</i> from zero to <i>x<sub>2</sub> + Δ</i>, that's
<i>G(x<sub>2</sub>+Δ)</i>.</p>

<p>So, what is the difference between the two? The difference between
the two is <i>G(x<sub>2</sub> + Δ) - G(x<sub>2</sub>)</i>. If you look
at that graph, the extra area that I have is this thing, and that is
clearly equal to <i>F</i> at the point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> times
<i>Δx</i>. In other words, by how much is the area changing when I
change the upper limit? Well, it's changing by the height of the
function at the very last moment times the change in <i>x</i>. Well, we
know what to do now, divide by <i>Δx</i> and take the limit, and you
can see that <i>F(x<sub>2</sub>)</i> is <i>dG/dx</i> at the point
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. But the point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> is whatever
point you want. So, we drop the label, and we just say that <i>F</i> as
a function of <i>x</i> is <i>dG/dx</i>. This is the origin of the
result that the area can be found if you can find the inverse
derivative of the function.</p>

<p>So, let's keep a couple of popular examples in mind. One, if
<i>F(x)</i> equals the constant, then the <i>G(x)</i> is equal to
constant times <i>x</i>. If <i>F(x) = x</i> then, <i>G(x)</i> is equal
to <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> over 2. As you know, the integral of
x<sup>n</sup> is x<sup>n</sup> +1 over n + 1. There are integrals for
all kinds of functions, and you check them by taking derivatives and
make sure you get back your <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>Alright, suppose this is what we learned from the math guys, then go
back to the Work Energy Theorem and see what it says,
<i>K<sub>2</sub>-K<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, I didn't complete one story; let me finish that.
This was, if <i>G(x<sub>2</sub>)</i> was the area from zero to the
point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>G(x<sub>1</sub>)</i> is the area from
zero to the point <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>. That is perhaps clear to you,
if I only wanted the area between the point <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and
the point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, I can take the area all the way up to
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, subtract from it the area all the way up to
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, and that's of course the claim that this integral
<i>F(x)dx</i> from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> is
<i>G(x<sub>2</sub>) - G(x<sub>1</sub>)</i>. That's the reason the
integral is given by a difference of this <i>G</i>. So, let me use a
shorthand notation and call <i>G(x<sub>2</sub>)</i> as simply
<i>G<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>G(x<sub>1</sub>)</i> is <i>G<sub>1</sub></i>.
You should understand, <i>G<sub>2</sub></i> means <i>G</i> evaluated at
the final point, <i>G<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>G</i> evaluated initial
point. So, you have got <i>K<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub></i> is
<i>G<sub>2</sub> - G<sub>1</sub></i>, but <i>G</i> is some definite
function of <i>x</i>. You've got to understand that. For example, it
could be <i>x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over 2 -
<i>x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over 2 in the problem where <i>F</i>
is equal to <i>x</i>. Then, let's rearrange this thing to read
<i>K<sub>2</sub> - G<sub>2</sub></i> is equal to <i>K<sub>1</sub> -
G<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, the Work Energy Theorem says that, "If a force is acting on a
body, a variable force associated with the force is the function
<i>G</i>, a variable function of <i>x</i>, whose derivative is the
given force." Then, at the beginning, if you take the difference of
kinetic energy minus the value of <i>G<sub>2</sub></i>, it'll be the
same. I'm sorry, <i>K<sub>1</sub> - G<sub>1</sub></i>, it'll be the
same as <i>K<sub>2</sub> - G<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, we don't like the form in which this is written. We have to
make a little cosmetic change, and the cosmetic change is to introduce
the function <i>U(x)</i>, which is minus this function <i>G(x)</i>. So,
once you do that, you've got to remember now the force is equal to
minus the derivative of this function, because of the minus sign
relating <i>G</i> to <i>U</i>. Then, we can write it as
<i>K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub> = K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1</sub></i>.
And that combination, if you call that as <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> and you
call this combination as <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>, we are saying,
<i>E<sub>1</sub> = E<sub>2</sub></i>, and that's called the
Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>So, what does conservation mean? Conservation of Energy in physics
has a totally different meaning from conservation of energy in daily
life. Here it means, when a body's moving under the effect of this
force <i>F(x)</i>, you agree it's gaining speed or losing speed or
doing all kinds of things. So, as it moves around it's speeding up and
slowing down, so its speed is definitely a variable, but a certain
magic combination connected to the velocity of the object and to its
location, <i>U</i> depends on <i>x</i>, that does not change with time.
And it's very useful to know that does not change with time, because if
you knew the value of <i>E</i>, even if <i>E</i> were to equal some
fixed number <i>E</i> at one time you know <i>E</i> at all of the
times.</p>

<p>So, let's take a simple example. So, we take a rock and we drop it.
We know it's picking up speed; we know it's losing height. So, you may
think maybe there is some combination of height and speed, which does
not change in this exchange, and we find the combination by this rule
now. In the case of gravity, <i>F = -mg</i>; therefore, <i>U = mg</i>
times <i>y</i>, because –<i>du/dy</i> will now be my <i>F</i>. Then, we
may conclude that ½<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>mgy</i> at the initial
time will be equal to ½<i>mv<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> +
<i>mgy<sub>2</sub></i> at the final time. And that is the--And the
whole thing can be evaluated any time. You take any random time you
want. The sum of these two numbers doesn't change. And that's a very,
very powerful result. So, I'm going to give you one more example later
when you can see the power of this. But in the case of gravity, this is
what it means. So, this agrees with the intuitive notion that when you
lose height you gain speed, when you lower your <i>y</i> you gain
speed, but it's much more precise than that. Instead of saying vaguely,
"you lose and gain," ½<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> is the part connected with
the speed and <i>mgy</i> is the part connected with the height and that
sum does not change with time.</p>

<p>So, let's go back to the mass and spring system. In the case of the
mass and spring system, if you have a mass connected to a spring, then
we say here ½<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> + ½<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i> equal to
<i>E</i> is a constant. That means, find it at any initial time one,
find it at any final time two, add these two numbers, the total will
not change.</p>

<p>So, let me put that to work. Let me use that in a calculation. So, I
say here is a spring; here is where it likes to be. I'm going to pull
it to a new location <i>a</i>. <i>x</i> = 0 is where the spring likes
to be. I'm going to pull it by an amount A and I'm going to let it go.
And I want to know how fast the guy is moving when it comes back to,
say, <i>x</i> = 0.</p>

<p>If you go back to Newton's laws, it's a pretty complicated problem.
You have got to think about why it's a complicated problem. Because you
start with a mass at rest, if you pull it by an amount <i>A</i>, a
force acting on it, it would be <i>–k</i> times <i>A</i>; that will
produce a tiny acceleration, will produce an acceleration, right,
<i>kA/m</i>, which will give it a new velocity by the time it comes
here. But once it comes to the new location, a little later, a
different force is acting on it. Because the <i>x</i> is now different,
so the acceleration during this interval is different, and the gain and
the velocity of that interval will be different from that in the first
interval. You've got to add all these changes to find the velocity
here. That's a difficult proposition, but with the Law of Conservation
of Energy you'll do that in one second.</p>

<p>In fact, let's do it not just to be at the mid point here, but at
any point <i>x</i> measured from equilibrium. Because we will say
initially ½<i>mv<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> + ½<i>kx<sub>1</sub>²</i>
= ½<i>m v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> + ½<i>kx<sub>2</sub>²</i>. This
is the truth; this is a constant that does not change with time. Now,
to get some mileage out of this, you've got to know what the constant
value is. Well, we know what it is in the beginning because when you
pull this guy, at the instant we knew it had no velocity, and we knew
it was sitting at the point <i>A</i>, so we know ½<i>k
A<sub>1</sub>²</i> is the total energy of this mass and spring system.
That's not going to change with time. We like to say that at the
initial time all the energy is potential energy; there is no kinetic
energy because there is no motion. At any subsequent time, this number
has to be equal to what you get. Now, let me drop the subscript to
there [pointing to equation]. Let it stand for some generic instant in
the future. This much we know. Now, do you see that we can solve for
the velocity on any location <i>x</i>? You pick the <i>x</i>; if you
want <i>x</i> to be zero that's very easy, you kill that term, you
balance these two, you cancel the half and you can see that's a formula
for <i>v<sup>2</sup></i>. <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> is going to be
<i>ka<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>m</i>; that is going to be the velocity
when it swings by this midpoint. But you can pick any <i>x</i> you
like, if the <i>x</i> was not zero but .1; well, put the .1, take it to
the other side and solve for <i>v</i>. This is one example of the Law
of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>So, the power of the Law of Conservation of Energy is if you knew
the initial energy, you don't have to go through Newton's laws, and
you'll find it in all the problem sets and many exams. When a problem
is given to you and you are told to find the velocity of something, you
should try whenever possible to use the Law of Conservation of Energy
rather than going to Newton's laws.</p>

<p>So, if you want to know what have we done, how come finding the
velocity seemed so difficult when I described it to you earlier, and
would we have done it, the answer is, if you tell me the force of the
spring is a function of <i>x</i>, I have done that integral in the Work
Energy Theorem, once and for all. The integral of the spring force has
been integrated once and for all and that's what the potential energy
is doing. The potential energy comes from integrating that force.
Alright, so now lets take another problem where there are two forces
acting. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Could you explain really quick how you got the ½ in
front of the <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i> for the energy?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Let me see, here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> No, down at the bottom of the center, yeah.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is it just because of the integration?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, for a spring I think we
said here, if the force is <i>x</i>, the potential energy is <i>G =
x<sup>2</sup></i>/2, <i>U</i> will be <i>-x<sup>2</sup></i>/2. So, the
force is <i>–kx</i>, then you have to find the <i>U</i> so that
<i>–du/dx</i> = <i>–kx</i> and the answer to that is <i>U</i> is
<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>/2. So, if you knew the force, you just find the
function <i>U</i> by asking, "Whose derivative gives me <i>F</i> with a
minus sign?" Then you are done. That's the potential energy for that
problem.</p>

<p>Now, lets take another problem, a mass is hanging from the ceiling.
Then, it's got two kinds of potential energy, one is just a
gravitational potential energy, and the other is a spring potential
energy, and that's going to come because <i>K<sub>2</sub> -
K<sub>1</sub></i> will be the integral of <i>F(x)dx</i>. I'm sorry,
let's call it <i>dy</i> and <i>F(y)dy</i> from <i>y<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>y<sub>2</sub></i>. And this <i>F(y)</i> will have two parts, the
force of gravity -- I'm tired of writing the limits -- then, the force
of the spring, from 1 to 2 [adding the limits to the integrals]. Right,
there are two forces acting on it. This one will be <i>mgy<sub>2</sub>
- mgy<sub>1</sub></i>, this one will be
½<i>ky<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> -
½<i>ky<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. So, every force acting on the body
will turn into a potential energy, because the force--Newton's law says
Work Energy Theorem applies to the total force. So, the total force is
two parts, and you can do two integrals; each integral is an upper
limit minus lower limit of some function and this is what you get
[pointing to formula].</p>

<p>Oh, I think I made one mistake here. I think this should give me,
yes, this overall sign is wrong in these equations. Really, there's a
minus in that and minus in that. In other words, the work done by the
force, if there's only one force acting, is really <i>U(1) - (U2)</i>.
You see why I got the sign wrong? When you do the integral in calculus,
integral of <i>F</i> is <i>G<sub>2</sub> - G<sub>1</sub></i>, but
<i>G</i> and <i>U</i> are minuses of each other. So, integral of force
will give <i>U</i> initially <i>-U</i> finally. So, it should really be
<i>+ mgy<sub>1</sub> - mgy<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, the Law of Conservation of Energy for this object will be that,
½<i>mv<sup>2</sup> + mgy +</i> ½<i>ky<sup>2</sup></i> is the total
energy and will not change. So, this mass can bump up and down and go
back and forth. If you knew the total of these three numbers at one
instant, you know the value at any other instant. For example, if you
pulled it from its equilibrium by .2 centimeters and you released it,
and you say what's the speed when it's .1 centimeters away, it's very
easy because you know the initial energy was all spring energy and
gravitational energy. At any later time if you knew the <i>y</i>, if
you knew the position, you know the potential energy; that's the whole
point. Potential energy depends on where you are; kinetic energy
depends on how fast you're moving. And some combination of where you
are and how fast you're moving is invariant, does not change with time.
So, if you tell me where you are, I will tell you how fast you're
moving. By the way, remember the kinetic energy enters as
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>. You can imagine, when you solve for <i>v</i>
you're always going to get two answers. Why is that? Does it make any
sense? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Because you're going to have the same potential
energy [Inaudible] problem if you're oscillating [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Or, if a spring is going back
and forth at a given point <i>x</i>, you can have two velocities
because you could be going away from the center, or it can be going
back towards the center. So, this tells you the velocity on those two
will be related by a minus sign, right? If you pull the spring this
way, when you go through the origin you say, "What's my velocity?" I'll
get two answers because I could be going to the origin or I could go
the other way and on the way back again pass the origin. So, every
<i>x</i> you'll get two velocities. And that agrees well with the fact
that <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> is what you will solve for. And because it's
quadratic you will get two answers and you should get two answers; you
should be expecting that.</p>

<p>Okay, now, we are going to find one bad boy, bad girl, bad person,
which is going to ruin this whole thing. There is--you know what I'm
talking about here, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Friction [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> So, friction is a force acting
on a body, so what's the thing I should try to do? Let's take a body
with only friction acting on it. Let's not worry about anything else,
or maybe friction and a spring. So, I try as usual, to get a Law of
Conservation of Energy when friction is acting, and you will see that I
will not succeed. And it looks like everything here is water-tight,
right? Everything looks good. You tell me the force acting on a body. I
integrate the force from start to finish and I call that the difference
of potential energies; then I've got my result. Try to follow this
logic: <i>K<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub></i> is integral to force,
integral to <i>G(x<sub>2</sub>) - G(x<sub>1</sub>)</i> or which is
<i>U(x<sub>1</sub>) - U(x<sub>2</sub>)</i>; you can rearrange it to get
<i>K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub></i> <i>=</i> <i>K<sub>1</sub> +
U<sub>1</sub></i>. Looks like you can always get Law of Conservation of
Energy. And you want to know why that fails when there is friction.</p>

<p>Okay, why does it fail when there is friction? So, when there is
friction--Let me try to do it again. <i>K<sub>2</sub> -
K<sub>1</sub></i> is the force due to the spring, which is whatever
<i>–kx</i>. Let me do that integral plus the force of friction
<i>dx</i>, from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. This one
is from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> and we saw what
this is. Let me write it one more time,
½<i>kx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> makes
½<i>kx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>; if you didn't have friction you are
done. Because you can get kinetic plus potential for spring, is kinetic
plus potential. Why don't we just integrate the force of friction and
then turn that into a <i>U</i> and then we're done? What's going to be
the problem? Let me just give some--anybody else want--yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's always against the direction of motion so it
would be always changing direction force [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay what was your answer?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You can't associate a potential function with
friction because it depends on the path, not only the initial position
and final position. The anti-derivative only considers the final and
the initial position.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, but let's suppose I'm
somewhere and I'm pulling a block and there is some friction, there is
some force <i>F</i> at the location, there's my <i>F</i>. Why don't I
just use the value of <i>F</i>? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Energy is lost due to heat.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I know but see, you are saying
something else which is speaking, I had into the book, but right now
what's the problem with integrating the force of friction?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I was just going to say the energy of the force of
friction is no longer within the system [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, but you're all telling me
why there is a loss of mechanical energy but I'm just a mathematician.
I'm saying, give me a force, find its integral. What's the problem?
Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is it because the function to the force of friction
depends on the velocity?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, I think somebody else said
that earlier also. The force of friction is not a function of <i>x</i>.
You might say, "What do you mean?" I'm pushing this guy, I know how
hard it's pushing me back, but I'm telling you now, "Push it the
opposite way!" Then, you'll find the force of friction at the very same
location is pointing in a different direction whereas the force of a
spring is the force of the spring. It's <i>-kx</i>, whether you're
going towards the spring or you're going away from the spring; try to
think about that. Same with gravity. Gravity is pulling you down with a
force <i>-mg</i> and it doesn't care whether the chalk is going up or
coming down. On the way up it's pulling it down; on the way down it's
also pulling it down, because at a given location there is a fixed
force. So, the problem is not the force varies with <i>x</i> or
<i>y</i>, but the force is a function only of <i>x</i>. But if the
function of <i>x</i> and velocity then you also have to know the
velocity, and no one's giving you then a definite value for the
velocity because in the vibrating mass and spring, velocity can have
either sign.</p>

<p>Therefore, we do this integral but we don't do this. Even though I
write it this way, mathematically it's wrong because the force of
friction--Is it really a function of <i>x</i>? I'll tell you in what
limited sense it is a function and what technical sense it is not.
Let's defer that for now. Take all these guys to the left-hand side, so
this is <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>, this'll become <i>U<sub>2</sub></i>, so
you'll get <i>(K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub>) -
(K<sub>1</sub>+U<sub>1</sub>)</i> is equal to this last thing, work
done by friction from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> and
the question is, "Can I do the integral?" The answer is, if you just
tell me <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, then I know
that's the point you're making; I cannot just do an integral because I
will have to know the whole story, but in limited cases I can do this.
Suppose I pulled a mass by an amount <i>A</i> and I let it go, but now
there is friction. I think we all know that if it came to the center it
won't be going quite as fast. And we also know, when it overshoots the
other side, it will not go back to <i>–A</i>; normally, it will go back
to <i>-A</i>. Everyone knows why it goes back to <i>-A</i>, right? When
you go the other extremity without friction, your energy is all
potential. It was ½<i>kA<sup>2</sup></i> to begin with, it's going to
be ½<i>kA<sup>2</sup></i> at the end, except <i>A</i> can go to
<i>-A</i> without changing the answer; that's why it'll go from
<i>A</i> to <i>-A</i>. But when you've got friction, I cannot say the
energies are equal because I've got to do this integral. For this part
of the journey from here to here, during that part of the journey, the
force is a well-defined function. Namely, it is a constant value
<i>-µ</i> times <i>mg</i> and it is acting this way. So, for this part
of the trip, I can do the integral. It is very easy to find out what it
is; it's <i>-mg</i> times <i>µ</i> kinetic, times the distance
traveled.</p>

<p>Of course, it's a little more complicated now. You have to tell me
where you want your velocities. You might say, find the velocity at
<i>x</i> = 0. If you want me to do that, the distances traveled is the
original displacement. That's what is the stuff on that side. And here,
<i>K<sub>2</sub></i> = ½<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> which is what I'm trying
to find. I am at the origin so it's ½<i>k</i> times 0<sup>2</sup>, no
potential energy. Initially, there is no kinetic energy but there was
potential energy ½<i>kA<sup>2</sup></i>. You follow that logic now?
This is the difference in energies due to the conserved forces, the
conserved energies, but the difference <i>E<sub>2</sub> -
E<sub>1</sub></i> is no longer 0 but is given by this number. So, I can
calculate it for this part.</p>

<p>I can even ask, -- this is one of the homework problems, I think --
you're asked, "How far does it go to the left?" Well, what do you do?
Let's call the place where it goes to. The left most extremity is
<i>A</i> prime. Then we don't know, so there when you go to
<i>K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub>+ U<sub>1</sub></i>,
you will go back to this formula. First of all, the distance that the
force of friction acts on is how much--is the distance <i>A</i> to come
here and another <i>A</i> prime to go to the left. <i>A</i> prime is a
magnitude of how far you go to the left. And likewise, on the left-hand
side you've got to have the total kinetic plus potential minus kinetic
plus potential. At the end of the day, you only have potential energy
½<i>k A</i> prime squared, no kinetic and initially, again, you only
have potential energy ½<i>kA<sup>2</sup></i>. You will see that A prime
now satisfies a quadratic equation; you can solve it.</p>

<p>But what is the point? The point is you cannot do this integral once
and for all and say the answer depends on the end points. In this
particular problem, if you told me you are doing this part of the
journey, during that part of the journey because for the entire trip,
the velocity had a particular sign, namely to the left, force of
friction had a definite magnitude and sign, namely to the right, and
then of course it's as good as any legitimate function and you can do
the integral. In fact, the forces are constant; you can pull it out of
the integral, and the integral <i>dx</i> is just the distance traveled.
Okay, so work done by friction--it will always come out negative and
you should keep track of that.</p>

<p>Okay, so the final bottom line for Law of Conservation of Energy
that you guys should remember is the following. You take all the forces
acting on a body. So, lets do it one more time in our heads, so you
know where everything comes from. Everything comes from this result
<i>K<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub></i>, which is the work done, is
integral of all the forces. Divide the forces into forces that depend
on location only and not on anything else, like velocity. Let me just
divide them into two forces, one is a good force, <i>F<sub>g</sub>
dx</i>, and one is a force of friction, <i>dx</i>. This guy will turn
into a potential energy difference. Let me just take one good force and
the force of friction. If you had two, each will generate its own
potential when you do the integral. Then, we may then say
<i>E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>1</sub></i>; that's the same as
<i>(K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub>) - (K<sub>1</sub> +U<sub>1</sub>)</i>
is equal to the work done by friction. Work done by friction is the
shorthand for that integral which you can do only; you must divide the
motion involved into pieces. For example, if you have a mass that swung
to the left then turns around and goes back to the right, of course,
again, it won't come back to the original, it'll come to a smaller
number. That's because there's more loss of energy on the return trip.
For the return trip, you must do the problem separately. On the return
trip, you start from this <i>A</i> prime that you found, then start
moving to the right, the friction will act to the left. So, you must
divide the motion into segments. During each segment the force should
have a definite direction and magnitude so you can do the integral. The
point is, there is no universal formula for <i>F(x)</i> due to
friction.</p>

<p>So, in one dimension that's all it is, bringing the good and bad
forces, those which lead to potential, those which don't; the
difference is the good forces are functions of <i>x</i>, bad forces are
functions of <i>x</i> and something else, so that at a given <i>x</i>
it's possible to have two values for that function. Mathematically, we
don't call it a function, that's why you cannot do the integral once
and for all. So, this is the Law of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>Okay? Alright now, what I have to do here for the remaining time is
a little more of some mathematical preparation for what I'm going to do
next. What I'm going to do next is to go to higher dimensions and we've
got to make sure we all know some of the mathematical ideas connected
to the higher dimensions. So, I'm going to start off with some things
and this is like a mathematical interlude. Again, I told you, if you're
not strong on some of these things you should read this math book I
mentioned to you on <i>Basic Training</i>; it'll certainly cover these
topics. But you don't have to have that, I'm going to tell you now how
to do it. So, the math idea that I'm going to use, see this is really a
mathematical digression to make sure everybody knows, they are very
simple things, but we do it all the time in physics so I want to make
sure you guys can also do that.</p>

<p>So, let's take some function <i>F(x)</i> that looks like this. This
is <i>F(x)</i>, this is <i>x</i> [pointing to graph]. And let's say you
start here, at some point <i>x</i>. And I'm going to go to a nearby
point, <i>x + Δx</i>. <i>Δx</i> is exaggerated so you can see it. So,
actually in the end it's going to be a very small number. The question
is, "What is the change in the function in going from here to here?"
So, we all know what it is; that is the change in the function. We are
going to need approximations to the change in the function. The useful
approximation is to say, let us pretend the function is a straight line
and keeps going with the slope it had to begin with. You can see that
if the function is not curving up or down too much, you almost got the
right change in <i>F</i>. And what is the change in <i>F</i>? That
change in <i>F</i> is a derivative of the function at the point
<i>x</i> times the change in <i>x</i>. But it is not an equality; it is
not an equality because there is this little guy on the top that you
have missed. Because the function is not following the same slope that
you have to begin with, it's curving up.</p>

<p>So, let's take a concrete example. Suppose F(x) = x<sup>2</sup>,
then <i>F(x + Δx ) = x<sup>2</sup> +</i> 2<i>xΔx + Δx<sup>2</sup></i>.
Therefore, the change in <i>F</i> -- you got to take it to the other
side -- change in <i>F</i> = 2<i>xΔx</i> +<i>Δx<sup>2</sup></i>.
2<i>xΔx</i>, 2<i>x</i> is, of course, what you realize is that the
derivative of the function at that point. And that's giving you this
part but there's a tiny portion on the top, which is
<i>Δx<sup>2</sup></i> that you're not getting. If the function is
<i>x<sup>3</sup></i>, then <i>x</i> to the fourth, then hyperbolic
<i>cos (x)</i> there'll be more errors. But the point is, the change in
the function has a leading piece that's proportional <i>Δx</i>, and
then the corrections that we see mathematically are of higher order in
<i>Δx</i>.</p>

<p>So, if <i>Δx</i> is made very small but not zero, then it's a very
useful formula to know that the change in function and going from one
point to another point is this rate of change times the change. I don't
think anything could be more natural than that. But we should be
comfortable by saying it's naively people say, "Well, you should do
that because in calculus you're canceling this <i>Δx</i> with that
<i>dx</i>." That's not what we're really doing. We all know that this
stands for a certain limit, but the limit stands literally for the
slope which is at that point. So, if functions had only one slope and
they never changed their slope and you knew that slope, then if you
know the value to begin with, you can find the value a mile away from
where you are because it's going at the same clip. But most functions
of course will change the slope, and for that reason there will be an
error in the formula you get if you use this. But if <i>Δx</i> is very,
very small and it's your intention in the end to make very, very tiny
<i>Δx</i>s then we say we will use this approximation. That's very
simple but it's very useful to know.</p>

<p>So, let's take an example of this function, of this rule, because
I'm going to use it all the time. So, one example is <i>F(x)</i> <i>=
(</i>1 + <i>x)</i><sup>n</sup>. Well, <i>F</i>(1) is just one. Suppose
you go to a nearby point which is <i>x</i> away from the .1; so, this
<i>x</i> is really like your <i>Δx</i>, then the change in the function
will be <i>df/dx</i> at the point 1 times the change in <i>x</i>.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I'm sorry, ah, ok, that's right.
<i>F</i>(0) if you like; if x = 0, the function has a value of one.
Then, if you go to a neighboring point--;So, here is what I'm saying,
the function does something which value here is one and I want to go to
a nearby point which I'm calling <i>x</i>. Then, <i>df/dx</i> you know
is <i>n</i> times 1 + <i>x<sup>n</sup></i> -1 times <i>x</i>. But you
have evaluated it at <i>x</i> = 0, so this goes away, then you get
<i>nx</i>. So, the change in the function, this function as you move
off <i>x</i> = 0 is <i>nx</i>. So, what we are saying then is 1 +
<i>x</i> raised to the <i>n</i> is 1 + <i>nx</i> + tiny numbers, if
<i>x</i> is small. That is a very useful result. If something looks
like 1 + x raised to a power, and if you're not going too far from the
point 1, namely if your <i>x</i> is very small, then don't bother with
doing the whole 1 + x times 1 + xn times, it's approximately equal to 1
+ <i>nx</i>.</p>

<p>So, let me give you one example; you will use this later on.
According to relativity, a mass of a particle is given by this [writes
formula on the board]. It's a body sitting still, it has certain mass.
In Newtonian mechanics we say the mass is the mass and that's the end
of it. Relativity, you don't have to know the origin of this; that'll
be taught to you in due course. But it just says particle to the
velocity have a mass different from when they are at rest. And this is
the velocity and <i>c</i> is the velocity of light. This is the exact
formula.</p>

<p>Now, most of the time we don't care about it because <i>v/c</i>
maybe 10<sup>-10</sup> and the square of that is 10<sup>-20</sup> and
one minus such a number is negligible and we just put it as one.
Suppose you want an answer that's good to some accuracy. I will write
this as follows, as <i>m<sub>0</sub></i> times 1 - <i>v<sup>2</sup></i>
over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> to the power of -½ , do you agree? That's
what a square root in the bottom is, it's this power upstairs. Now, we
can write it as follows, <i>m<sub>0</sub></i>, this is (1 +
x)<sup>n</sup>, okay? So the <i>x</i> that we use is
<i>-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup></i> and the <i>n</i> that we use is -½.
That's what I'm using in this formula; <i>x</i> is
<i>-v<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>n</i>, which is the
power to which I'm raising, is -½; therefore, this is equal to 1 +
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> plus corrections, which are
negligible if <i>v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup></i> is very small. This is
a very useful result. It tells you the mass variation is that is the
mass at rest plus
<i>m<sub>0</sub>v<sup>2</sup>/</i>2<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, it's a very
useful formula. Sometimes this formula is much more friendly to use
than the exact formula. You cannot beat the exact formula; it's the
exact truth but if you're interested in that exact function for small
values of <i>v/c</i>, it's much more useful to use this approximation.
And you will have a lot of problems like this in your homework, now,
later, everywhere else. So, if I'm going to use it all the time I
should tell you what it is.</p>

<p>So, let me summarize what I've told you so far. First result is, if
a function is known at a certain point and you want to know its value
at a nearby point, what are you supposed to do? That's not so hard to
guess right? For example, your tuition costs are so much this year at
Yale. And we know how much it's going up every year; you can make a
guess on what it'll be a year from now. Of course in reality, it'll be
higher than that because there is other terms, but that's the best
guess you would make. That's how we predict the future by looking at
past rates of change; that's very normal. The point is that you can
predict the tuition in a year from now maybe, but maybe not five years
from now or ten years from now because there's inflation on top of
inflation. That's like saying the rate of change itself has a rate of
change, the slope here is not the same as the slope there, that's what
the higher derivatives of the function do for you.</p>

<p>So, I will conclude by telling you one last result which I'm not
going to prove in this course. And you guys should learn from the math
department the following result. There is some crazy function, okay,
this is <i>f(x)</i>, I want to know what it is at the point <i>x</i>. I
know what it is at the origin. If I know nothing else, how do I predict
the future value of <i>x</i>, meaning for other <i>x</i> I don't know.
My best guess is, well, this is the number I knew that's what it's
going to do. But if I knew its rate of change here, you know, its slope
here, the next guess is the derivative of <i>f</i> at the origin times
<i>x</i>. That's just what I did earlier; instead of <i>Δx</i> I'm
calling it <i>x</i>. If <i>x</i> is small enough it'll work.</p>

<p>But of course, <i>x</i> need not be small; if it gets bigger, it
turns out you can do a little better by adding this [writes formula on
board]. This is the second derivative of the function at the origin
times <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> and you can go on adding more and more
terms. I'll just add one more term, which is 1/3 times
<i>d<sup>3</sup>x</i>, <i>f/dx<sup>3</sup></i> times
<i>x<sup>3</sup></i>. This goes on forever. And it says that if you
knew every derivative of the function at the origin you can reconstruct
the function. Not just infinitesimally close to it, but as far as you
want to go, there are some mathematical restrictions on this because
there are infinite number of terms in this thing. When you add them all
up you may get infinity which would be nonsense. So, you should really
sum up this infinite number of terms if they add up to a finite number,
and if they do that will give you the function here. What we have done
is to just use the first two terms as an approximation. Or what I'm
telling you is that there is something called The Taylor Expansion of a
function that allows you to know the function even here,
macroscopically, far from here if you knew all the derivatives. And if
you put those derivatives here and if the sum added up to something
finite, that finite thing is the value of the function at the new
point.</p>

<p>Here is an example you guys can take, <i>f(x) = e<sup>x</sup></i>.
Why don't you go home and work out the series for <i>f(x)</i> at all
points? You have got to remember that <i>e<sup>x</sup></i> has a
beauty, that the derivative is <i>e<sup>x</sup></i> itself. And its
value at the origin of every derivative is simply one. So, this just
becomes 1 + <i>x</i> + <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2. And that is, in fact,
the expression for <i>e<sup>x</sup></i> and it turns out that no matter
how big <i>x</i> is, the sum in fact adds up to a finite number that we
call <i>e<sup>x</sup></i>. And in particular, what is <i>e</i> itself,
<i>e</i> itself <i>e</i> to the 1; <i>e</i> is <i>e</i> to the 1 so put
<i>x</i> = 1 you get 1 + 1 + 1<sup>2</sup> over 2 factorial plus
1<sup>3</sup> over 3 factorial. You do all that you get 2 point
something, something. Alright, that's <i>e</i>. So, this is a very
powerful notion. If you knew all the derivatives of a function, you can
predict its value not only the tiny neighborhood, but over big
distance. If you knew the first derivative and you were not very
ambitious. Look, the logic is very simple. If <i>x</i> is a tiny number
<i>x<sup>2</sup></i> is even tinier, <i>x<sup>3</sup></i> is even
tinier. We've got no respect for these terms. We just drop them and we
stop here. Okay, I'll have something more to say about this later on.
But for now, these ideas will be useful for what we're doing next
time.</p>
