<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Let's start with a brief recall of Gauss's Law. It is so important I wanted to
make sure you guys understand not only how it is used but how it's derived. I
derived it for you last time, but I thought the presentation could be improved
a little bit, so I'm going to do it one more time, just this time only hitting
the highlights. The content of Gauss's Law is very easy to visualize, so I'm
going to draw you a picture that'll tell you the whole story, then there are
all the equations. The picture is the following. You take one charge <i>q</i> and you draw the lines of force coming from the one charge. It's a point
charge. Therefore, you have no freedom but to draw lines that look like this.
Now, how many lines you draw is a matter of convention. You can draw eight or
twelve, whatever it is, but you've got to agree that the number per coulomb
should be fixed. So we'll fix some number. So I'm going to pick for whatever
charge is here these lines. You cannot have a distribution of lines in which
it's suddenly more dense in just this direction, for example. That's not
allowed, because if I take this point charge and I rotate it, it looks the same,
but if I took the line distribution with more dense here than other places if I
rotate it, it looks different. So if the cause of the field lines looks the
same after rotation, the effect, which is the field lines, should not change.
You can only have a distribution of lines with respect to symmetry of the
source of the cause of the field lines. </p>
<p>You understand that?
It cannot be biased one way or the other, whereas this distribution, if you
turn it around, looks exactly the same. So we draw those lines, and the
content of Gauss's Law is really the following. We are going to count the
lines crossing a sphere, S, and we're going to count the lines crossing some
generic surface S&#39;. You can see at a glance without doing any calculations
that the following is true. Lines crossing S = lines crossing S&#39;, right?
That's clear to everybody? You don't need to do any equation for that. That's
because the lines have nowhere to go but out, and you can count them on this
circle, that circle as long as you enclose the whole thing, the solid surface.
Enclosing this charge you're going to get the same lines. That's the heart of
Gauss's Law, but that's not the final form, but that's the part that starts
everything. Now I'm going to calculate the left hand side, and I'm going to
calculate the right hand side. I'm going to equate them. </p>
<p>From that I will get
almost everything I want. Now, how many lines are coming out of S? We
know--first the notion of line density. I've got to remind you what a line
density is. Line density is the lines per area, but it's not enough to say
area. I'm going to put a perpendicular symbol there. That means the lines are
going, say, from left to right like this. You want to put an area that
intercepts it perpendicularly, or if you like, the area vector which is always
normal to the area should be parallel to the lines. So it's the number of
lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines. That's called the line
density. If you tilted this area; the same area, but at a bad angle, it'll
intersect fewer lines. That you know. </p>
<p>Okay, so this is the
meaning of line density. What's the line density going to look like in this
problem? Line density is going to be proportional to the charge you have
because we agreed we'll put some number of lines per coulomb, and it's
inversely proportional to the radius because the area of a sphere of radius <i>r</i>
is 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>. So if you cut it with a bigger sphere of bigger
radius the density, lines per area, will go like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. So
it's proportional to <i>q</i>. It's proportional to 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
okay? So let me write not equal to but proportional to. You have to stop me
if you don't follow anything I'm saying. There's no reason why you shouldn't
follow this argument. Then I say how about the electric field? The strength
of the electric field, not the direction, the electric field <i>E</i> at radius
<i>r</i> is also proportional to <i>q</i> and also proportional to 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
Because from Coulomb's Law the field is the force on a unit test charge, it is <i>q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i>.
<i>q<sub>2</sub></i> is 1 because the test charge is 1 and there's <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
Forget the 4&Pi;. It's proportional to <i>q</i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. </p>
<p>From this we may
conclude that the line density is proportional to the electric field because
they are both proportional to <i>q</i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. Therefore, we can
say line density is equal to some constant c times the electric field in
magnitude; direction of the lines is along <i>E</i>, but the magnitude. Do you
understand that? This guy is proportional to this. This may have some
proportionality constant, this may have another one, but nothing changes the
fact that this expression's proportional to that one. The constant will depend
on details. Let me just call it some number <i>c</i>. <i>c</i> is up to you.
It really depends on how many lines you want to draw per coulomb. I made a
particular choice last time, 1/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> lines per coulomb, but you
don't have to make that to prove the law. So this time I'm just assuming the
lines is proportional to charge, but you pick your own proportionality
constant. So I've got this line density that's proportional to electric
field. Now I'm going to go back and I'm going to calculate the left hand
side. </p>
<p>Now, let's give this
equation a number, equation number 1. I'm going to calculate the left hand
side of 1. Left hand side of 1 is the number of lines crossing this sphere,
S. So that's going to be equal to--let me call it &#934;<sub>S</sub> is equal to number
crossing S, crossing this sphere S. &#934; is the standard symbol for flux. So what is it? Well, &#934;<sub>S</sub> = line density times
area of sphere, because on a sphere the lines are uniform in density so the
total number crossing the sphere is the line density times area of the sphere.
But the line density is a constant times the electric field at radius <i>r </i>(if
you like) times area of the sphere which is 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>. That's the
lines crossing the inner surface which is this sphere of radius <i>r</i>. Now,
&#934;<sub>S&#39;</sub> is lines crossing S&#39;.
Now you've got to be a little careful when you find the lines crossing S&#39;. You
understand why that's more difficult? What are the two complications in
finding the lines crossing S&#39; compared to this one which I did in one second?
Any idea? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The normals are all
parallel to the field lines?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Which is not parallel?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The normal to the
surface isn't parallel to the ________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, the surface is not--surface vector at each point is not parallel to the
electric field. For example, if you've got a crazy surface like this--I'll try
to replicate that surface, but I don't remember what I drew, some weird object
like this. Then the electric field point this way, but the normal to the
surface will point that way. See, <i>E</i> points that way. Tiny area there,
which I'm calling vector <i>dA</i>, points in a different direction. So each
region has a different direction. Secondly, the strength of the field itself
is varying on the surface. Unlike on a sphere where everything is at the same
distance <i>r </i>some are further, some are closer. But it is still true that
if you want the number of lines cross a patch, if you pick a little area here,
if you want to know how many lines cross that you take the normal to the area,
call it a vector <i>dA</i>, and you multiply by line density. </p>
<p>Therefore, this is
equal to the integral of the electric field at some point <i>r</i> dot product
with a tiny area which is there. At each region you've got to draw a different
<i>dA</i>. So you take the surface, you chop it up into tiny little tiles.
Each tile is small enough to be considered a plane. Then the area vector is
perpendicular to the plane, outward from the surface, and of magnitude equal to
the numerical area of the plane. So the lines crossing every tiny little
square on the big surface is the number of lines per unit area times the area
times the cosine of the angle which you need, because the area vector may not
be parallel to the flow. I have explained many times why the flow there, the
flow vector and the area vector are not parallel you've got to put in a cos<i>&#952;</i>.
That's what comes into this dot product. And we write the symbol like this to
tell you not only is it a double integral, meaning integral over a
two-dimensional region, but it's over a closed two-dimensional region. That
symbol is to remind you. </p>
<p>So now, &#934;<sub>S</sub> equal to &#934;<sub>S&#39;</sub> is what I'm going to
write. So I'm going to write--oh, I made one mistake. Can anybody see one
thing missing in this equation here? This equation's not correct. To find the
lines crossing S&#39; I took <i>E</i> times <i>dA</i>. It's a constant <i>c</i>
because the line density is not simply the electric field it's the constant.
So I forgot the constant, but I knew that I would need it because when I now
equate &#934;<sub>S</sub> to &#934;<sub>S&#39;</sub> I get constant times
the electric field at <i>r </i>times 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to
constant times the surface integral of <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> on some surface S&#39;. But <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) times
4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup> </i>is <i>c</i> times <i>q</i>/&#949;<sub>0</sub> because <i>E</i>
is q/4<i>&Pi;</i>&#949;<sub>0</sub><i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. You see that? This much you
should know. I'm not going to write the details. So that is equal to <i>c</i>
times surface integral of <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i>. Now you see the constant does not matter, so whatever
the constant is I can make the following statement and that's going to be the
beginning of Gauss's Law. </p>
<p>So Gauss's Law tells
me that if you took a charge and you sat under it with any surface
whatsoever--I'm not going to put a prime on this anymore. S is going to be the
surface. Then the surface integral of the electric field due to that charge
over a surface is equal to the charge that is sitting inside divided by &#949;<sub>0</sub>,
and it does not depend on the details of the surface. Okay, everybody should
know in principle how to do the surface integral. If I give you a surface, and
at the surface at every point I give you a vector <i>E</i>, which is electric
field, you should know how to numerically calculate it. You may not know how
to do the integral analytically, but operationally you should know the meaning
of this, okay? If <i>E</i> were actually the velocity of some stuff running
out of the volume you're counting in each region how many guys are escaping per
second and you're adding it all up. And to find how many guys are leaving a
tiny area, you multiply the area by the velocity of flow times the cosine of
the angle between the velocity in the area. That's it. </p>
<p>Okay, now we do the
next thing. Let's call this charge <i>q<sub>1</sub> </i>because I'm now going
to put a second guy <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> here. If you now think in terms of
lines of force you're going to get into a big mess because lines of force, due
to two charges is a complicated thing, you remember drawing some pictures. But
now here's the beauty. Forget the lines of force completely, not interested.
I'm interested in the electric field. Focus on the electric field for which
there's a very simple rule. The electric field due to two charges 1 and 2 is
the electric field due to 1 plus the electric field due to 2. That's the great
principle of superposition. Therefore, on the left hand side you might say if
both charges are inside the surface integral of <i>E<sub>1,2</sub></i>meaning
when both are present is equal to surface integral of <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> + surface integral
of <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>&#8901;<i>dA</i>, because <i>E<sub>1,2</sub></i>
is <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>. But the first guy is <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>,
second is <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. Once you can do two
charges you can do any number of charges. </p>
<p>And now we write
Gauss's Law almost in its final form. The final form is that if you took the
total electric field, I'm not going to put total, <i>E</i> will stand for the
total, on a surface <i>S</i> that is equal to the sum of all the charges, <i>i </i>from
1 to whatever many charges you have, divided by <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. The
condition is these are charges inside the volume bounded by the surface. You
do not count the charge here. You only count charges which are inside not
charges which are outside. So let's make a notation that tells you that <i>i</i>
is inside the volume <i>V</i>. And this surface is the boundary of the volume
V. This partial derivative symbol is the universal convention for the boundary
of any region. Okay, if you draw a real circle, this is the circle. The
boundary of the circle is this. If you a have a cube, or if you have an orange
the boundary of the volume orange is the skin of the orange. That's the
definition of boundary. </p>
<p>You can see this is
like the skin of the solid region, and the surface integral on the skin of the
electric field is a charge inside the volume whatever be the shape of the
volume. And it works for all kinds of surfaces. I mean, here's one example.
Suppose you have a charge here. You take a surface that kind of intersects
itself and so on. Then what can happen is if I put a charge here the lines may
go like this. It doesn't matter because over this when it switches back on
itself some lines leave, some lines enter, and some lines leave again. So it
might as well be that surface because double entering and leaving doesn't
matter. So the rule is if <i>q</i> is inside it contributes to the surface
integral, if <i>q</i> is outside it doesn't. The last variation is what if <i>q</i>
is not made up of a discrete set of charges, which you can say one is here one
is there, but there's some continuous blob, some lump of charge where the
charge density--so then we say suppose <i>q</i> is continuous. </p>
<p>You've got to realize
in real life it's never continuous. Real charges are made up of electrons and
protons. They are discrete, but if your eye is not looking at it in great
detail the charge can appear to be continuous. For example, if you take a
glass of water the water is really made up of point molecules, water molecules,
but to your eye it looks like a continuous medium. So for certain purposes we
can replace a discrete distribution by a continuous one. For a continuous
distribution what you have to tell me is the following. This is space <i>x</i>,
<i>y</i>, and. Here's the point. I take a tiny cube whose sides are <i>dx</i>,
<i>dy</i> and <i>dz</i>, and &#961; of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> times <i>dxdydz</i>
is equal to charge in that little cube. In other words, like the usual density
with this mass per unit volume the &#961; is the charge per unit volume. So you
multiply by volume you get the charge, but it need not be uniform. </p>
<p>So if you have a
solid region then the charge density could be varying from point to point, so.
Oh, let's keep it here. In that case you will write the surface integral of <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> over a surface that
binds a volume <i>V</i> would be 1/&#949;<sub>0</sub> times the volume integral of &#961;
of (<i>x, y, z</i>) <i>dxdydz</i>. This is the final form of Gauss's Law.
Now, how many people have ever done integrals in more than one dimension?
Great, very good, made my day because I didn't have Plan B. But I did--no
actually I had a Plan Tiny B which is to give you a quick refresher. If there
is time at the end of the class I will remind you of how the multiple integrals
are done. But right now I'm going to show you the efficacy of this law and
that doesn't require doing complicated integrals. All the integrals will be so
trivial you can just read them off. So when we have time we'll do questions of
how to do these integrals, but I'm assuming this symbol means something to
you. In words it means all the charge inside. </p>
<p>So, again, by taking
the volume, dividing into tiny regions, multiplying each volume, tiny volume,
by the density to get the charge there, and summing over all the volumes inside
the big volume <i>V</i>. That's a charge. So Gauss's Law still says the
surface integral of <i>E</i> is the charge inside over epsilon 0. All right,
so this is the great law. Now we're going to get some mileage out of it to
solve certain problems which normally would be very difficult. The first
problem, I think I probably did that last time but it's worth going over, is
what is the electric field of a uniform density of charge. Suppose there's a
charge <i>Q</i> and this is sphere of radius <i>r</i>, and it is a ball of
radius <i>r</i>. You take all these charges and you pile them on top of each
other. They don't like it, but you glue them or do whatever you have to do.
You've got a ball of charge <i>Q</i>. You want the field due to that. </p>
<p>It's the same problem
Newton had with gravity. The earth is a solid ball. It's got mass everywhere
and you would like to find the force on an apple. And it's not so evident that
the force of the earth on the apple is as if the entire mass of the earth but
at the center. You have to prove that. You have to prove that by dividing the
earth into little pieces and finding the gravitational force of every little
piece on the apple and adding all those vectors up. And when you do all the
hard work you will find, in fact, that it's true, but it took Newton several
years to prove that even though he was pretty certain that was true. That's
very important because when you do the force law for apple versus the earth the
distance you use for <i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> is
a center-to-center distance as if the entire earth were at the center. A
similar law is true for electric forces. </p>
<p>In other words, if
you've got a spherical distribution of charge the field due to that outside
that ball is as if all the charge were at the center. That's what we want to
prove, but we want to prove that without doing any difficult integrals, and the
trick is the following. You are going to use Gauss's Law, and you can use
Gauss's Law on any surface you like. For example, you can take that surface
and you can say surface integral of <i>E</i> on the surface is Q/&#949;<sub>0</sub>,
but that's not very helpful because what you're trying to find out is not the
electric field integrated over a whole region, but the electric field at each
point. You want to know what's going on right there. So even though it's a
true statement that whatever <i>E</i> is doing its integral on any surface is Q/&#949;<sub>0</sub>
that doesn't tell you what is <i>E</i> at every point, and we're going to find
that by the following trick. </p>
<p>The trick is to first
decide. This surface <i>S</i>, by the way, it's called a Gaussian surface.
It's not a real surface. In real life there are no Gaussian surfaces. You
draw them for a calculation, and you can move it around in your mind anyway you
like, for each surface you'll get a different answer. We'll pick a Gaussian
surface equal to a sphere of radius <i>r</i>. So I'm going to pick a Gaussian
surface of radius <i>r</i>. I'm going to argue two things and you have to
follow the reasoning because all the work is in the argument. You don't do any
integrals, but you do some serious arguing. The arguing says it's a ball,
positive charge. It's going to repel a test charge. Which way is the
repulsion going to be at this point? It has to be radially away from the
center. That's your argument. At each point the repulsion has to be away from
the center. In other words the electric field has to have this distribution.
We're not saying how it varies with distance, but it has to be radial. </p>
<p>Again, the argument
is the radially outgoing thing like a hedgehog. It's the only distribution of
lines which will look the same if you rotate them because then one line will go
to another line. The hedgehog will look exactly the same. And that is a
necessary requirement because if you took this ball of charge you all
understand that if you rotate the ball the field lines have to rotate due to
any calculation you did, but if you rotate the ball it looks the same. So the
field lines have to look the same. So the distribution you draw must be
invariant under that rotation. This is a very powerful principle of symmetry
and invariance. The principle says if something is the cause of something, and
if I do something to the cause that leaves it alone, namely it looks the same,
the effect has to look the same. </p>
<p>It's a very
reasonable argument. And the cause here is a ball of charge which is
completely isotropic and spherical. You turn it, it looks the same, so the
field distribution looks the same. That's all you need to proceed because that
distribution then is going to have radial lines of unknown strength, but the
strength can vary only with <i>r</i>, but not at a given <i>r</i>. At a given <i>r
</i>the direction varies, but the strength is some <i>E </i>of <i>r</i>, and
we're asking what is <i>E</i> of <i>r</i>? So we know that <i>E</i> looks like
<i>r</i>, which is the vector of length in the radial direction times <i>E</i>
of <i>r</i>. And sometimes I also write this as <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> times <i>E</i>
of <i>r</i>, and we just want to know what E is a function of <i>r</i>. But
now we can use Gauss's Law. So the left hand side is a surface integral of
this radial <i>E</i> on a sphere of radius <i>r</i>. That's going to be <i>E</i>
times 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>, because <i>E</i> is a constant on the surface. </p>
<p>The integral of a
constant on the surface is the constant times the area of the surface. It's
like saying if you want to integrate a function which is constant from here to
here it's the constant height multiplied by the interval over which you're
integrating. There's no integral to do. It's very trivial. It's a
rectangle. Similarly a constant function integrated on a sphere is the area
times this, but <i>E</i> is the function of, of course, <i>r</i>. That's going
to be charge enclosed. The charge enclosed is <i>Q</i> and you've got to put
the &#949;<sub>0</sub>, and then you find <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) is <i>Q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
And if you want to put all the vectors back you can write here times <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>.
So by this trick one can show that the field of a sphere is as if the charges
were at the center, provided you are talking about a point outside the sphere.
</p>
<p>As long as this field
is outside the real ball no matter what its radius is, the charge enclosed is
always <i>Q</i>. The right hand side doesn't vary with <i>Q</i>. The left
hand side looks like r squared times electric field so <i>E</i> goes like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
But now I'm going to do some variations on this. The first variation is what
if I want the electric field at some point here, in here? You're allowed to
ask that. You can take an instrument and put it there and ask what field you
have. You have to calculate that too, so let's calculate it for a sphere. The
formula is the same, same formula. Everything is the same, but <i>Q</i> is now
the charge enclosed. So I'm going to write, again, 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, I'm
sorry, 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) is the charge enclosed
over &#949;<sub>0</sub>. What is the charge enclosed in this sphere, now, which is
a mathematical sphere with radius as little <i>r</i>, but it's smaller than big
<i>R</i>? Can you make a guess? How much charge do you think that is in a
smaller sphere? Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The charge density
times volume.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. So he said it's the charge density times the volume. I'm going to
write down the answer without going through the intermediate step, but it'll
coincide with what he said. The answer I'm going to write down is the total
charge is <i>Q</i> on the whole ball. The charge is proportional to the
volume. Then the volume of this little guy is <i>r<sup>3</sup></i> and the
volume of the big guy big <i>R<sup>3</sup></i>. That's how much charge will be
enclosed. Can you see that? If you take a square, and you take a part of the
square that's inside that's half as big, the area of it will be &frac14;, because
areas go like 1 over the distance squared. Volumes go like 1 over distance cubed.
But we can also do what he just said. You can take the <i>Q</i> divide it by
the volume 4/3<i>&Pi;r<sup>3</sup></i>. That's the density. Then you can
multiply the density by the volume of the little sphere 4/3<i>&Pi; </i>little r
cubed, and all I'm saying is forget these 4 thirds pis. It's just little <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>
over big <i>R<sup>3</sup></i>. Therefore, the electric field now, <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>),
looks like <i>Q </i>over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r</i> divided by <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>.
This is for <i>r</i> &lt; <i>R</i>, is equal to <i>Q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0 </sub></i>(1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>)
for <i>r</i> &gt; <i>R</i>.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Isn't it supposed to
be r cubed ________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Sorry, here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah, down on the
second one.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here you mean? This line?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> No, I mean like on
the line above. You have like <i>r</i> over <i>r</i> cubed.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I have little <i>r </i>cubed over big <i>R</i> cubed.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Right, but no. I
mean the next line.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This is <i>r </i>less than <i>R</i>, <i>r</i> bigger than <i>R</i>.</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>[inaudible]
Oh, gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: </b>Oh,
you mean this 4<i>&Pi;r</i> squared came downstairs? Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Gotcha.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, eternally vigilant, that's good. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What if little <i>r </i>equals
big <i>R</i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Let's ask. What if little <i>r</i> grows up and become big <i>R</i>, right?
We'll find out. What do you expect? You've got to get the same answer at the
field at a certain point no matter how we approached it, right? You'll find
that's true in this formula, because if you put little <i>r</i> equals big <i>R</i>
and big <i>R</i> over big <i>R<sup>3</sup></i> you'll get 1 over big <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>
and this will also give you 1 over big <i>R<sup>2</sup>.</i> These formulas
will match on the surface of this sphere. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> So can you say again
why we can assume that we don't have to do the integral
________________________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Why did I not do the integral?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Why we ________ 4 pi
squared times E of r.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Why do I do that you mean?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti

Right. So the correct way to do it is to really do <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i>, right? If I did
that it'll be fine with you, correct? This is what you're saying I should do,
right? You asked me why I didn't do this integral, why I just wrote 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>,
is that your question? Right. The assumed form for <i>E</i> is the function
that depends on <i>r</i> times unit vector in the radial direction. And since
I surrounded it with this sphere the tiny area vector is also <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>
times the value of the tiny area. In other words, <i>dA</i> and <i>E </i>are
both parallel if the surface is a sphere, right? So when you take the dot
product this will just become <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) times <i>dA</i> times cosine
of 0 which you don't care about. </p>
<p>That's the first
thing. You still have to integrate over this sphere, but <i>E</i> of <i>r</i>
is a constant on this sphere because it depends only on <i>r</i>. So throughout
the whole sphere if it's a constant, it's like the number 19, you just pull it
and then you get <i>E</i> of <i>r</i> times integral <i>dA</i> and that is my 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>.
So in general you have to do an integral, but if you're lucky and the integrand
is a constant then the integral is trivial. So for a charge at the center of
the spherical ball, and if you went to a sphere then the integrant is a
constant. Okay, so this is what you get. If you draw a picture of this it
looks like this. Electric field as the function of <i>r</i> it will grow with <i>r</i>
then it will decline as 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. And here is little <i>r</i>
equals big <i>R</i>. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What if it were
hollow and all the charges were on the outside ________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
We'll come to that. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Why can we ignore
the charge that's outside the small sphere?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Why don't we count it?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Uh-huh, did you
explain that already?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yeah, well it's a very interesting point, right? Suppose you make a hole in
the earth, of if you go deep into the earth. We said if you're outside the
earth the entire ball is pulling you in, but the claim I'm making is if you're
inside the earth, if you're here, only the ball underneath your feet is pulling
you, but not these guys, right? That's the question, why don't they exert a
force, right? Well, Gauss's Law says, no, but we can try to verify that
explicitly. So we are going to do the hollow sphere, but you followed the
solid sphere now? So why is the field getting stronger as you leave the
center, why is it falling like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> once you leave the
sphere? You've got to think about that. Why is it growing when you leave the
origin? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because there is
more charge _________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. The charge you are enclosing grows like r cubed, and the distance from
the center of that charge is r squared which comes downstairs. So as you go
further out inside the ball you are gaining, but once you reach the surface of
the ball and you go further out you're getting more area for Gauss's Law, but
not more charge which is stuck at capital <i>Q</i>. That's why once you leave
the sphere it starts declining, but if you're inside the sphere it increases.
This is also true for the gravitational force. The gravitational force if you
go to the center of the earth and you move away by 1 inch you'll be pulled back
with an extremely weak force that's proportional to the distance from the
center of the earth. Okay, then we come to another question which came up,
which is let's take a hollow sphere. I take a sphere and I scoop a hole in it
and I want the field here. Okay, so if you want the field here you take a
Gauss's Law for a circle like that, or a sphere like that and you'll get <i>E</i>
times 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to 1 over &#949;<sub>0</sub> at times what?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Nothing. So the electric field inside a hollow sphere is 0. In other words,
if you took the earth and you scooped a big hole in the middle you can float.
It won't pull you at all. So inside a hollow sphere there is no electric
field. Even though there's charge everywhere there's no electric field. We
can understand that in some cases, and other cases require a little more
thought. Let me first show you that for a very, very thin shell why that
happens. Once it's true for a very, very thin shell and it doesn't do anything
you can put one shell inside another and make it as thick as you like because 0
is going to be the contribution from each guy. </p>
<p>So let me take a very
thin shell. Here's a very thin shell. So remember, this is not a ball. This
is a shell whose thickness is the thickness of the chalk here. I think you
will agree that at the center of this sphere the force has to be 0. You agree
with that? Because which way should it go? For every guy pushing, say from
here in that direction, there's another one from there pushing in this
direction. They all cancel. It's very clear that at the center you don't feel
a force. But what is truly amazing is that even when you're off center you
don't feel a force. So I'm going to give you the argument for that one,
argument for that namely I'm once again going to pair off canceling charges,
okay? I'm going to cancel one thing against another thing. When you were at
the center you canceled a little charge here with a little charge here, right?
When you are here here's what you do. Take a cone like that. It is not two
lengths. It is a three dimensional cone, but I'm able to show you only a slice
right down the middle, you understand? This is really a cone that'll cut the
sphere there; it'll cut the sphere there. </p>
<p>Take all these guys.
They have a certain charge, which is some charge density which is uniform,
times the area of this thing divided by the square of the distance <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>.
Here, these charges here will push you to the right with a force which is the
area of density, the charge density per unit area times the area of the smaller
circle divided by <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> squared. But now I claim that I can
equate these two. I can equate these two if this area of vector and this area
of vector were radiating outwards, and this is actually a true statement. This
area is proportional to <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> squared. This area is
proportional to <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> squared, therefore they will cancel. But
this is a very subtle argument. Sometimes even textbooks get it wrong. And
generally if you take two cones like this you can see that the area vector
points that way, but the electric field vector points this way. They are not
the same. The area vector, area on the sphere, right, will point in one
direction, but the <i>r</i> vector is different. </p>
<p>So you have to take
the cosine <i>&#952;</i> on both sides, but it turns out cosine <i>&#952;</i> is also the
same because if you took a line and you cut it this way that angle will equal
that angle. So that's a subtly we don't need, but that's how you really prove
for every shell. There's a cancellation. If you know what a solid angle is
it's very easy to say. This is called, with the cosine thetas in it, it's
called a solid angle enclosed by this point, and the two things have the same
solid angle and they cancel. But if you don't want the most complicated proof
you can take points like this where it's clear that this area vector and this
area vector are both perpendicular, and to the radial direction, and therefore
the electric field and this vector are parallel. Then you don't need the
cosine thetas. They are clearly equal at possibly even 1. Then A/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
being the same is the reason it works. </p>
<p>In other words, if
the force of gravity or the electric force did not fall exactly like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
the field inside a hollow sphere will not be 0. So this is how people tested
the 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> force law in the old days. They went inside a
hollow sphere and tried to see if there is any field inside by putting test
charges and finding they don't respond. That's the most reliable way to prove
0 field. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Can you explain
again why the A over r squareds are equal?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Well, you can see that if you took a cone and if you just did similar triangles
you can see that this area is growing like that radius square. It's a matter
of how areas grow when you scale anything. Take a cone, okay, and you slice it
at some point, and slice it even higher. Here's a cone. You slice it there and
you slice it there, and my claim is this area is to that area that distance
squared is to that distance squared. Why is that, right? That's your
question. The area of this cone is something, something radius times
something, something height, right? So you can calculate, if you like. The
radius of this circle and the radius of that circle are growing linearly as you
go out. If you go distance <i>r</i> here, and you get a radius here, if you go
distance <i>r</i> there you get another radius. Is it clear to you that the
radii are proportional to the distance from the center in this cone? </p>
<p>Let me draw it
again. This is a bad picture. Here's my cone. Take two circles. Well again,
I screwed up. This is supposed to be circles. This is the center. That
radius is to that height what this radius is to this height. They're just
similar triangles. Therefore, this height is what I'm calling <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
and this height is what I'm calling <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. Therefore, if this
radius is proportional to <i>r<sub>2</sub> </i>the area of that circle is <i>&Pi;r<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.
This is <i>&Pi;r<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. So that'll go like that distance
squared is to that distance squared. Okay, whenever you scale things for an
area by factor of 2 it'll go like the square of that factor. You can already
see that if you draw these cones this'll intersect the circle, the sphere on
the small circle. This will intercept it on a bigger circle. That much is
clear, but the extra is not linearly proportional.It is quadratic
because the circle has two dimensions both of which are growing linearly with
the distance from the apex of the cone. That's why it's <em>r</em> squared. </p>
<p>All right, another
thing one can calculate is the electric field due
to an infinitely long wire. Here's an infinitely long wire with lambda
coulombs per meter. So you want to find the electric field. By the way, I
should tell you that Gauss's Law--let me do this one example. I'll tell you
what the restriction of Gauss's Law is. So we come to this problem and we can
again argue by symmetry the field lines have to be radially away from the axis
of their line, and if you look at it from the edge, from one edge it'll look
like this. If you look at the wire from the edge the lines should be going out
like that. It's like a hedgehog but it's cylindrical. It's not in all three
dimensions. It's radial in this direction. </p>
<p>And the question is
and the field has to be constant along the length of the infinite wire at each
point at the same distance because if you move the wire horizontally it looks
the same so the field distribution cannot vary. If it is a finite wire you
cannot make the argument. In a finite wire as you come near the edges lines
will start tilting. But a finite wire doesn't look the same when you move it;
an infinite wire does. Therefore, for an infinite wire if you don't stop here
the lines will always look the same, so that if you shift them over they should
look the same. So the only unknown question is: I know the field is in this
direction radially away from the wire in all directions whose magnitude is
fixed at a distance <i>r</i>, but I want to know what the magnitude is. Again,
I'm going to take Gauss's Law and I'm going to apply to the following surface.
Surface is a cylinder and the cylinder has some length <i>l</i>, and it's got
some radius <i>r</i> and the flat faces of the cylinder are parallel, so if you
really want to give the nice picture here they look like this. So Gauss's Law
can be applied only to a closed surface. </p>
<p>You understand that?
You cannot do it for an open surface because only if you trap the charge
completely in all directions will you count every line. If you've got holes in
your surface then stuff can escape and you cannot promise anything. So I need
a closed surface and my closed surface is the cylinder. So I'm going to write,
once again, the surface integral of the electric field on that cylinder is the charge
enclosed. The charge enclosed is the easiest part. I'm going to give you 10
seconds to think in your head. What is a charge enclosed by the cylinder?
Okay? It's charge per unit length times the length of wire trapped inside the
cylinder and then, of course, I have this 1/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. It still is
a statement about the integral of <i>E</i> on the surface, and it could be any
surface, but the beauty of this surface is the following. There are
contributions to <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> from the curvy side
of the cylinder and from the flat side. In the flat side the surface vector,
area vector <i>dA</i> for any small portion, or in fact for the entire face, is
like that. The electric field runs along that face so the dot product is 0. </p>
<p>So I got 0 from the
left side, 0 from the right side, then I got non-zero from the curvy cylinder.
On the curved cylinder you can, I hope, see that every area vector is actually
parallel to the field lines. So just like on a sphere this integral will be E(r)
times the surface of the curvy part of the cylinder which is 2<i>&Pi;r </i>times <i>L</i>.
That's the area of the curved part of the cylinder. So you see <i>L</i>
cancels out, and it better cancel out because <i>L</i> is an artificial
construction. We made up <i>L</i>. The answer should not depend on the
Gaussian surface you picked. I told you it's a figment of our imagination, so
it doesn't depend on it, and we find <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) = &#955;/2<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r</i>,
which is the result we got earlier on by doing all the brute force
integration. Remember we took a point here. We took some segment. We drew
the arrows, did the integrals, sine thetas and whatnot, but you can get that in
one shot. </p>
<p>So it looks like
Gauss's Law is the easy way to do stuff, and you may wonder why we bother to do
any difficult integrals. The reason is that if I change the symmetry of the
problem in the slightest way I cannot calculate the field. For example, if on
the spherical charge distribution instead of a sphere I made a little blip
here, maybe did a little surgery and put that guy here. We're dead. I mean,
there's a formula for the field, but no one can calculate it in any simple
way. You can, again, take a Gaussian surface and it'll still be true that the
integral of the electric field on that surface will be the same <i>Q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>,
but the problem is the <i>E</i> on the surface is no longer constant. You understand?
Not every point is symmetric any more. <i>E</i> may be stronger where there's
a bulge. <i>E</i> may be weaker where there is hole, so and also its direction
is changing in a crazy way. So you can make one true statement about the
integral of that crazy function over the whole region. That cannot be used to
deduce the value of <i>E</i> at every point. So you still need the integral. You may have to do
the integral maybe on a computer, but that's the answer to all problems, but
for simple problems with a great deal of symmetry we can use Gauss's Law to get
these things very easily, okay? That's the Gauss. </p>
<p>Now, I'm going to
introduce you to a second notion which is pretty important to study
electricity, and that's the notion of conductors. So we're going to divide the
world into two things, conductors and insulators. As you know, matter is made
up of positive and negative charges and the negative charges circle the
positive charges, and they pretty much stay near their parent atoms, near the
parent nuclei, and you cannot separate them. But in a metal at least some of
the electrons from each atom become communal. In other words, they can run
around the whole solid. They don't belong to any one nucleus. So that's a
conductor. In a conductor the negative charges, if you like, are free to
move. So here's the first result. <i>E</i> is equal to 0 inside a conductor.
</p>
<p>That really follows
from the meaning of the word conductor. If you took a chunk of perfect
conductor, maybe copper is good enough; they'll be no electric field inside
copper. Why? Because if this is the chunk of material, this electric field,
then the charges that I said are free to move will respond to the electric
field and they'll be moving. So I should say <i>E</i> equal to 0 inside a
conductor in a static situation. In other words, once the charges have stopped
moving the electric field will be 0 in a conductor. Let me explain to you a
little more what's going on so it's not a big mystery. </p>
<p>Suppose there is a
uniform electric field going from left to right? In that uniform field I take
a chunk of copper like a nice rectangular chunk and I stick it in there. What
will happen? In the beginning the electric field will penetrate the copper and
the field lines say to the positive charges, &quot;You go to the right,&quot;
and to the negative charges, &quot;You go to the left.&quot; Negative charges
will race to the left until they cannot go anymore without leaving the solid,
and that they're not allowed to do, leaving behind some deficit on the other
side. But look what's happening now. These guys produce their own electric
field which goes from here to here. </p>
<p>Therefore, inside the
conductor, the electric field by the superposition principle is the field due
to whatever outside agency produced this field, plus the field due to these
guys, and they will not stop until the field they produced exactly cancels the
external field. Then the migration will stop. So how do they know when to
stop? They are not that smart, right? But the point is once they've produced
the potential, I mean, once they produce the field that cancels the external
field there'll be no field inside the bulk to encourage charges to move any
more and that's when they stop moving. Okay, so a conductor, at least in this
case, not so hard to understand what they have to do. Negative charges go to
one side. Positive go to the other side until the field they produce is an
arrow going to the left of the same magnitude as this one then <i>E</i> is 0
inside. </p>
<p>But what's amazing
about these metals is that if you take a potato shaped metal it's not so easy
to see what charge arrangement will exactly neutralize the field everywhere in
sight. Here it's easy to see. I want a right moving one canceled with a left
moving one. I draw a line, a plane of charges here and here, and you can see
they will cancel. But even this oddball object, I claim, will eventually
acquire some density of charges, they're not uniform or anything, in some
complicated fashion until the field inside the solid becomes 0. So these
particles will always figure out a way to make the field 0 inside, because it's
the definition. If it's not 0 they've got more work to do, and the charges
have to separate even more until there is no hunger for the separation because
they managed to produce a field inside that is 0. Then nobody else will join
this flow and it'll stop. </p>
<p>So that's a very
short period, 10 to the minus something, when charges rearrange when you put a
conductor in the field, then quickly it'll stop. If you put an alternating
field going back and forth then, of course, it depends on how rapidly it's
oscillating, and charges may not be able to keep up with that. That's called a
plasma frequency, and beyond that a field would start penetrating because
charges cannot keep in step. But a DC field, where you've got all the time in
the world to settle down, they will very quickly come to this arrangement.
They will stop. So remember field in a conductor is 0 by definition. </p>
<p>Okay, now the next
thing I will show you is that charge inside a conductor equal to 0. By that I
mean the following. If you took a conductor and you threw some charge on it
where will it go? Okay, here's a chunk of copper. Throw 10 million
electrons. Well, the 10 million electrons don't like each other. They will
try to run away from each other. </p>
<p>In the end they will
all sit somewhere here, but they will sit in such a way that the field inside
is 0, because you cannot have an electric field. If the electric field is 0
everywhere then the charge is also 0 everywhere, because you can take any
surface, any volume you like with the integral of <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i>, you're going to get
0. If you can get <i>E</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> is 0 for every
possible surface then the charge enclosed by every possible surface is 0,
therefore there is no charge in sight. So where does the charge go? It goes
to the boundary of the metal. Once they're at the boundary of the metal the
metal starts calling you back because there is something called a work
function. It's like all the electrons in a swimming pool. If they don't like
each other they can go to the edge of the pool, but to leave the pool they've
got to climb up over the vertical walls, and they cannot scale the walls. If
you rip them hard enough they will. If you put enough charges, charges will
start flying from here and maybe land there; that we call lightening. For that
they'll have to break the air and produce a conducting path, but if you don't
put such strong fields the charges will remain on the surface. </p>
<p>Now, it turns out we
can actually relate the electric field at the surface to the charge density of
the surface by a following trick. Let's go to the surface here and ask,
&quot;What's the electric field? Which way can it point?&quot; I claim the
electric field can only point perpendicular to the surface, because if you had
parallel components then the charges can move along the surface. No one says
you cannot run it on the edge of the swimming pool, you just cannot leave it.
So the electric field lines must point radial, I mean, normal to the surface.
And I claim that we can actually calculate the electric field here if you knew
the charge density here. So let's do that. So here's some surface, and I
have--take a tiny region here and I'm going to take a Gaussian surface that
looks like this. It's a cylinder, very tiny cylinder, and the field lines are
like that there. There is no field lines here because there's no field
inside. And the field here all of these things are 0, and the field here is
parallel to the cylinder so it doesn't contribute. </p>
<p>You see that? I got
a cylinder. I rammed it into this solid. It's a mathematical Gaussian
surface. It's got following faces, flat face, no <i>E</i> because there's
nothing inside the metal, this part of the curvy-face, no <i>E</i>, nothing
inside the metal. Here <i>E</i> is parallel to the sides of the cylinder, so
there's no flux. The top end, if the area's <i>A</i> or <i>dA</i>, the top end
will have a flux which will be the <i>E</i> that I'm trying to calculate times <i>dA</i>.
That's going to be equal to the charge enclosed is &#963;<i>dA</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>,
because &#963; is the charge density which I assume I'm given. Then you can see the
<i>dA</i> cancels. The electric field is &#963;/&#949;<sub>0</sub>. Do you remember
ever seeing a formula like this sigma or anything like this? Yes? </p>
<p>Okay. Let me remind
you where you saw it. I showed you that if you took an infinite plane of
charge density &#963; the electric field was &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>, and I did that with a
long calculation. I took a point there. I took rings and so on. Now, you
don't have to do that. Let's use Gauss's Law again to calculate it. Once
again, you argue that if you're in front of an infinite plane the only
distribution of field lines that makes sense is if the field line's always
perpendicular to the surface. They can get weaker as you go away, but at a
given distance from the plane they should have the same value, because if you
slide the plane up and down it shouldn't matter. So let's take the side view
of the plane. There are your charges. And I'm going to take a Gaussian
cylinder that looks like this. The field lines are going like that. They're
going like that. There is some charge trapped here. And the area of that guy
is some <i>dA</i>. </p>
<p>So again, I apply
Gauss's Law here. Of the cylinder I got the curvy sides with no contribution,
because the field is parallel to the curvy side. I got the flat faces. So I
get <i>E</i> times <i>dA</i> for one of them, and <i>E</i> times <i>dA</i> for
the other one, because both are outgoing. That is equal to charge enclosed
with the &#963; times <i>dA</i> divided by &#949;<sub>0</sub>. If you cancel the <i>dA</i>
you find <i>E</i> is &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>. So the electric field on either side of
the plane is &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>. You just get it from Gauss's Law. Again,
there's no reason to do the complicated integral. That's because we've reduced
everything to one unknown, namely what was the magnitude of the electric field
at a certain distance from the plane? Direction is known to be perpendicular
and to be constant on this line. Then the one number came out to be, in fact,
independent of how far you are. But now go back to the conductor. If you go
back to the conductor you find the field at the surface of a conductor is &#963;/&#949;<sub>0</sub>
where &#963; is the charge density there, whereas for an infinite plane it's &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>
on either side. </p>
<p>And you can ask,
what's going on? Why is it &#963;/&#949;<sub>0</sub>? Can anybody guess what may be
happening? In other words, if you take a tiny area on a conductor and you go
very, very, very close it should be as if you're next to an infinite plane,
because if you're very, very close to the surface you don't know if it's finite
or infinite. So you should get the same answer as for the infinite plane.
Therefore, if you took only the charge sitting there it should give you &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>
going out and &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub> going in. In other words, let me draw a picture
here. That's my tiny area. I expect the field due to just the charge there to
be like this, &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>, and &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>. But that is not the
whole story because I've got the rest of the conductor that's got its own
charge. It is going to produce a field. </p>
<p>That field will have
some value, and I claim I know the value of that field. It'll be precisely
enough to cancel it on the inside, but if you cancel it on the inside you'll
double it on the outside because it's got &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub> pointing outwards to
cancel this guy, but then it'll aid the one due to the little area by doubling
it. That's why it's &#963;/&#949;<sub>0</sub> outside and 0 inside. In other words,
here is the full story. If you go to a conductor, if you pick a region here,
the field at this point is due to what's here and what is everywhere else.
What is here does that as if it was an infinite plane. The rest of the guys
do that and that cancels this here, but adds there, so you can see more &#949;<sub>0</sub>
outside. </p>
<p>Okay, then there are
other variations to this theme. So here's a conductor, and I make a hole in
it, and I put some charge. You can ask if I throw some charge on it where will
it sit. Well, some charges will sit here if you put some coulombs, but what
will happen on the inner wall? This is a hole. The claim is that there'll be
no charges here. They'll all be outside even though you've got a hole in the
middle. Again, Gauss's Law tells you why. If I take a surface like this and
do Gauss's Law, since the electric field is 0 inside the metal, <i>Q</i>
enclosed is 0. So the <i>Q </i>that's enclosed, which is 0, means that maybe
some positive guys and some negative guys, but there's nothing from stopping
the positive guys from rushing to meet the negative guys and canceling. They
will, for there is no reason they just stay on opposite sides of the island.
They'll just come together. Therefore, there is
no stable equilibrium in which the charges will be ever inside a conductor. So
if you have a conductor and you put charge on it, it goes to the surface even
if there are holes inside the conductor. </p>
<p>Now, that's a very
interesting paradox. I showed you that the field inside a conductor even if
there's a hole is 0, but let's ask the following question. I take a conductor
with the hole in it and I put a charge <i>q</i> here. Will you know about it
from the outside? You're not allowed to enter it. Will you know from the
outside there's a charge inside or will it get also shielded? Will there be
any flux lines coming out here? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Because there's a
charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti

Right. If there are no field lines here, and I do Gauss's Law on this surface,
if the surface integral of <i>E</i> is 0 <i>q<sub>enclosed</sub></i> is 0, but
I know there is some <i>q</i> inside. So what's going to happen? I want the
field lines to be present here and absent here. So what'll happen is if you
put a +<i>q</i> here the material conductor will separate into -<i>q</i>'s
where these lines can terminate, and then out here will be some compensating
plus charges that'll produce the field that'll produce the lines going out. In
other words, this is really like a chunk of copper I showed you where it
screens the field by polarizing into a negative part in this wall and positive
contribution in the outer wall so that inside there is no field. Okay, so
these are different variations of this theme and you should be able to do a
whole bunch of problems connected with that. </p>
<p>Okay, I've used up my
board, so I think I'll give you guys a five minute tour on how to do these
integrals in case it ever comes up. I'm just going to do two very trivial
integrals and stop, and I'm going to do them in two dimensions and you can
worry about higher dimensions. It's just generalization. Suppose you're in the
<i>xy</i> plane and there's a function in the <i>xy</i> plane, f (x, y), and
someone says find f (x,y) dx dy. What's the procedure and what are you
supposed to do is the question. What you do in Cartesian coordinates is you
take a line <i>y</i> equal to something, <i>y</i> equal to something + <i>delta
y</i>, <i>x</i> equal to something, <i>x </i>equal to something + <i>delta x</i>,
and that region (bounded) by these contours of constant <i>x</i> at different
values and constant <i>y</i> at different values, has an area <i>dxdy</i>. </p>
<p>You multiply that
area by this function. This could be the number of people living per square
mile and this could be the number of square miles, and you add up all the
little squares over the area that was given to you. So whoever tells you to do
integrals better tell you over what range you're going to do that integral.
Okay? So let's find out the area for triangle by this process. Here's a
triangle. Let's say there's one here and one here, 0, 1; 1, 0. This is <i>y</i>.
This is <i>x</i>. I want to find the area of the triangle. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Isn't that point 1,
1? </p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar</b>:
Yes, thank you. That point is 1, 1. You're supposed to take <i>dxdy</i> you
write it like this. There's no function or integral. I just want 1 times <i>dxdy</i>,
so the 1 is implicit. <i>dy</i>, you pick a certain <i>x</i> and <i>y </i>should
go from here to here. The range of <i>y </i>is clearly 1 - <i>x</i> because
this is a curve <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> = 1. So <i>y</i> goes from 0 to 1 - <i>x</i>,
and for every choice of <i>x</i>, <i>x</i> goes from 0 to 1. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Isn't the line
defined as y = x ________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is the line
________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, let me see. No, no. This is not the equation of the line. This height
here is equal to 1 - <i>x</i>. Oh, you think that's wrong?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible].</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The height of <i>y</i>, isn't there 1 - <i>x</i>?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Or it's just <i>x</i>. I'm sorry. Okay, caught on tape. Very good. All
right, so here is <i>x</i>, goes up to <i>x </i>and the <i>y</i> integral you
do it as lower limit, upper limit gives you an <i>x</i> and <i>x </i>goes from
0 to 1. That gives you <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2 from 0 to 1. That gives you 1
over 2. If you had a function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> you wanted to
integrate, in other words instead of just the number one, if you had a function
of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> the rule is the following. You put the function here,
and put <i>x</i> equal to a fixed value, don't take it as a variable, and treat
<i>y</i> as a variable and do <i>dy</i> from this limit to this limit. When
you are done you will get some mass that depends only on <i>x</i> that you
integrate from 0 to 1. </p>
<p>But the final thing
I'm going to do is to do the same integral in polar coordinates, area of a
triangle in polar coordinates looks like this. In polar coordinates, as you
know, you draw circles of <i>r </i>and <i>r</i> + <i>dr</i>, and lines at <i>&#952;</i>
and <i>&#952;</i> + <i>d&#952;</i>, and this shaded region here has got one side equal to
<i>rd&#952; </i>and the other side equal to <i>dr</i>. </p>
<p>So area integral will
look like <i>rdrd&#952;</i> times some function of <i>r</i> and <i>&#952;</i> over the
allowed region, but I want to do now a triangle of height 1 and base 1. Here's
what I do. I'm going to pick theta first and hold it fixed, and theta will go
from 0 to &Pi;/4. Can you see that? This is supposed to be a square. Theta goes
from 0 to <i>&Pi;/</i>4, and I have <i>rdr</i>. What is the range of <i>r</i>?
How far is this thing? You can see that if this angle is theta then <i>r</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>
is 1, and for <i>r</i> is 1/cos<i>&#952;</i>. So <i>r dr</i> is really <i>d</i> of <i>r</i>
squared. <i>d</i> of <i>r </i>squared is equal to <i>d </i>of 1/cos<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>,
right? I mean, let me do it this way. <i>d</i> of <i>r</i> squared is r<sup>2</sup>/2
from 1/cos<i>&#952; </i>to 0. So that gives me 1/2 integral <i>d&#952; </i>0 to &Pi;/4 of 1/cos<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>.
</p>
<p>Well, you may not
know this, but sec<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i> is the derivative of tan<i>&#952;</i>. So
derivative of integral of tan<i>&#952;</i> will turn out to be simply tan<i>&#952; </i>calculated
between &Pi;/4 and 0. That'll be just 1. So you're not supposed to follow at
lightening speed this integral, okay? Either you've seen it before or if you
need some help you can look at my math book I mentioned to you. All I'm trying
to tell you here is if when you have multiple integrals you pick one coordinate
and you freeze it, for example, <i>x</i> when you integrate to the other
coordinate over the allowed region that keeps you in the boundary then
integrate over the second variable. You may need that, but for most of the
problems I've given you won't have to do that. They're pretty simple.</p>
