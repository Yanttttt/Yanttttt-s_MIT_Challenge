<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay. I have to start right away
without any preamble because I think I want to go back a little bit to
stuff that was done near the end of lecture last time, and maybe go
over some of it one more time. It doesn't hurt.</p>

<p>Okay, so what problem were we trying to solve? We were trying to
solve the problem of masses, coupled to springs, and acted upon by
various forces. And the equation that we need is the following [writes
equation on the board]. So, this is the most general problem we looked
at. This is <i>F<sub>0</sub></i>. I might have just called it <i>F</i>
last time. It doesn't matter; it's a matter of this symbols, okay?
Alright. Let us first divide everything by <i>m</i>. Divide everything
by <i>m</i>, then it becomes <i>x</i> double dot, plus <i>γx</i> dot,
plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x</i>, equals <i>F<sub>0</sub></i>
over <i>m</i>, <i>cos</i> <i>ωt</i>. I'm using the fact that
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> was defined as the root of <i>k</i> over <i>n</i>.
We used to call it <i>ω</i>, but now I'm calling it
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>, and you should understand why I'm doing that,
because there are now two <i>ω</i>s in the problem. There is, the
<i>ω</i> of the driving force, so you should imagine an oscillatory
force grabbing this mass and moving it back and forth.
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> is the natural frequency of the mass. If you pull
the spring and let it go, that's the frequency that it will vibrate.
There are really the natural frequency that is fixed by <i>k</i> and
<i>m</i> and <i>ω</i> is for you to decide. You can decide to apply to
it any force you like of any frequency.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> So first, take the easy case in
which the right-hand side is 0. No driving force. So, I'm saying let's
consider a simple case, <i>F<sub>0</sub></i>, or <i>F</i>, the applied
force vanishes. That's the problem I spent a considerable amount of
time on yesterday. You can say, "Well, if there's no driving force, why
does anything move?" That's actually correct. If you took a mass in a
spring and didn't do anything to it, the solution of this equation is
<i>x</i> = 0, and that is fine. But it also has interesting non-trivial
solutions because you can pull the mass and then let it go. After you
let it go, there are no forces on the system except the force of
friction and the force of the spring, and that is this problem. Now,
how do you solve this problem? I told you the way you solve this
problem is you make a guess: <i>x</i> of <i>t</i> is some number,
<i>A</i> times <i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i>. See if it'll work. And you
find it will work and you can do this in your head. I certainly don't
want to repeat all of that. The reason it's going to work is that every
time you take derivative of <i>x</i>, you bring down an <i>α</i>, and
still keep <i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i>. So, when you put that guess into
this equation, you're going to get <i>α<sup>2</sup></i> plus <i>γα</i>,
plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square times <i>A</i>, <i>e</i> to the
<i>αt</i> equal to 0. And if this is going to vanish, it's not because
of <i>A</i> and it's not because of the <i>αt</i>, it's because this
guy in brackets is going to vanish. So, when that's 0, you all
recognize this to be a quadratic equation. You go back to your days in
the sand box [earlier in the course or your life] when you all knew
what the answer to this is; the answer to this is minus <i>γ</i> over
two, plus or minus <i>γ</i> over two square, minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>
square. These are the roots.</p>

<p>Now here, you have to look at--So anyway, what does this mean? This
means that yes, you can find a solution to this equation that looks
like <i>A</i> to the <i>αt</i>; <i>A</i> can be any number you like. No
restriction is placed on <i>A</i>. But <i>α</i> cannot be any number
you like. <i>α</i> has to be the solution to this quadratic equation
and there are two solutions. So, you can call them <i>α</i> plus and
<i>α</i> minus. That's when I branched off into two different cases.
Case one, you can see look, many of the quadratic equations, you know
the way it's going to fall out is depending on whether the stuff inside
the bracket is positive or negative. So, let's take the easier case
when it's positive, that means <i>γ</i> over two is bigger than
<i>ω<sub>0</sub>n</i>. <i>γ</i>, you remember, is the force of friction
so we want it to be not only non-zero, but bigger than this amount
controlled by the natural frequency. In that case, let's not go into
details, but you can all see you put whatever value you have for
<i>γ</i>, the square root of this is some number. The whole thing is
going to be two real choices you get. One will be minus <i>γ</i> over
2, plus whatever is inside the square root. The other will be minus
<i>γ</i> over 2, minus what you have in the square root. The only thing
I want you to notice is that both these roots are negative. This guy's
obviously negative because it's a minus <i>γ</i> over 2 minus something
else, that's definitely negative. You have a little [inaudible] worried
[inaudible] here, that this is minus <i>γ</i> over two and this is plus
something. But the plus something is smaller than the minus something,
because what's inside the square root is <i>γ</i> over 2 square. If you
took the square root of that you'll get exactly <i>γ</i> over 2. But
you're taking away from it, this number; therefore, this square root is
smaller than this number, so the overall thing will still come out
negative. So, why am I so eager that it should come out negative? Why
am I eager that the root should be negative? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, even if I had positive, if I
took two derivatives, it would work out. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Because if alpha is greater than one, then the
<i>e</i> won't converge to cosine<b>.</b></p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Won't converge to what?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The cosine function?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> This is not a cosine function.
This is never going to be. A cosine function is related to <i>e</i> to
the <i>iωt</i> or <i>e</i> to <i>ix</i>. These are all real
exponentials, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> If alpha is positive <i>t</i> goes up
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, that's our main problem.
When you write exponential function--;Usually, people write
exponentials like this, for population growth. Everyone says our
problems are increasing exponentially, they always think of
exponentials as rising. Of course, it's also possible that if <i>α</i>
were a negative number, you could write it as <i>A</i> times the
absolute value of <i>α</i> just to show you it's a falling exponential.
And we have a stomach only for falling exponentials. You've got to
think if I pull this mass and I let it go, I expect <i>x</i> to go down
from whatever value I have, not to keep growing indefinitely. That
doesn't make any physical sense. And one of the great things about the
union of mathematics and physics is the equation automatically works
out that way. It gives you an answer that makes sense.</p>

<p>Okay, so what you get then is a solution that looks like this. One
number <i>A</i> times <i>e</i> to one of the roots plus another number,
<i>B</i>, times <i>e</i> to the other root. I wrote them--they're both
<i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i>, but I write it as minus the absolute value
so you can all see they're falling exponentials. You understand if a
number is negative, like negative five, that can be written as minus
one times the absolute value of the number. So, it is <i>e</i> to the
the <i>αt</i>, but I want to write it in this form, so it's falling.
So, this is a case where if you pull the mass and you let it go, it
will just relax eventually coming to <i>x</i> = 0, which is its normal
equilibrium location.</p>

<p>Now, how about the numbers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>? Right now, they're
completely arbitrary. And another thing you guys should know by now is
how we find <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. In order to find <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, we need to be given more information other than simply the
mass and the spring constant. They're all sitting here, and the
friction coefficient, but that's not enough to tell you what it does on
a given day. It wants to know, well, yes, it's the mass, there's that
the spring, but did you pull it or did you release it in this way or
that way? That's what controls the answer. They're called initial
conditions. One initial condition is what was the value of <i>x</i> at
time, <i>t</i> = 0? That's asking you how much you pulled it when you
let it go. The other initial condition is, what is the velocity?
Namely, the derivative of <i>x</i> at time 0. Most of the time, what
you will find as you pull the mass and release it, then it's got a
non-0 <i>x</i> and a 0 velocity. But it doesn't have to be that way
because I could have pulled it and released it at <i>t</i> = 0,
starting to move inwards, and that's when you jump in and you set your
clocks to 0. Well at that instant, <i>x</i> has a value and the
velocity also has a non-0 value. They don't all have to be 0, but they
are some two numbers that you can pick at will. You can see that if I
put <i>t</i> = 0, I'm going to get <i>A</i> times <i>e</i> to the 0,
which is one. I'm going to get <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> is <i>x</i>(0).
That's one condition on <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. I will take a
derivative, namely, find the velocity, then put <i>T</i> = 0, and set
that equal to some pre-assigned number, you'll get a second equation
for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and we all know we can solve those two
equations to find <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. That's how you fit these three
parameters to the solution tailor-made for that particular
situation.</p>

<p>You should also ask another question. Why is it that I can pick
these numbers, <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>, but why
not keep going? Maybe they're the acceleration of times 0 is some
number. Why is that not up to me to decide? Can anyone tell me why
that's not negotiable? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Depends upon what? Can I pick
the acceleration of a body at will? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, I'm not sure I heard the
exact answer but it sounds close enough to what I had in mind, which is
Newton will tell you what the acceleration of a body is, namely mass
times acceleration is the force, and the force, once it's given in any
given problem, which is given by where the body is, and what the
velocity is in this example, you have no choice on what the
acceleration is. But initial position and velocity are not given by
Newton's law. Newton's law says, if the force is so and so, the
acceleration is so and so, but he doesn't tell you what should be the
velocity at a given time, what should be the position at a given time.
That's why they are two free numbers, that's why you have an answer
with two free numbers that you can pick to bring it in accord with
these two numbers.</p>

<p>Okay, this solution to the equation with <i>F</i> = 0 from now on,
I'm going to call <i>x<sub>c</sub></i>, where <i>c</i> stands for the
complimentary function. Now, there's another thing that could have
happened here, which is in fact another alternative. You can think
about what I'm saying. The other alternative is when this <i>γ</i> over
2 is smaller than this <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. Then, of course, you have
the square root of a negative number. So, then you go back to the stage
where you're finding the root, and you say <i>α</i> equals minus
<i>γ</i> over two, plus or minus the square root of <i>γ</i> over
two<sup>2</sup> minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, but that number
is negative. So, that can be returned as a negative sign, times the
square root of this number, and the square root of minus one will come
out as an <i>i</i> out front. So, either you will get two real roots,
this is a mathematical result, it has nothing to do with physics, a
quadratic equation with real coefficients either will have two real
roots, or it will have two roots which are complex conjugates of each
other. You learned the notion of complex conjugation, which is to
exchange <i>i</i> to minus <i>i</i>, you can see the <i>α</i> plus and
<i>α</i> minus have the same real part, minus <i>γ</i> over 2, and have
opposite imaginary parts. So, in this example, <i>α</i> plus is the
complex conjugate of <i>α</i> minus and I've told you this relationship
works both ways; therefore, <i>α</i> minus is a complex conjugate of
<i>α</i> plus.</p>

<p>So, what's the solution going to look like? It's going to look like
<i>Ae</i> to the minus <i>γt</i> over two, <i>e</i> to the <i>iω</i>
prime <i>t</i>, but I'm going to call this fellow in brackets as
<i>ω</i> prime. Then, there's the second solution. The real part is
exactly the same, the imaginary part is opposite, minus <i>iω</i> prime
<i>t</i>. <i>ω</i> prime is a new frequency connected to the natural
frequency and the frictional force. That's why, we've got three
<i>ω</i>s. We've got to keep that in mind. <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> is a
natural frequency of vibration. If I have a driving force, I reserve
the symbol <i>ω</i> for the frequency of the driving force. Here is yet
another quantity with units of frequency which I'm calling <i>ω</i>
prime. So, what does this guy look like? But first of all, it's full of
complex numbers and we don't like it. We know the oscillator should
have a real coordinate, so you ask, I've not picked <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> yet, how shall I pick them so that <i>x</i> is real? Well,
forget A and <i>B</i> for a minute and look at this number and this
number. Do you guys realize that they're complex conjugates of each
other, because <i>i</i> has gone to minus <i>i</i>. So for example, if
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were equal numbers, this would be a real number
because number plus its conjugate, you killed imaginary part because
they have opposite imaginary parts. So, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> real [and
equal as stated above] is a good answer, but it's too restrictive. All
we will demand is that if <i>A</i> looks like absolute value of
<i>A</i> times <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i>, B should look like the
absolute value of <i>A</i> times e to the minus <i>iφ</i>. In other
words, <i>B</i> should be the complex conjugate of <i>A</i>. That means
the same absolute value, but opposite phase. I remind you, in the
complex plane, if a number <i>z</i> is sitting there, the complex
conjugate is sitting here, they have opposite angles, <i>φ</i>.</p>

<p>So, if you do that, then you get <i>A</i> absolute value, <i>e</i>
to the minus <i>γ</i> over two, times <i>e</i> to the <i>iω</i> prime
<i>t</i> plus <i>φ</i>, plus <i>e</i> to the minus <i>iω</i> prime
<i>t</i> plus <i>φ</i>. Now we have made it real. <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, both being fully real means this <i>φ</i> is 0, but you see
<i>φ</i> doesn't really have to be 0. That is too much of a
restriction. <i>φ</i> can be whatever you like provided the <i>φ</i>
that <i>A</i> has, the phase that <i>A</i> has, is the same
[correction: should have said "minus"] the phase that <i>B</i> has.
That means the angle in the complex plane of the number <i>A</i> and
the number <i>B</i> have to be opposite of each other. This, you guys
should know what it is. I've told you many times. This is unforgivable
if you don't know what this is. <i>e</i> to <i>iθ</i>, plus <i>e</i> to
the minus <i>iθ</i> over two, is <i>cos θ</i>. Since you don't have the
over two, you can write it as 2<i>A</i>, <i>e</i> to the minus <i>γ</i>
over two, cosine of whatever is in here, <i>ω</i> prime <i>t</i> plus
<i>φ</i>.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm going to change my notation a little bit in view
of what's to come. Instead of calling this <i>φ</i>, I'm going to call
it <i>φ</i><sub>0</sub>. Alright, because another <i>φ</i> is going to
come in and I want to separate those two. So, two times <i>A</i> is a
new number, I'm going to call that <i>C</i>, and this is the bottom
line. The answer looks like <i>e</i> to the minus <i>γt</i> over two,
<i>cos ω</i> prime <i>t</i> plus <i>φ</i><sub>0</sub>. So, we had done
all this yesterday. I've given you the notes, but I want you to
understand where we're going with all of this. If you pull a mass and
let it go, it turns out there are two things that can happen. I really
wish I had time to bring you these different masses and show you. If
you have no friction, everyone knows what's going to happen. You pull
the mass and let it go; it oscillates forever. In real life, there's
always some friction, so let's turn on a little friction. What'll
happen is what's very familiar and expected. We start with an amplitude
of five, go to four, go to three, go to two, rock back and forth and
slowly it may wiggle around but you won't be able to see it. That's
called a damped oscillation. That's really what's described by this
solution. Here, it looks like a cosine of something, but the number in
front of it itself is falling with time. And the picture for that will
look like the following: if you just draw an exponentially falling
function as your amplitude, and you multiply that by an oscillating
cosine it will do this. This is a damped oscillation.</p>

<p>But another extreme case which you may not think about is, if you
crank up the friction more, ‘till <i>γ</i> over two is bigger than
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>, then what happens is if you pull the mass and let
it go, it doesn't even go to the other side of <i>x</i> = 0. It just
slowly gets to 0, in an infinite amount of time, you understand? If you
pull it from here, you let it go. No friction is this [moving hand back
and forth] for eternity. Small amount of friction has slowly damped the
oscillation. Too much of friction, you come back slowly and you come to
rest. These are different cases and the mathematics tells you the
different cases so that's what we like about the union of mathematics
and physics. Once you wrote down the basic law of Newton, you have no
choice as to where it takes you. You go where it takes, and these are
the different solutions.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is what I did earlier on in the day. But now, let's go
back to the more general problem I had, which is a right-hand side
which, is not 0. So, let's write the right-hand side which is not zero
as <i>x</i> double dot, plus <i>γx</i> dot, plus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x</i>, equals <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over
<i>m</i>, <i>cos</i> <i>ωt</i>. This is called a driven oscillator.
Driven oscillators are present all the time. For example, if you have a
swing, the swing goes back and forth. You may choose to push the swing
back and forth. If you've got a kid in a park, you're applying a force
which is an oscillating force. Whereas in the absence of external
forces, all oscillations will eventually die down. Do you guys
understand that? Why? Why do all oscillations die down in the absence
of external forces?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Friction?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, well in this case, it's
not air resistance, but friction. But what friction does is that in the
presence of friction, you cannot prove the Law of Conservation of
Energy. We saw that. Whenever friction acts, the energy total
mechanical energy goes down. So, kinetic plus potential will decrease
with time so the oscillations get damped. But if you are pushing it
from outside, you can provide a constant source of energy so you can
maintain a steady oscillation, and that's the problem we're looking at.
That is this problem.</p>

<p>So, how did we solve this problem? Well, I said I don't want to
solve this equation. I'm going to manufacture another problem. <i>z</i>
double dot, plus <i>γ</i> times <i>z</i> dot, plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>
square <i>z</i>, is <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the
<i>iωt</i>. So, let's be very clear. This is a real physics problem
that occurs all the time. This [pointing to other equation] is clearly
not of our world, because in our world you don't have a force, <i>e</i>
to the <i>iωt</i>. All forces in the real world are real. So, this is a
complex force. If you break down the <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, you
all know it's <i>cos</i> <i>ωt</i>, which I like, plus <i>i sin ωt</i>,
which I don't like. I'm solving a problem in which on top of the force
I'm really applying, there's an imaginary force put on top of it.</p>

<p>So, what is the strategy? Why have we taken the problem and making
it worse than it is? Because we have a strategy and the strategy is the
following. If you have right-hand side <i>cos ωt</i>, ask yourself what
you're trying to do. You're looking for some function <i>x(t)</i>,
which will obey this equation. You can try various functions, maybe
<i>x</i> is a cosine of time. If it's a cosine of time, two derivatives
will be a cosine. No derivative will be a sine. One derivative
will--I'm sorry, no derivative will be cosine, one derivative will be a
sine. So, you cannot make it into a cosine. If you took a sine, the
middle guy will look like a cosine. You can try to balance that against
this; the end two terms look like cosine, so neither sin nor a cosine
works. It turns out something in between will work. But something that
always works is the following. If the right-hand side, instead of being
<i>cos ωt</i>, was <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, you can guess the answer
immediately. Namely <i>z</i> itself will behave like <i>e</i> to the
<i>iωt</i>, because then if I take two derivatives, that's going to
look like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, times some numbers, that's going
to look like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, that's going to look like
<i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>. So, the beauty of the exponential is when
you take derivatives you keep getting the exponential.</p>

<p>Okay, but now, the problem is this is not the problem. No one told
you to solve this problem, but our strategy is the following. The
right-hand side has got a real force and imaginary force. The real
force will produce the <i>x</i> that I want. The imaginary force,
purely imaginary, <i>i</i> times <i>sin</i> <i>ωt</i>, will produce a
purely imaginary answer. So, at the end of the day, I will find the
answer and keep only the real part. That's the plan. That's going to be
the strategy, so that this <i>z</i>, this <i>z</i> is going to be the
<i>x</i> that I want and, will have a part hanging around, <i>y</i>,
that I don't want, but <i>y</i> is being driven by the <i>sin</i>
<i>ωt</i>. And <i>x</i> is being driven by the <i>cos ωt</i>.</p>

<p>But now, let's solve it by inspection. So, let's make a guess that
<i>z</i> looks like some number <i>z<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>e</i> to the
<i>iωt</i>. Now, it's very easy to take derivatives of exponential.
Just pull down <i>iω</i> every time you see a derivative. So, <i>z</i>
double dot will become <i>iω</i> square, which is minus <i>ω</i>
square. <i>z</i> dot will become <i>iω</i>, there's a <i>γ</i> there,
and <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> is just multiplying by a number.
So, this is what I get on the left-hand side, and I want it to equal
this on the right-hand side. And you're almost there because the time
dependence of the two sides are identical, so you can cancel it and
what you find is, yes, I can satisfy the equation that's given to me,
provide the number <i>z<sub>0</sub></i>, the number in front of it will
obey condition. That's trivially solved, because we all know how to get
the solution to that one. <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> is obtained by dividing
both sides by everything that multiplies <i>z<sub>0</sub></i>, which
happens to be <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> minus <i>ω</i> square
plus <i>iωγ</i>.</p>

<p>So, the beautiful property of the exponential function is that you
take what is a differential equation and you turn it into an algebraic
equation. Because the act of taking derivatives generally is a nasty
operation. Sines become cosines, <i>x</i> cubed, becomes three <i>x</i>
square. But exponential remains exponential. That's the property you're
trying to exploit here.</p>

<p>So now, we've got <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> to be this one. And <i>z</i>
itself, the complex function I'm looking for is <i>F<sub>0</sub></i>
over <i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, divided by this quantity
downstairs. This quantity downstairs I'm going to call I<i>(ω)</i>.
<i>I(ω)</i> is a complex number. It's got a real part and an imaginary
part. The real part is <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> -
ω<sup>2</sup></i>. The imaginary part is <i>ωγ</i>. It's not a fixed
complex number, but every frequency of the driving force <i>ω</i>, it
is a different complex number, but if it's sitting at one frequency of
the driving force, it's a particular number. Everyone should know how
to work it out. <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> is the root of <i>k</i> over
<i>m</i>; <i>ω</i> is given to you, that's the real number. <i>γ</i> is
given to you, that's an imaginary part. If you actually put in numbers,
it might look like six plus five <i>i</i>. In the end, the thing I
called impedance or <i>I</i>, is just a complex number. But it varies
from frequency to frequency. You can see that.</p>

<p>Okay, now we've got <i>z</i> of <i>t</i>. If the problem given to us
was <i>z</i> we're done. You don't have to do any more work. Here's the
answer. But we were told to take the real part of this answer because
<i>x</i> was the real part of the answer; <i>y</i> was not part of the
game. How do you take the real part? Your temptation may be well,
<i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i> is <i>cos ωt</i> plus <i>i sine ωt</i>, so
drop the <i>i sin ωt</i>. But that would not be right. Now, why is that
not right? Anyone know why that's not the way to get the real part yet?
Yep? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b> Yes. This number downstairs is
not a real number. It's a complex number. So, if you have a complex
number on the top, divided by the complex number in the bottom, the
real part is not simply the real part of the top. You got to write the
whole thing so you can clearly separate the real and imaginary parts,
and that's what I'm going to do next. Every complex number we know can
be returned as an absolute value times <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i>.
Right? Every <i>z</i> looks like [inaudible] <i>e</i> to the <i>iθ</i>,
because then it's [inaudible] <i>cos θ</i> which is <i>x</i>, plus
<i>i</i> times [inaudible] which is <i>iy</i>. So, every complex number
can be written that way and what will be the magnitude of this guy?
Well, by the Pythagoras' theorem, it'll be the square of the real part,
plus the square of the imaginary part under root. Every complex number
that you have will have an absolute value which is that square plus
that square under the root, and it'll have a phase <i>φ</i>, obeying
the condition <i>tan</i> <i>φ</i>, is the imaginary part divided by the
real part.</p>

<p>I want you to realize that in a given problem, with a given mass,
given friction, given frequency, both these are known. They're simply a
magnitude and the phase of <i>I</i> can by found by this process. Now,
write it like that, then you get <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>,
divided by the absolute value of <i>I</i>, e to the i<i>φ</i>, and I
got e to the <i>iωt</i> on the top. I'm almost there. I'm almost there
because <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i> in the bottom can be written as
<i>e</i> to the minus <i>iφ</i> on the top. So then, this whole thing
becomes F<sub>0</sub> over m divided by the absolute value of i,
<i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, minus <i>φ</i>. Now, it's easy to take the
real part because this is <i>cos ωt</i> minus <i>φ</i> plus <i>i + sin
ωt</i> minus <i>φ</i>. These are all real numbers. So, they'll just
multiply the whole thing. But the real to imaginary separation now
comes from just taking the cosine part of this exponential. And that is
our final answer. That's the answer we've been looking for, which is
x(t) is equal to <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, divided absolute
value of <i>I</i>, <i>cos ωt</i> - <i>φ</i>.</p>

<p>Why did we go through the whole business of complex numbers? We went
there because the answer is not a cosine and it's not a sine. <i>Cos ωt
-</i> <i>φ</i>, if you know your trigonometry, is <i>cos ωt</i>, <i>cos
φ - sin ωt sin</i> <i>φ</i>. So, <i>cos ωt</i> has got some <i>sin
ωt</i> and that's why it's hard to guess that answer. But if you go
through complex numbers, it comes out very easily.</p>

<p>So, the next thing is to analyze the properties of the answer you
got. You can write this whole thing in front as some overall amplitude
<i>x<sub>0</sub> cos ωt - φ</i> and you ask, "What does this function
look like?" Well, this function is obvious to all of you, it's
oscillating. Notice that even though it is oscillating like a cosine,
it's not in step with the applied force. The applied force is <i>cos
ωt</i>. Its maximum occurs at 0, 2<i>π</i>, 4<i>π</i>, et cetera. This
guy's maximum occurs somewhat later. The first maximum occurs when
<i>ωt</i> = <i>φ</i>. So, it's said to be lagging the function. You can
imagine two functions oscillating. One is behind the other one. It
reaches the maximum slightly later. So, the first property is in a
driven oscillator, the <i>x</i> will not be in step with the <i>F</i>.
It will be lagging. Or, it could be leading depends on what <i>φ</i>
is.</p>

<p>Then, what about the amplitude of oscillation? That's the thing
that's very interesting. How big is the oscillation? It looks like
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i> divided by the absolute value of
<i>I</i>. Let me write the absolute value of <i>I</i> for you. So, the
amplitude of oscillation depends on the frequency. You've got to draw
the graph. That's the function of frequency. What does the one over
this look like? Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, but (A minus B)<sup>2</sup>
= (B minus A)<sup>2</sup>; that's why I've not been paying attention.
Okay. Yeah, so I'm pretty careless on what I put in, but this is one
occasion where I sort of know it's okay. I'm going to square this, I
don't have to remember who is <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> and who's <i>ω</i>.
I have to be very careful where I don't square things like here. But if
I'm squaring it, it doesn't matter. Okay, so go back here and plot
something divided by this denominator and ask, "What is it at various
frequencies?" When <i>ω</i> is 0, that goes away, that goes away, you
get <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, and
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> is <i>k</i> over <i>m</i>, and I claim
what you will find initially is this will become <i>F<sub>0</sub></i>
over <i>k</i>. That'll be the value of this whole amplitude at 0
frequency. I hope that makes a lot of sense to you. Zero frequency
means the force of not even oscillating. It's a constant force. What
<i>x</i> are you going to get? You're going to get the force divided by
the force constant. That's the <i>x</i> to which you'll pull the
spring. That's why if you put all the <i>ω</i>s and masses back into
their proper place, you'll find there's <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over
<i>k</i>. Then what happens is as <i>ω</i> increases, this denominator,
one of these guys, a denominator is starting to vanish. If <i>γ</i>
were a very, very tiny number, when <i>ω<sub>0</sub> = ω</i>, you will
be dividing by a very small number and the answer will have a huge
rise. Then, you can see when <i>ω</i> goes to infinity, very large
<i>ω</i>, you're diving by <i>ω</i> square, it'll fall off like
this.</p>

<p>Now, one of the homework problems is to find out exactly where it
peaks. But if <i>γ</i> is very small, you don't have to do much work to
know it peaks at <i>ω = ω<sub>0</sub></i>, but otherwise it's near
that. That's the phenomenon that's called resonance. Resonance is the
following. You are applying a force, <i>F<sub>0</sub> cos ωt</i>. You
go on varying the frequency and in response to your force, the system
oscillates. The amplitude of oscillation is the largest when the
applied frequency is very near the natural frequency. If you take the
limit of a very small <i>γ</i>, this maximum is very close to
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. That's called resonance. If <i>γ</i> is really
tiny, you can get graphs where it's incredibly peaked. So, that's when
systems start vibrating a lot. That's why when your car goes over
certain bumps, they're periodic, they're hitting your car at a certain
frequency, and if that frequency is anywhere near the natural frequency
or vibration of your suspension system in the car, the car begins to
resonate. There's this famous bridge in Tacoma that was getting hit by
these winds, they were coming at some frequency and by bad luck, they
coincided with the natural frequency of the bridge. So, there is this
famous movie made for high school, in which the bridge oscillates more
and more and more and twists and turns and collapses. That's another
example of resonance. People always say, "Yeah I can resonate with what
the person is saying." What does that mean? A person is saying whatever
the hell he wants. Some people think it's interesting and some people
think it's boring. It's the same thing here. The force is acting at a
certain frequency. If your natural frequency is close to that, your
response is high. If it's low, you don't care. Same thing. That's
mechanical systems selecting a frequency.</p>

<p>In fact, this is how radios work. You have a radio, if there's only
one radio station, you build an electrical circuit in which the
currents like to go back and forth and oscillate at a certain
frequency, a radio station should send signals at that frequency, your
response will be very high. But what if there's more than one radio
station, which is a fact of life? What do they do? What they do is each
one sends a signal at a different frequency. You take your radio and
there are dials inside. Well, I forgot, do you kids--do you know what a
dial is? You're not just pushing some other button. There is a time
when you had to turn a dial. When you turn a dial, you're changing the
properties of the electrical circuit and changing its natural
frequency. You move the natural frequency until it lines up with the
frequency of the radio station, with one particular station. Then, the
response from that station is very high and that's the sound you hear.
Other stations are also present, but you're not near their maximum,
they are sitting, some right here and some right here. So, you want the
station frequency to come under this resonance peak. So, if you've got
a bad radio, it will pick up sound from many stations because it's not
very refined. If the peak is broad, you will get sound from many
stations. You want to build a system which is very finely sensitive to
the frequency. That requires <i>γ</i> to be very small. If <i>γ</i> is
very, very small, you can see if <i>γ</i> is going to 0, the
denominator is one divided by 0, it's going to be infinite. So, if
<i>γ</i> is very tiny, one over very tiny, is very big, and you can get
enormous spikes in this part and that's what people need.</p>

<p>Okay, the last thing you need to do this problem set. By the way, I
know this problem set is very nasty. Towards the end, it got tough, you
got email, I agree with you that this whole course is somewhat more
difficult than it has always been. Okay? I'm aware of that fact, and I
will bear this fact in mind when you go into your final because for
some reason I wanted to use problems not in our book but for technical
reasons so I got them from here or there or made them up. They
generally tend to be more challenging and more time consuming. So, if
you thought this was a tough course, well, it's supposed to be a tough
course but maybe not this hard or not this time consuming. So, I will
remember that in the end when I make the final exam or look at your
grade, I will have to compare you not simply to your predecessors, but
I will have to cut you some slack and then compare you to previous
generations.</p>

<p>So, this use of complex numbers is something from which I will not,
however, back down. It turns out that yes, you can do all of this
without using complex numbers. Why? Because in the real world,
everything has got real numbers. So, you can in fact, by an orgy of
trigonometric identities solve it with sines and cosines. But
eventually, I'll give you a problem where you just cannot do it in a
meaningful way. The power of complex numbers is they turn differential
equations into algebraic equations. All you have to do is find the
roots of a quadratic equation, whereas what you started out was to find
a solution of a differential equation. That advantage you will lose if
you stop using complex numbers, and when you do quantum mechanics in
the second term, the complex numbers are in the equations of motion.
The analog of <i>F = ma</i>, there's an <i>i</i> sitting there. So, you
cannot escape the <i>i</i>. It's there, so I'm saying, depending on how
much exposure you've had, you have to do more or less work, but you
just got to get used to complex numbers. You got to get used to the
absolute value, the phase angle, how to manipulate. If you already know
it, good. If you don't know it, you have to do more work than other
people but I'm not going to let off on it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. Anything you need to know
with differential equations is what I've done for you in the class
today. That's it. That's the only part you know, and with complex
numbers, you turned it into ordinary equations. So, you have to go over
these steps and work them out. That's the part I cannot do for you.
That's something you have to do.</p>

<p>Alright, what is finally missing is that <i>x</i> of <i>t</i>; if I
wrote for you what I wrote above, which is <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, I
don't want to write the <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> again. It's
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>mi</i>; maybe I'll write the whole thing.
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, divided by absolute value <i>i</i>
times cosine <i>ωt</i> minus <i>φ</i>. It turns out this is not the
full answer to the question of what happens when I push a mass. Let's
understand why. Suppose I go this mass and spring system. I grab at a
<i>t</i> = 0 and start shaking it. Well, at <i>t</i> = 0, <i>x</i> was
0 because I grabbed it at <i>t</i> = 0. But a <i>t</i> = 0, if I go to
this solution, it's not giving me 0. It's saying it's
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>mi cos</i> <i>φ</i>. So, what happened to
the freedom I had to assign the velocity and position arbitrarily?
Well, it turns out that I can still do that. That's because this
solution has got a part that's actually missing, and the part that's
missing is this complimentary solution, <i>Ae</i> to the minus
<i>γt</i> over two, cosine of <i>ω</i> prime <i>t</i> minus
<i>φ</i><sub>0</sub>. You can always add the solution to this solution.
Why is that? Because if <i>x</i> obeyed a certain equation, if I put
that in, I'm saying adding this part will not change the fact that it
obeys the equation. Let's ask ourselves why. Go back to the top line
there. <i>x</i> double dot + <i>γx</i> dot +
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x</i>, will be equal to
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m cos ωt</i>, if you put this in.</p>

<p>Now, what if you keep adding this to the solution? Will you mess it
up? Imagine adding this to the left-hand side, but I claim on the
left-hand side there'll be no extra terms because this guy double dot
plus <i>γ</i>, times this guy dot, plus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> times this guy is 0. This is the
function which you will say is annihilated by the operations on the
left-hand side. It's like saying the following. If you want a function
whose derivative is equal to <i>sin x</i>, then I'm going to say oh, I
know the function is minus <i>cos x</i>, and you all know you can add
to that a constant. Why do you add the constant? Why doesn't it screw
up everything? Because a derivative of a constant is 0. Well, here this
is not a constant and yet, the combination of derivatives appear in the
equation act on this to give you 0. That's why you can add it without
screwing up what you've done so far. So, the way you do these problems
is you first find this function that depends on the applied force, and
you add to this solution you get for free, even in the absence of an
applied force. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What does the <i>x<sub>C</sub></i> stand for
again?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's called a complimentary
function and this is called a particular solution. This particular
solution depends on the force and this is the function. I don't know
why it's called complimentary. Maybe it compliments the answer, or it's
a freebie, you don't pay for it with any force, but it's called
complimentary. But you've got to add the two to get the final
answer.</p>

<p>So, you will still have the numbers <i>A</i> and <i>φ</i>
<sub>0</sub> hanging around, and how do you select them? You select
them if on top of it, somebody tells you that this driven oscillator
had a certain coordinate and certain velocity at <i>t</i> = 0. So, you
evaluate the whole expression of <i>t</i> = 0 by putting <i>t</i> = 0
everywhere, you'll get one equation involving <i>A</i> and <i>φ</i>
<sub>0</sub> and you'll take the derivative for the velocity, set that
equal to some given number. You get a second equation involving
<i>A</i> and <i>φ</i> <sub>0</sub>. You'll juggle the two equations and
solve for the two numbers, <i>A</i> and <i>φ</i> <sub>0</sub>. Okay, so
that is the whole story, okay? That's what I tried to do yesterday, but
this is not the first time it's happened to me that I tried to go fast;
in the end I lost time because I was not happy with the way it was
explained, and I usually come back and say sorry and then do it all
over again, okay? But there's only so much I can do. The rest is up to
you guys. You have to do the work and you have to do more problems.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, we are moving off to another topic. The other
topic--Somebody was sighing with relief. It's not really different.
Okay, these are waves. But I think it's going to be--I think this
probably is the hardest point of what we're doing in this term, at
least mathematically. Everything else we do, heat, hot water, cold
water, that kind of stuff you've done in high school, that's all in
your future, it's going to be a lot easier.</p>

<p>Okay. Waves. So, everyone has a good feeling for waves. You go to a
lake; you know if you're a hit man for the mafia, you're dropping
things in with some weight. They go down, what's the first thing they
do? When bodies are falling into the water, it's carving out some body
of water and diving in so the water next to it dives in to fill that
hole. But then the water, even next to it, tries to fill in the hole
left behind by these guys. For you, it looks like a bunch of ripples
traveling outwards from the center. So, this is the classic example of
a wave. If you've got one example, you can latch onto it every time I
say wave.</p>

<p>So, what's the wave in this problem is that if I draw a plot of the
height of the water, versus the place where it dropped, the rock--maybe
I should do a top view here. This is the top view, after a while you've
got these ripples emanating from this point. Or, if you kept your eye
next to the water you will find these ups and downs going outwards. So,
the wave is some displacement of a medium. That's what people say.
That's not a perfect definition because we know electromagnetic waves
have no medium. They travel in a vacuum. But I think for this purpose
in this course, you should imagine waves as what happens when you
excite a medium.</p>

<p>So, here's the way to think about the wave. You all understand the
harmonic oscillator pretty well, right? Mass and spring system in
equilibrium will sit there forever. If you give it a kick, it'll start
vibrating around its equilibrium position. There, you have to keep
track of only one variable <i>x</i>, which is the location of the mass.
The wave is an oscillation of a medium that means that every point in
space there is something that's ready to oscillate. So, you start out a
system with infinite number of degrees of freedom because the height of
the water at each point is an independent variable. It can jump up and
down with time. And that's what is oscillating. So, if you don't do
anything to the water, it'll stay at the height, but if you fiddle with
it or drop something, you hit it with something, it'll start vibrating.
But except it's a vibration not out of one variable but of a variable
in space and time. <i>x</i> was a function of time and the name we use
for the wave, if something is oscillating such as the water measured
from some point, <i>x</i>. I'm going to use the symbol <i>ψ</i> of
<i>x</i> [and t] to denote the height of the water from its normal
position at the point <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i>. So, <i>x</i> is not a
dynamical variable here. <i>x</i> labels the point. <i>Ψ</i> is the
dynamical variable. <i>Ψ</i> is the thing jumping up and down.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, there are two kinds of waves; there's the longitudinal
wave and the transverse wave. And we define them as follows. The wave
travels out with some velocity. I'm going to use the symbol <i>v</i>
for the velocity of the wave. That's something for which all of you
would have intuitive understanding so no need to mess it up right now.
You go to the lake, you drop a rock, you see when the waves get to the
shore, you take the distance divided by time, that's the velocity. In
sound, you know, you light up a firecracker, after a while, you hear
it, you can see how long it took and how far you are and you can find
the velocity. That's the velocity of sound in air. And all these
velocities are all variable. Unlike the velocity of light that doesn't
seem to depend on anything.</p>

<p>All other velocities depend on various conditions. The velocity of
sound depends on the temperature, for example. Or you can take the
following thing, you can take an iron rod, which you know is made up of
a lot of atoms and you take a hammer and you hit it here. You basically
compress these atoms and they compress the atoms next to them and the
shockwaves travels through this rod; that's also called sound. That
travels at a speed which is much faster than the speed of sound and
air. But it's technically also called sound. If you were a creature
living inside the iron bar, you would think of it as sound.</p>

<p>Now, here's another way you can hear it. For example, here's a
standard example. Here's the railway track, and there is some kind of a
mountain here, and you are over here and the train is coming here. It
turns out, if the train lets out a sound, the sound will travel around
the bend and you will hear it. But actually, the pounding of the train
on the tracks will set up shockwaves in the track that you can hear by
putting your ear to the track. And you will hear the train before you
hear it by, depending on the sound coming through the air, because the
waves going through the solids travel much faster. Okay, so I would
recommend that if you're going to do this, you do this somewhere here
because you won't have enough time to move if you do it here
[laughter]. So, most of the things--please don't do this at home, this
should be done by a trained person but I certainly did it as a kid,
listened for trains before they come around the bend and you can
actually hear the track. Or in water, the explosions in water, you can
hear them faster if you're under the water than if you're outside the
water because the waves travel faster in water than in air. Thunder and
lightning is the most famous example. Something happens in the sky, the
lights get to you first, and the sound gets to you; they're traveling
at different velocities.</p>

<p>Okay. So now, let's talk about longitudinal transverse waves. When I
talk to you, I think you sort of know what happens. The air in this
room is at some pressure, and that pressure is constant, and the
pressure is pushing your eardrum from the outside and going through
your Eustachian canal pushing the drum from the inside, and the two
pressures balance and you don't feel anything. If I talk, the vocal
chords move back and forth and they increase and decrease the pressure
as I talk. If I push out, I increase the pressure, if I go backwards, I
decompress the air and reduce the pressure. Those shockwaves propagate
to your ear. They hit your eardrum, but the eardrum is getting the
pressure difference from the outside, but the inside pressure is fixed.
So, what happens is when I decompress, the eardrum comes out and goes
in. It goes back and forth and the eardrum moves. Then, behind the
eardrum are the little bones, and then the bones go and there is a tube
and the doctors take over from this point.</p>

<p>So, some loose hair is shaking in this fluid; then, it picks up some
nervous things and goes to your brain. Then, you figure out and
actually know what the person's saying. You don't know why he's talking
in this particular fashion, but you can at least understand and
translate. That's a long chain of transducers of energy from sound to
the stuff in your ear into your brain. I draw the line at the eardrum.
I don't want to go on the other side of the eardrum because it's very
shaky turf. But this part I know very well. It's a sound wave and it's
a longitudinal wave for the following reason. If you look at the
pressure waves, the molecules of air--they're going back and forth,
follow my hands, and the signal from me to you is also going from me to
you, so the motion is in line with the velocity. The motion of the
medium is in the same direction as the motion of the wave. A transverse
wave is what you find in water if you are--or on a string.</p>

<p>Take a string, clamp down that end and you give it a little flick
like that. This bump after a while will end up here. So, the rope is
moving, transfers but the velocity if the signal is to the right. So,
do not confuse the motion of the medium with the motion of the signal,
okay? The rope, at any given point, is either at rest or going up and
down, but the signal is going from left to right. So, the medium
doesn't have to actually move in the direction of the wave. For
example, if a bunch of people line up and each one tells the person
next to the next person some secret and the secret is eventually
transmitted all the way to the end, what has traveled is a secret. The
actual person in the first place has not gone over physically to the
end. So, what happens is as you're sitting there not doing anything and
suddenly you hear something, you pass it on to the next person, then
you've gone back to doing nothing. Then, the signal travels. That's
what will happen in the rope here. This section of the rope is not
doing anything. When this pulse hits it, it'll jump up and down for a
while. Then it'll quiet down and somebody to the right will start
moving. Okay, so there are the examples of longitudinal and transverse
waves.</p>

<p>So, we have the notion of velocity. Now, I want to consider one
concrete example of a wave, so you people have a good feeling of how to
study waves in physics. So, there are many, many waves. Water waves,
electromagnetic waves, elastic waves. I'm going to do one. I think to
do one thing in some depth will give you a feeling for how we analyze
waves. That's going to be waves on a string. So, you have to imagine
that I have a string that's been clamped at two ends, and somebody
plucks the string, say, into that shape and lets it go, we know the
string is going to vibrate back and forth. Now, let's measure the
coordinate <i>x</i>, which is the point on the string, and <i>ψ</i> is
the displacement of the string at that point. You guys got that this is
really the <i>x</i>, this is not my string. That is my string. Each
point is labeled by an <i>x</i> value that it will have for the string
to relax to the normal position. So, we are asking what is the
displacement of the string at the point <i>x</i>, at time, <i>t</i>.
So, <i>ψ</i> is our new dynamical variable, namely, the variable for
which we like to write the equations governing its motion. And we want
to ask how does <i>ψ</i> vary with time? What will it do? If I start it
out, what will it do? Do you understand the parallel to the mass and
spring system? The mass and spring system, you got a mass and you got a
spring, you pull the mass out to some new location, you let it go and
you want to know what it does. The answer was <i>cos ωt</i>. Now, at
every point <i>x</i>, I have some string, and I displace all those
degrees of freedom and I let them go, and they're going to do something
and I want to know how they're all varying. So previously, we had only
one coordinate which I called <i>x</i>, which varied with time. Now
with every point, <i>x</i>, I have a coordinate <i>ψ</i> that varies
with time. And our job is to find the equation satisfied by
<i>ψ</i>.</p>

<p>So, let us take a string and the string has to be under some
tension. That means you hang some weights on the end or you tighten it
with some screws. There's a tension so that the string is dying to
break apart if you cut it. So, <i>T</i> is the tension on the string.
Without the tension none of this would work. So, here is the string.
And I'm going to analyze the fate of a tiny segment of length
<i>dx</i>. An essential parameter here is called--which is <i>μ</i>,
the mass per unit length. That means you put the string on a weighing
machine, you find the mass and you divide by the length. For example,
if you've got a ten meter string and it weighs one-tenth of a kilogram,
then the mass per unit length is one over thousand [correction: should
have said "hundred"] kilograms per meter. And <i>T</i> is the tension.
The textbook may use <i>F</i> for tension because <i>T</i> is the time
period also, so it depends on what symbol they use in the book. I'm not
completely sure. I'm going to call it <i>T</i> because it's been called
<i>T</i> in the past. Now, I pull this thing and I want to know what
the whole string will do. Who is going to tell me now? I mean, what
authority will decide the behavior of this string? What do we have to
appeal to? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Very good. So, he said, find the
force that will return it to the original position and what was the
<i>it</i> that you mentioned?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me? Right, but we are
going to apply--yes, any other answers before I go? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Can't you model the motion of the string by saying
that [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, it will look like that.
That is correct. But all I want you to understand is, there are no new
laws that I'm going to invoke. I'm not going to say, well, we studied
masses and springs, today it's time to study strings and I'm going to
tell you a new law of motion. There's only one law of motion. That's
<i>F = ma</i>. The whole purpose of my exercise now is to show you that
really does control, that's why it's a super law. Everything mechanical
follows from that law and I want to show you <i>F = ma</i> is all I
have and I've got to use it properly and that's going to tell me what
the strings will do.</p>

<p>So, what I do is--The string is, of course, a long and extended and
complicated object. I isolate a portion of it, of length <i>dx</i>, and
I'm going to apply <i>F = ma</i> to that guy. All I need to know if the
<i>F</i>, the total force on it, and I'm going to equate it to mass
times acceleration. Okay now, this force on the little segment is the
tension pulling this way, the same tension pulling that way. The
tension on the string doesn't change from point to point. But the angle
at which it is pulling is not necessarily the same. Here, there is some
angle <i>θ</i> + <i>Δθ</i>, and here, there is an angle <i>θ</i>. This
force is at an angle, say, <i>θ</i> below the horizontal, this is
pulling about <i>θ + Δθ</i>. So, the string is curving; therefore, the
tangent to the string at this end and that end are not quite the same
and that's the key. Because if they were exactly the same, the same
tension on the two ends, if you take any object like this and apply
exactly the same force, they will cancel because they're opposite
forces, and <i>F</i> is 0, <i>ma</i> will be 0, and this thing won't
move. The reason it moves is because even though the magnitude of the
force is the same, the angle at which it's acting is not the same.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to find out the vertical component of the force here
and take the difference from there [pointing at picture]. So, the force
here will be <i>T</i> times <i>sin + Δθ</i>. <i>θ</i> is the angle with
the horizontal. And the force on the other side will be <i>T</i> times
<i>sin θ</i>. <i>θ</i> is the angle made by the string from the
horizontal, and that angle is simply changing over this tiny length.
Next approximation--that's the force. That's going to be mass times
acceleration. Mass of this little segment is the mass per unit length,
times the length of the segment. Now, what is the acceleration in the
language of calculus? What is the acceleration here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah, he said
<i>d<sup>2</sup>x</i> over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>, but the <i>d</i> by
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> is right. It's not <i>d<sup>2</sup></i> of
<i>x</i> of <i>ψ</i> because you've got to understand--I think--Look,
this was not a fair trick, but you have to be aware that what is
oscillating up and down is the coordinate side. <i>x</i> is not a real
dynamical coordinate. <i>x</i> is a label on the string. What's jumping
up and down is <i>ψ</i>, so the acceleration is the second derivative,
and I write partial derivative because <i>ψ</i> can vary with <i>x</i>,
or it can vary with time and I want to take the second time derivative.
Now, come to the left-hand side and you assume the angles involved are
very small. If the angles involved are very small, I remind you guys of
the falling identity, <i>sin θ</i> begins as <i>θ</i> plus dot, dot,
dot. You remember the series I wrote for you. <i>Cos θ</i> is one minus
<i>θ<sup>2</sup></i> over two, and we have decided that we are going to
treat <i>θ</i> so small that <i>θ<sup>2</sup></i>, we're not interested
in. And <i>tan θ</i>, which is <i>sin θ</i> over <i>cos θ</i>, is now
<i>θ</i> over one, which is <i>θ</i>. So, small angle approximation is
<i>sin θ</i>, approximately equal to <i>θ</i>, <i>cos θ</i>
approximately equal to one, <i>tan θ</i> may be approximately replaced
by <i>θ</i>.</p>

<p>So, first nice break. We don't have to work with sine, we just want
<i>T</i> of <i>θ + Δθ</i> minus that, which is <i>T</i> of <i>θ</i>.
<i>Δθ</i> is a change in the angle from the left hand of the string bit
to the right end of the string bit. Now, I got a <i>dx</i> here, so
what I'm going to do is divide by a <i>dx</i> and multiply by a
<i>dx</i>. We are almost there in deriving the equation. Look, I've
been calling it <i>dx</i> and <i>Δx</i> so pardon that. Just call it
<i>dx</i>. <i>μ</i>, <i>dx</i>, <i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>. Now, what is <i>θ</i>? I'm going to say <i>θ</i>
is the same as <i>tan θ</i> in the small angle approximation. <i>tan
θ</i> is <i>dψ/dx</i>. You know from the calculus, if you move
horizontally by <i>dx</i> and you move vertically by <i>dψ</i>,
<i>dψdx</i> is a tan of the angle. That's one of the first things you
learned in calculus. So, this is really <i>d</i> by <i>dx</i> of
<i>dψdx</i>, that becomes <i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over
<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>, equal to <i>μd<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Now, some of you may find the derivation hard. Then forget about the
details. You're not responsible for that. But some of you may say look,
I don't ever want you to tell me something which you cannot prove
unless it's an axiom or a law of nature. Well, this is not a new law of
nature, so I have to tell you where I got this. I got this by applying
<i>F = ma</i> to a tiny portion of the string. And you can ask
yourself, when you pull a string up, why does it come down? It comes
down because there's a tension on the string and the tension here and
the tension here have vertical components that don't quite match. You
see the string is flattening out like this; the vertical downward
component of this is bigger than the vertical upward component of this
force. If it is resolved into the vertical or horizontal part the
downward part is bigger than the upward part in this picture.
Therefore, there's a net force bringing you down. That one is bringing
you down is because the derivative here and here are not the same,
because the derivative is the slope. So, the whole thing depends on the
rate of change of the rate of change, and that's why you get this. But
the mass of the tiny segment also depends on <i>dx</i>, so <i>dx</i>
cancels in the end. You drop it and you get this equation. So, what I
want you to think of is <i>dθ/dx</i> is really d by dx of dψ/dx. Well,
I should actually use partial derivatives, because <i>ψ</i> depends on
<i>x</i> and <i>t</i>, so if you're real careful with that, you get
<i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>So now, I'm going to write down the final wave equation. From this
point on, you have to get engaged in the problem because even though
you may or may not follow the derivation, you should know what is
called a wave equation. This is the wave equation:
<i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over <i>dx<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to 1 over
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ</i> over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>,
where <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to <i>t</i> over <i>μ</i>, or
<i>v</i> is square root of <i>T</i> over <i>µ</i>. I just invented a
symbol <i>v</i>. This is very important. What you have to know is that
<i>ψ</i>, the displacement of the string at the point labeled <i>x</i>
horizontally from the left-hand, at the time <i>t</i>, varies with time
according to this equation.</p>

<p>This is a very famous equation and it turns out you take any elastic
medium and you disturb it a little bit from equilibrium, always seems
to obey equations of this type. So, our job from now until some time is
to analyze the equation and see what it means. What are the
consequences of this wave equation? And even though I called it
<i>v</i>, as units of velocity, I have no right to argue that it really
is the velocity of the wave. We'll have to find out. It's got
dimensions of velocity; you can check by putting the units in.</p>

<p>Okay but now, let me write down a solution to this equation; then,
we'll understand what can happen. So, this is like saying I've got some
equation, second derivative of <i>x</i> is equal to some number times
<i>x</i>, and we said the answer is <i>cos ωt</i> and <i>sin ωt</i>.
But now, we've got second derivatives with the respect to space, second
derivatives with respect to time and I know that this guy is going to
oscillate up and down. But it's going to oscillate, if you imagine a
string, take a string or a water wave that is traveling back and forth;
the ripples are traveling. If you took a snapshot of the wave at a
given time, it would be going up and down in space. Or if you stood at
one point in the water and have the wave go past you, the water will go
up and down in time at a given space. You understand?</p>

<p>If the wave is coming towards the shore, you stand in one place, you
don't have to move. The wave will go past you and where you are, the
water will go up and down with time. Or, if you took a picture of it at
one instant, the wave will go up and down in space at a given time. So,
waves oscillate in space and time and you have to guess the answer.
Now, if I had more time, I can tell you guys how to deduce the answer.
It's not very hard, but I just don't have that kind of time. So, I'm
going to just write down a solution. In fact, there are many, many
solutions to the equation. It's very general, so I'm going to write a
particular solution. The solution I'm going to write down looks like
this. It is some number <i>A</i>, which is the amplitude and it looks
like cosine, some number called <i>k</i> times <i>x</i> minus
<i>ωt</i>. Unfortunately, this <i>k</i> is not a force constant. It is
a new symbol. And <i>ω</i> is another symbol whose meaning we will
deduce shortly.</p>

<p>At least you can see that I just cannot write a wave like <i>x -
t</i> or something, because cosine should have an argument which has no
dimensions. So, if I have an <i>x</i>, I should multiply it by some
number that's got units of inverse <i>x</i>. And if I have a time, I
should multiply it by something that looks like a frequency. From
dimensional analysis, I look for a solution of this form to these
equations. Once again, whether you solve it--By the way, this called a
partial differential equation because it involves partial derivatives.
All I'm going to do--I'm going to be content with showing you that this
solution, when I stick it into this equation actually works. Let us
first verify that it works. Then, we'll come next Monday and analyze in
detail what does this really do? We'll come to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Let's verify that it works. So, let's take <i>dψ/dx</i>. What
happens when you take <i>dψ/dx</i>, when you take a partial derivative
with respect to <i>x</i> it says forget about time; treat <i>x</i> as
the only variable, then you'll get <i>-a sin kx - ωt</i>, times the
derivative of what's inside the argument which happens to be <i>k</i>.
Now, if you differentiate the second time,
<i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ/dx<sup>2</sup></i>, you do the whole thing again;
then, you'll get <i>-Ak<sup>2</sup> sin kx - ωt</i>.</p>

<p><b>Students:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I'm sorry--;yes--thank you
[correction: professor changes <i>Ak<sup>2</sup> sin kx - ωt</i> to
<i>Ak<sup>2</sup> cos kx - ωt</i>]. Now, if you take
<i>d<sup>2</sup>ψ/dt<sup>2</sup></i>, you will get <i>-ω<sup>2</sup> A
cos kx - ωt</i>. If you take one over <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> times that,
you'll get this. What does the wave equation say? It says, the second
derivative of an <i>x</i> should be one over <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> times
the second derivative in time. And for my solution, that's a second
derivative in <i>x</i>; that's a second derivative in time; I want them
to match. Well, they're almost there. <i>A</i> matches <i>A</i>, cosine
matches the cosine, but <i>ω</i> and <i>k</i> are not independent
numbers. <i>ω</i> over <i>v</i> should be equal to <i>k</i>. In other
words, this wave equation for waves on a string will have solutions
that look like this, where <i>A</i> can be any number you like,
<i>k</i> and <i>ω</i>, between the two of them, there is one degree of
freedom. You can pick <i>k</i> at will, and pick <i>ω</i> so that
<i>ω</i> will equal the <i>kv</i>, or pick <i>ω</i> freely, and choose
<i>k</i> so that <i>k</i> is <i>ω</i> over <i>v</i>. But there is a
relation between the two of them, which you can write in any number of
ways.</p>

<p>So, let us put that knowledge back into the solution. Let us say
<i>ω</i> is in fact <i>kv</i>, so that we write it explicitly in terms
of the <i>k</i>, which is completely free. So, <i>ψ</i> now looks like
<i>A cos</i>, <i>k</i> times <i>x</i> minus--;now, here is where you
guys got to do a little mental algebra here. If I pulled the <i>k</i>
out, can you see that <i>t</i> will be multiplied by <i>ω</i> over
<i>k</i>? But <i>ω</i> over <i>k</i> is <i>v</i>. So, this is my
solution. <i>A cos [k(x – vt)]</i>. And that is a very pretty result
and I just--I will conclude by telling you what that is telling
you.</p>

<p>It says that <i>ψ</i> of <i>xt</i>, which depends on <i>x</i> and
depends on <i>t</i>, depends on <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> through this
combination <i>x - vt</i>. In other words, if <i>x - vt</i> has a
certain value, <i>ψ</i> has a certain value. If I change <i>x</i> and
if I change <i>t</i>, keeping <i>x - vt</i> constant, the function
doesn't change, right, because it's a function only of this
combination. I will argue that that really means it's a wave that's
traveling at a velocity v. Let me show you why. Let's take a function,
<i>e</i> to the <i>-x<sup>2</sup></i>. You must have seen this function
in statistics. It looks like this. It likes to have <i>x</i> = 0. Take
the function that <i>x</i> is replaced by <i>x - vt</i>. Where does
this function have its maximum? It has a maximum when this guy on top
vanishes, that is to say, when <i>x = vt</i>. So, if you took the
function, <i>e</i> to the <i>(x - vt)<sup>2</sup></i> with the minus
sign, at <i>t</i> = 0 it'll be here, but other time it'll be here, but
at every instant, the bump will be moving to the right, you can see
with the velocity <i>v</i>, because the peak is at a location
<i>vt</i>. So, in a wave, the whole profile moves at a velocity and
that, for this symbol we use here is in fact the velocity of the
wave.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll give you one extreme example. At <i>t</i> = 0, it just
looks like <i>cos kx</i>, and we all know what <i>cos kx</i> looks
like. It's got a maximum of <i>x</i> = 0. If you wait a little longer,
where is this maximum a little later? If you increase <i>x</i> a little
bit, if you increase time a little bit, you got to increase <i>x</i> a
little bit so that these two still cancel each other. Originally,
<i>x</i> was at 0, and <i>t</i> was at 0; you were at a maximum. A
little later, after some time Δt, if you go to the point <i>Δx</i>, so
that these two numbers cancel, we are still riding the maximum. But
that means that <i>Δx</i> over <i>Δt</i> is <i>v</i>. That means, if
you move to the right, after <i>ψ</i> <i>Δt</i>, you will ride the
crest. That means the crest is moving at the velocity <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>So, I think to summarize what I've shown you so far, is that when
you take a string and you have a tension on it, you pull it and let it
go, it vibrates according to this equation; that is the first
statement. This is <i>a</i> solution. I'm not telling you it's the most
general one or the only one or anything. I want us to at least have one
concrete solution. And I've not told you yet how to visualize the
function, but I have told you whatever the function is, it is drifting
to the right at a speed that we call <i>v</i>. Because any function of
<i>x - vt</i> has a property that if [initially] it did something
<i>x</i> = 0, it does the same thing at <i>x = vt</i>. That means the
whole shape is bodily transported to the right. So, this really
signifies a wave traveling to the right. If you wanted a wave traveling
to the left, you should put a plus here; it'll go backwards.</p>
