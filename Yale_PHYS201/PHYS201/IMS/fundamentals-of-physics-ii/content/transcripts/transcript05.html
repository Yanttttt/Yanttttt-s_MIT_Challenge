<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> All right, guys, let's start today with a new idea. But before proceeding, I
should tell you where we stand. We can do the following problem. You give me
any number of charges which are fixed, anywhere you want. So here they are.
Here's one guy <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, here's <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>, here's <i>q<sub>3</sub></i>.
And instead of these discrete charges, you may have a line charge too, maybe &#955; coulombs
per meter. That guy is here. They are fixed. They are not dynamical. The
object of interest to us is this charge <i>q</i>, which can actually move,
allowed to move. </p>
<p>The question we ask
is, do we know what this charge will do? And the answer is, yes, we know what
it will do, because if it's sitting here and we have already computed the
electric field everywhere--you know how to compute electric field. Add the
field due to this one, that one, that one, add that. That is some electric
field sitting here. Then we know, the force on this charge we're interested
in, this <i>q</i> times the electric field at the location of the charge. So
at every instant, we know what force is acting on it. Then from Newton's law,
that will give me the rate of change of velocity or the acceleration. You can
write it either way. That's all I need, because using that I can find out the
new position, new velocity, right? The acceleration tells you, if you wait 1
nanosecond, you go to this place, because the initial velocity, I can predict
where it will be, and because you know the acceleration, I know what velocity
it will have. Then I keep on updating it and I get my trajectory.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I think it should
be <i>dt</i> squared.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, thank you. So everyone understands this is how you proceed. This charge
will of course push those guys, but we're not worried, because we don't let
them move. They are just fixed. And if there are much such charges, we can
find what they all do in this environment, which is the background electric
field. That's all we can do right now, this is electrostatics. In the real
world, everybody is moving and all kinds of stuff happens, but you cannot use
electrostatics for that. This asymmetry between the background and the test
charge that we are studying is in the static situation. Guys that move and
guys that don't. </p>
<p>Now this is something
you could have done on the first day, because I think on the very first day I
told you about Coulomb's law and the principle of superposition. If you put
them together, you know the force on a charge <i>q</i>. Then you use <i>F = ma</i>,
you predict its trajectory. But in principle, that's all you need to do
electrostatic problems, but in practice you want to clean up the machinery a
little bit, make it more efficient. For example, we found Gauss's law.
Gauss's law follows from Coulomb's law, but we found it's quite useful. For
example, if we give you a ball of charge, spherical charge, going back to
Coulomb's law and first principles is very difficult. But if you use Gauss's
law and the symmetries, you're able to find the electric field around the
sphere, or an infinitely long cylinder, or an infinite plane or simple
geometries like that. So it's not enough to say &quot;I've got the basic equations.&quot;
You always want to see if there are ways to speed up the computation to make
it more efficient. So let me remind you what we did in the first part of the
course. </p>
<p>There, if you have
the following question: here's a spring and here's a mass, the spring likes to
have that length and I pulled it to way over there and I released it, and right
now it happens to be here, going at some speed. I want to know what velocity
it will have when it is here, so this position is <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, this
speed is <i>v<sub>1</sub></i>, this position is <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. I want
to know <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>. That's a reasonable thing you can ask. Unlike
the electric force, the force on this mass is due to the spring. Apart from
that, it's the same situation. So one way to do that is to say, I know <i>F =
ma</i>, so the instant you start the problem here, I know the acceleration
because the force of the spring is -<i>k</i> times x<sub>1</sub>. Once I know
the force, I know the acceleration. I can find the new velocity, new position,
keep on doing it, or I can solve the equation, <i>d<sup>2</sup>x</i>/<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>
is &#8722;<i>kx</i>/<i>m</i>, and I can eventually end up here. Then I can find the
velocity here. But we all know that in this problem, there's a shortcut,
right? Yes? Anybody in the last row want to tell me what the shortcut is?
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You can use
conservation of energy.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Conservation of energy. So conservation of energy is a consequence of Newton's
laws and certain properties of the force. I'm going to remind you how it's
done. One attitude I could take is, you've already done this before, but
usually it's better to make sure that you're all on the same page when we do
this. So let me remind you how it works there. You go to Newton's laws and we
write <i>m dv</i>/<i>dt</i> = <i>F</i>. It's all in one dimension though. I'm
moving just along the line. Then I multiply both sides by <i>v</i>. On the
left hand side, if you know basic calculus, this is really <i>d</i>/<i>dt</i>
of <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>/2, by the chain rule of calculus. The <i>d/dt </i>derivative
is the <i>v</i> derivative, followed by the derivative of <i>v</i> with respect
to <i>t</i>. <i>v</i> derivative will give you <i>mv</i> and then there is
that. This becomes <i>F dx</i>/<i>dt</i>. </p>
<p>This means in every
tiny instant of time, the force times the change in the position is equal to
the change in this quantity, which we know is called kinetic energy. So if you
multiply both sides by <i>dt</i>, then you find this relation, and if you add
up all the changes, we get this relation, <i>m</i>--so let's see what we are
integrating from a starting point to an ending point and some starting time,
ending time. We get <i>mv<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>/2 - <i>mv<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>/2
= integral <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)<i>dx</i> from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>.
And this is called the work energy theorem. The work energy theorem tells you
something you may expect, namely, when a force acts on a body, it's going to
accelerate it. It's going to accelerate it, it's going to change the
velocity. You're going to ask, &quot;How much velocity change do I get for a
certain action of the force?&quot; and the statement is, the force pushes the
body from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, then this is the change
in this quantity called kinetic energy. This is true no matter what the force
is. It's true for friction, it's true for spring, it's true for everything,
because Newton's law is always valid. But if you want to extract from this a
law of conservation of energy, you have to do a certain manipulation and that's
what I'm going to describe. </p>
<p>So let's go back here
and try to extract from it a law of conservation of energy. So I'm going to
write here <i>k<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> is integral <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>)
<i>dx</i>, from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. Now it's a
fundamental result in calculus that integral of any function of <i>x</i> from
the point <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to the point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> can be written
as <i>G</i>(<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>) - <i>G</i>(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>), where <i>G</i>
is any function whose derivative is the <i>F</i> I'm integrating. For example,
if <i>F = x</i>, <i>G</i> = <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2, because derivative <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2
is <i>x</i>. In fact, it's not just <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2 . You can add <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>/2
+ a constant, but the constant is not important, because they'll cancel
between this and this. So you can pick the solution without a constant, okay?
</p>
<p>Now what does that
mean? Let's rearrange the expression so I get <i>K<sub>2</sub></i> &#8722; <i>G</i>(<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>)
= <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> &#8722; <i>G</i>(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>). That tells you the
combination <i>K</i> - <i>G</i> does not change as the particle moves, but this
doesn't look very nice. We want to get the old law of conservation of energy
in the standard form. You define the function <i>U</i>(<i>x</i>), you simply -
this <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>). It's a very trivial change. Then you can say <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>
+ <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>) = <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>),
and that is the energy that does not change with time. So the relation between
<i>U</i>, which is called the potential energy, and the force, is the
following. The force is - the derivative of the potential energy. </p>
<p>The - came because <i>G</i>
is the integral of <i>F</i>, but <i>U</i> is -<i>G</i>, so that this formula,
this means you have this relation. And you can also say <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>)
&#8722; <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>) with an integral of <i>F</i>(<i>x</i>) <i>dx</i>
from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, there's a - sign here.
Again, the - sign is present because <i>F</i> is defined to be - the derivative
of <i>U</i>. So you can go back and forth from potential to force and force to
potential. If you knew the force, you can integrate it to get the potential.
If you knew the potential, you can differentiate it to get the force, and more
importantly, you have this great conservation law, which is very helpful in the
spring problem, because if you know the potential energy, once and for all,
it's <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>/2, you balance the kinetic and the potential, you
can find the velocity at one other point. Now why doesn&#39;t this work for friction?
Friction is the one dimensional force. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's not
conservative.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It's not conservative. It's just a definition. But what's wrong with my
argument? Where in this argument does it fail? It looks like any
function--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because the
direction of the force depends on the direction that the particle's moving. </p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. The point is that frictional force is not a function just of your
location. It depends on your velocity. In other words, whereas the spring
will always exert a force -<i>kx</i>--if you are displaced to the right by an <i>x</i>,
it exerts a force -<i>kx</i>--whether or not you're moving to the right, away
from the equilibrium or towards it. Thus given <i>x</i>, it gives you a given
force, but friction is not like that. Friction does not have a definite
direction. The only thing friction wants to do is to slow you down. If you
want to go right, it wants to act left. If you want to go left, it wants to
act right. I will resist all political analogies. I'll just point out to you
that friction does not have a definite sign, therefore it's not a function of <i>x</i>,
but as she said, it's a function of <i>x</i> and of <i>x</i> dot, which is the
velocity. So it doesn't have a unique answer. </p>
<p>That does not mean
you cannot find the work due to friction. If you know it's moving to the
right, then the force is to the left. You can integrate that force, as long as
it is moving to the right. But if it's going right, left, right, left and
oscillating, then you cannot integrate it once and for all. That way doesn't
work for friction. Now here's an even more powerful example of the law of
conservation of energy. You have this famous roller coaster and you are here.
I say &quot;you are here,&quot; because you'll never get me on top of one of
these guys. So you are here and you got some speed, and I want to know your
speed when you are here. </p>
<p>Again, it follows
from Newton's laws. You can calculate from Newton's laws, because at every
point, wherever you may be, there's the force of gravity acting this way and
there is the perpendicular force from the track acting this way, and the
perpendicular force is such that it cancels this part of gravity, and this part
of gravity will accelerate it and you can find the velocity here. Keep doing
this, you can find the velocity at the end. But that's not how we do this. We
use the fact that the gravity force allows us to define an energy, and I'll
come to that in a moment. Then we say kinetic + potential is kinetic + potential
in the beginning and at the end, and we can simply find the velocity here if
you knew the potential energy here. </p>
<p>All right, so the law
of conservation of energy is also a very profound result, which has survived
all the revolutions of quantum mechanics. After quantum mechanics, we don't
like to think in terms of force, and we don't like to think in terms of
trajectories. You don't even know for sure where the particle is. But
amazingly, the total energy is always conserved in the problems we study. So
the law of conservation of energy is very profound and it's also very useful
for computations. Now the next question I have is, if I go to two
dimensions--and it's the same as in three dimensions. I'm just going to go to
two dimensions--what does it take to get the law of conservation of energy? So
I'm going to mimic this derivation in 2D and see if I can pull out a law of
conservation of energy. So here's what I will do. So in two dimensions, let
me start this time with the kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is &frac12;<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>,
but <b>v</b> has got 2 components, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, therefore it's &frac12;<i>mvx<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>vy<sup>2</sup></i>, but I'm going to write this &frac12;<i>m</i> <b>v</b>&#8901;<b>v</b>. Then let me ask,
what's the rate of change of this kinetic energy? </p>
<p>You've got to take
derivatives. Now you may be a little queasy about taking derivatives from this
dot product, but you can check by expanding the component, just like ordinary
product, and you can take derivative of this guy times that guy, + derivative
of that guy times this guy, and they will both be the same, and you will find
it's equal to <i>m dv</i>/<i>dt</i>, which is the force. I'm sorry. Let me
erase this. It's not <i>m dv</i>/<i>dt</i>; it is <i>mdv</i>/<i>dt</i>&#8901;<b>v</b>. So if you
integrate this, cancel the <i>dt</i> and add all the changes, you will find <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>
- <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>m</i> times <i>dr</i>--let me see--I'm sorry. I
want to keep the <i>dv</i>/<i>dt </i>here, then I want to write this <i>v</i>
as <i>dr</i>/<i>dt</i>. That's right. So let me do the following, excuse me. </p>
<p>Let me do it again. <i>dK</i>/<i>dt</i>
= <i>ma</i> times <i>v</i> and <i>v</i> is <i>dr</i>/<i>dt</i>. Now we cancel
the <i>dt</i>s and we write the change in <i>K</i> as <i>K<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>K<sub>1</sub></i>
= integral of <i>F</i>&#8901;<i>dr</i> from the starting
point <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> to the ending point <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. In other
words, the change in kinetic energy in one dimension is just force times
distance for tiny distances. In higher dimensions, like in 2 dimensions, if
the particle is moving in the 2 dimensional plane along some path and it moves
a distance <i>dr</i>, and at that point, the force is in that direction, you
should not simply take the product of the length of the force times the length
of the distance, but that times the cosine of the angle. </p>
<p>Why should it take
that? Because that's what gives you the rate of change of kinetic energy. Just
go to the kinetic energy and it suggests to you that you take this product and
define it to be the work, because if you define it that way, just like in 1D,
the work done by the force will be the change in kinetic energy. You guys with
me now? In spite of this little mess up here, this ma is my force. The <i>dt</i>s
got canceled. The <i>dK</i> is added up to <i>K<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>K<sub>1</sub></i>
and this is the integral. All right, so now it looks pretty good, except for
the complication. You have a dot product here. You have this nice result that
<i>K<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>K<sub>1</sub> </i>is the integral <i>F</i>&#8901;<i>dr </i>from<i> r<sub>1</sub>
</i>to <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. So let's imagine where <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>
are. This is say where you started, and maybe you ended up here at <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>.
You've just got to integrate this <i>F</i> from <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>.
Let's imagine there is no friction. Let's imagine <i>F </i>depends only on the
position. What's my problem now? What problem do we have? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> _______ going from
<i>r<sub>2</sub></i> to <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> _______.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, this integral gives me no choice. I must go from <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>.
Anybody know what's the problem? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Your path.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Your path. See, in 1 dimension, if I want to go from here to there, I have no
choice, okay? Just move along that line. In 2 dimensions, if you want to go
from one point to another, I can think of many ways. You can do that, you can
take the straight line path, or you can take some other path. That's an
ambiguity we have in higher dimensions. So even though the work energy theorem
is valid, and no matter which path you take, the work done by the force will be
the change in kinetic energy, this is not in general equal to some function at <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
- some function at <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. Because if it had this form, we are
done. You agree? If it had this form, then again you write<i> K<sub>2</sub> </i>+
<i>U<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>U<sub>1</sub></i>. But no
one's telling you that is true. If it was true, you are in business. But it's
a very unreasonable thing to ask of this force, that its integral from some
point to another point, does not depend on what path you integrate it on. In
other words, you can take that path, break it up into segments <i>dr</i>, and
on each segment, the force is some variable. You take <i>F&#8901;dr</i> of that little
segment, add it up over all the segments and make the segments vanishingly
small. That's the meaning of this integral. And you're supposed to get the
same answer, no matter what you do, including going like this, or anything
else. How can they all give the same answer? In fact, I'll give you a simple
example where it's simply not true, so the answer depends on the path. In fact,
just about any force you pick randomly will not have the property, the answer
does not depend on the path. Answers typically will depend on what path you
take. So let's take a simple force, <i>F</i> <i>=</i> <i>i</i><i>y</i>. I can
think of more complicated ones, but I don't have time to do them. </p>
<p>So here's a simple
one: force depends on position. It points in the <i>x</i> direction only and
it grows with <i>y</i>. And I'm going to do two calculations. I'm going to
find the integral from the origin to the point (1,1) first by going this way
and then by going that way. They are two possible paths. And you will see,
when I do the calculation, the answer is different. Therefore you cannot write
the answer as a difference of something here - something here, because the
answer is not a function only of the starting and ending points, but how you
got there. And I want to do this just to remind you how to do these
integrals. So let's take this segment here. What is the work done? The work
is the force which is <i>i</i> times <i>y</i> times the distance. If you move
horizontally, perhaps you guys can see <i>dr</i> for a tiny segment simply <i>i</i>
times <i>dx</i>. And <i>x</i> goes from 0 to 1. So how much is that? Can you
do this? I want the first person who knows the answer. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Zero
______________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. On this line, <i>y</i> is 0. In fact, if you draw a picture of the
force, it looks like this. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger as you go
further off. And if you go to negative values, it looks like this. So there
is no <i>y</i>, there is no force. That is 0. If you go to this segment, <i>y</i>
is definitely non-zero, but notice, the force is like this and the <i>dr</i> is
in the y direction and they are perpendicular, so the dot product is 0. Okay?
<i>dr</i> and <i>F</i> are perpendicular. One is along <i>i</i> and one is
along <i>j</i> dot product to 0. If you take this path, the work done is 0. </p>
<p>Now let's take the
other path, go like this and then like this. On this section, we have the same
problem. Force is to the right. You're moving straight up. <i>dr</i> and <i>F</i> are perpendicular. But on the last segment, from here to here, you get a non-zero
contribution, because force is <i>i</i><i>y</i>, displacement is <i>i</i><i>dx</i>
and <i>x</i> goes from 0 to 1, and <i>y </i>is frozen at the value 1, because
you're on this line. Frozen at the value 1. Just put 1 for it. And <i>i</i>&#8901;<i>i</i> is 1, integral of <i>dx</i>
is 1. Therefore the work done by the force going up and then to the right is
1. Going to the right and then up is 0. You can take other paths and keep
getting other answers. </p>
<p>So this is a force
for which it's not true, and I bet you that if you just randomly selected
forces in the 2 dimensional plane, they will never have the property that the
integral is path independent. So it looks like we are onto a hopeless task,
that the answer cannot depend on the path. So maybe there is no problem in
which you can derive a law of conservation of energy. Of course, you guys
know, you can derive a law of conservation of energy for a family of forces.
In fact, the answer is, there's an infinite of numbers of forces you can devise
for which this is true, namely, the answer does not depend on the path. Before
writing those forces, let me explain to you one other way to write the
condition. The condition, namely of a conservative force, is that the integral
from here to here is the same as the integral from there to there, from 1 to 2
along path <i>A</i> and 1 to 2 along path <i>B</i>. They must be equal for any
starting point and any ending point and any two paths joining them. </p>
<p>So what I'm saying is,
<i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2 along <i>A</i>
= integral <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2 along <i>B</i>.
Let me rewrite this by putting a - sign here and equate it to 0. That's fine.
Shifted it to the left hand side. But then we use the fact that when you go
from 1 to 2, with a - sign, this second guy is same as + from 2 to 1 along <i>B</i>
of <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>. In other words,
the line integral going this way is - the line integral going backwards,
because at every step, <i>dr</i> is opposite but <b>F </b>is the same at the
point, <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> changes sign.
Therefore it tells you then that the line integral from here to there and back
is 0. We write that by saying the line integral of <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> in a closed path is
0 for all paths, for all starting points, all ending points, all paths. And
that is the force that we want. That's the conservative force. I've just
rewritten. I've not gotten any closer to finding conservative force, but I'm
saying there are two ways to write it. Answer doesn't depend on the path, or
the answer on any closed loop, the line integral on any closed loop, is 0. That
means sometimes it's got to be positive, sometimes it's got to be negative. So
question is, where am I going to get a force with these amazing properties?
And I'm just going to give you the answer. </p>
<p>The theorem--if you
want, you can call it a theorem, you can call it whatever you like. It's a
fact--number 1, here is a recipe for finding conservative forces. Take any
function <i>U</i>(<i>x,y</i>). I'm just going to do it in 2 dimensions. In 3
dimensions, you can make it <i>U</i>(<i>x,y,z</i>). So let's give an example
here. <i>U</i> = <i>x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i>. Take that function. You
can write your own ticket. Write whatever function you want, time hyperbolic
sinh(<i>y</i>) times cosh(<i>x</i>), doesn't matter. Take a function. Then
the force that I want is the property that <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> = -<i>dU</i>/<i>dx</i>
and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>dU</i>/<i>dy</i>. </p>
<p>In other words, I'm
going to manufacture a force whose <i>x</i> component is - the <i>x</i>
derivative of the function I picked and the <i>y</i> component is - the <i>y</i>
derivative of the function I picked. So in my example, <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>
will be -<i>x</i> derivative partial means keep <i>y</i> as a constant, take
the derivative with respect to <i>x</i>. That's 3<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i> and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>
will be -<i>2x<sup>3</sup></i>. <i>3x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i> and -<i>2x<sup>3</sup>y</i>.
Let me see if I got that right, because you guys have been catching me too many
times. Okay, I think that's all right. This force is guaranteed to be
conservative. I will show you why this is true. </p>
<p>Why is this magic
working? But let me write it in another way that's more compact. So the force
I want to get, written as a vector, is <i>i</i> times <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>,
which is <i>i</i> times &#8722;<i>du</i>/<i>dx</i> + <i>j</i> times &#8722;<i>du</i>/<i>dy</i>.
That's the force I claim is conservative. We're going to write that as - grad <i>U</i>.
This is called the grad and it means gradient, and this symbol is shorthand for
this. There's nothing more to it. Gradient is a machine. Derivative is a
machine. You give it a function, sin <i>x</i>, it gives you an output, cosine <i>x</i>.
you give it <i>x</i> squared, it gives you 2<i>x</i>. Gradient is a different
kind of machine. You feed into it a function <i>U</i> <i>of x</i> and <i>y</i>,
and it gives you a vector in all of the <i>xy</i> plane obtained by taking the
two derivatives, one along <i>x</i> and one along <i>y</i>, and assembling them
into a single vector. </p>
<p>So let's see for this
particular <i>U</i>, the force we have = -<i>i</i> times 3<i>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i>,
+ -<i>j</i> times 2<i>x<sup>3</sup>y</i>. Amazingly, it is claimed that this
force, when you integrate it from one point to another, answer will not depend
on the path; it will depend only on the end points. So we have to understand
what makes this work. Before I show that, I will make another statement. I
will show you why this works, but the second statement, I will not prove, which
is that all conservative forces are of the form - grad <i>U</i>. In other
words, not only is this an example of conservative force, that's it. There are
no more examples. Every conservative force you cook up will always be--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Does the <i>j</i>
component ___________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti

<i>j</i> component should be what? Oh, that's negative. I think I erased it.
How's that? Thank you. Is that what you meant?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay. So how are you guys doing with this? I'm always worried. You are
inscrutable, and I don't know what's going on in there, whether silence means
&quot;I'm with you&quot; or silence means, &quot;I'm so far behind, I don't
even know where to start telling you my problems.&quot; I don&#39;t know. But
this is your class. If you don't speak up, you don't get service. You have to
ask. Don't assume people next to you know anything. I've met them. They
don't. So just speak up. All right. So it's like one of these psychotherapy
sessions. Turn to the person next to you and insult him or her, because that's
what you want to do. Don't worry about them, okay. </p>
<p>When you go to
physics seminar, you never assume the speaker has a problem. I mean, you
assume that you don't have a problem. If you don't follow it, it's a problem
with the speaker. That's what makes seminars exciting. It's the closest thing
we have to gladiator fights in the old days. You bring a speaker from
somewhere, maybe Harvard, then you put them on the stage and you just roast
them for the whole hour. Now you can do that to me just fine, because this is
not even my discovery. Somebody else did it hundreds of years ago. You should
relish that challenge. If this was a small seminar, you will have time to do
it. I don't have that much time, but I also don't have that little time that
if you don't follow me, you cannot intervene. </p>
<p>Okay, you have a
question? No. Okay. Now we are going to understand why a force manufactured
in this fashion is conservative, okay? So let's calculate integral <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> for this force from
some starting--I'm just going to call it 1 and 2. It means <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. What is <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>? It is <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx</i> + <i>F<sub>y</sub>dy</i>.
That's the meaning of the dot product. I hope you know what I mean by this.
I'm going from here to here, that vector <i>dr</i> is some amount of <i>dx</i>
and some amount of <i>dy</i>. It's got <i>j</i><i>dy</i> and <i>i</i><i>dx</i>.
And <i>F</i> is some other thing, pointing in that direction, so <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> is this. Just look
at this part. This is what you're integrating. That becomes, except for this
- sign, <i>dU</i>/<i>dx</i> times <i>dx</i> + <i>dU</i>/<i>dy</i> times <i>dy</i>.
Now what is that? What is that? What do you think it stands for? In 1
dimension, if I took <i>df</i>/<i>dx</i> times <i>dx</i>, what am I
calculating? Come on guys, you know what the derivative means. When you
multiply the derivative by some <i>dx</i>, what do you get? Pardon me? Yes, go
ahead. Take a shot. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You're getting
what you originally ___________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You're finding the change in the function <i>f</i>, right? The change in the
function <i>f</i> is <i>df</i>/<i>dx</i> times <i>dx</i>. There are other
changes proportional to <i>dx<sup>3</sup></i> and <i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>, but
for small <i>dx</i>, that's all it is. That's the meaning of the rate of
change. If you multiply the rate of change by the change you get a change in
the function. If you're in 2 dimensions, if you move from one point to another
point, you've got a function <i>U</i> that depends on <i>x</i> and on <i>y</i>.
Therefore it changes, because you change <i>x</i> and it changes because you
change <i>y</i>. It's changing because of two reasons. This is the change due
to change in <i>x</i>; that's the change due to change in <i>y</i>. For very small,
infinitesimal <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i>, that is the change. </p>
<p>That is just the
change in the function <i>U</i>. It follows then that if you add up all these <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>&#39;s from 1 to 2, this
integral will give me <i>U<sub>1</sub></i> - <i>U<sub>2</sub></i>. Therefore
integral <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2 is <i>U<sub>1</sub></i>
- <i>U<sub>2</sub></i>. So the magic is the following: you pick a function <i>U</i>,
you can think of the function <i>U</i> as measured perpendicular to the
blackboard. It's like a height or something coming out of the blackboard. You
cooked up a force which is related to the rate of change of the function <i>U</i>,
so that if you add all the <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>&#8216;s, you're getting the change in the function between two
points. And that change in the function is independent of how you got there. </p>
<p>Think of <i>U</i> as
a height of a mountain, sitting on top of the <i>xy</i> plane. Then <i>F</i>
is really proportional to the rate of change of the height of the mountain.
And <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> is the change when
you move a distance <i>dr</i>, a vector distance <i>dr</i>. You add all the
changes, what are you adding? You're adding the height, your elevation. And
when you're done, the total change is the height difference between the final
point and the starting point. It doesn't depend on how you climb that
mountain. You can take a long path, you can take a short path. </p>
<p>As long as you're
keeping track of how many feet have I climbed, you're going to get only one
answer. So not every <i>F</i> has this property, but an <i>F</i> derived from <i>U</i>
by that trick of taking the gradient has this property. Therefore for that <i>F</i>,
you might say this is for conservative force. But we always knew <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> is <i>K<sub>2</sub></i>
- <i>K<sub>1</sub></i>, therefore we get <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>U<sub>1</sub></i>
= <i>K<sub>2</sub> </i>+ <i>U<sub>2</sub></i>. In other words, the <i>U</i>
that you began with is the potential energy for that problem. So what you're
manufacturing is pairs of potentials and forces. For every <i>U</i> that you
dream up, there's a force, which is obtained by gradient, - gradient of <i>U</i>.
And in that problem, where that force is acting on particles, the energy that
is conserved will be the kinetic, + the function <i>U</i> at the starting
point, will be equal to kinetic plus potential at the end point. And the
interesting thing is, there are no other conservative forces, except forces you
can get by taking a <i>U</i> and taking its gradient. </p>
<p>So all conservative
forces fall under this category, and they all have a conserved quantity where
the potential energy is the <i>U</i> from which the <i>F</i> is derived. So we
can say it as follows: <i>F</i> = - gradient of <i>U</i>. The gradient is the
combination of <i>i</i>times the <i>x </i>derivative and <i>j</i>times the <i>y
</i>derivative. And <i>U</i> at 2 - <i>U</i> at 1 is - integral <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2. This
is the 2 dimensional generalization of something I wrote in 1 dimension
somewhere. Oh, way on the top. Here, <i>F</i> = - <i>dU</i> /<i>dx</i>, <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>)
&#8722; <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>) is - integral of <i>F</i>. The only difference
is the integrand has become this <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>, rather than the <i>F<sub>x</sub> dx</i>. So you can
get conservation of energy in higher dimensions for those forces that come from
a potential. <i>U</i> is called a potential. <i>U</i> is called a potential
energy. </p>
<p>So now we can ask the
following question: suppose I give you a force. I know if it's conservative or
not. How are you going to find out? Now there are two options. One is, you
are so smart, you can look at the function and say, &quot;Hey, this is the
gradient of some other function <i>U</i>.&quot; If you do that, then you are
done, because if it's the gradient of some function, we know it's
conservative. But what if you cannot see that right away? With simple
polynomials, you can easily guess. Like the example I gave you, if <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>
is -3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> is -<i>2x</i><sup>3</sup><i>y</i>,
maybe you can guess that <i>U </i>is <i>x</i><sup>3</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup>.
But for more complicated functions, you won't be able to do it. So there's a
process for testing any force to see if it's conservative. And the process is
the following. </p>
<p>It argues as
follows: <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> is &#8722;<i>dU</i>/<i>dx</i>. <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>
is -<i>dU</i>/<i>dy</i>. Then consider <i>dF<sub>x</sub></i>/<i>dy</i>, which
is -<i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i>/<i>dydx</i>. Then consider <i>dF<sub>y</sub></i>/<i>dx</i>,
which is -<i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i>/<i>dxdy</i>. And it's the property of partial
derivatives that the cross derivative, second cross derivative, is independent
of whether you take <i>dydx </i>or <i>dxdy</i>. So let's go to our test case, <i>U</i>
= <i>x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i>. <i>dU</i>/<i>dx</i> = 3<i>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i>
and <i>dU</i>/<i>dy</i> = 2<i>x<sup>3</sup>y</i>. Now I'm saying, take the <i>x</i>
derivative of this <i>y</i> derivative. That's written as <i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i>/<i>dydx</i>.
<i>y</i> derivative of the <i>x</i> derivative gives me 6<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i>.
Then I say take the <i>x</i> derivative of the <i>y</i> derivative. This gives
me 3<i>x<sup>2</sup></i>. That means 6<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i>. So cross
derivatives are always equal. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is this _______ if
we're going ________ taking __________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, that's correct. So in 2 dimensions, this is the only test you have to
apply. The test you have to apply is, are the cross derivatives of the force
equal? Namely, is the <i>y</i> derivative of the force <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> =
to <i>x </i>derivative of <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>? You want to see if <i>dF<sub>x</sub></i>/<i>dy</i>
= <i>dF<sub>y</sub>/dx</i>. If that is true, it is conservative. And it comes
from the fact that if <i>F</i> is the derivative of some function <i>U</i>,
then this mix derivative being equal is a diagnostic for that. In 3 dimensions,
there are 2 more equations. We're not going to use them, but I'll just mention
what they are. You get that by moving every index 1 notch. So this <i>x</i>
goes to <i>y</i>, this <i>y</i> goes to <i>z</i>, this <i>y </i>goes to <i>z</i>,
this <i>x </i>goes to <i>y</i>. </p>
<p>There's one more
condition. And another condition, <i>z</i> goes back to <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>
goes <i>z</i>--let's see, <i>y</i> goes to <i>z</i>, <i>z</i> goes to <i>x</i>
= <i>dF<sub>x</sub></i>/<i>dz</i>. I'm not worried about whether you write this
down or not, but I do want you to know in 2 dimensions, you have to remember
this condition. So this mathematic extends to all dimensions, but I'm doing it
for the case of 2D. </p>
<p>So let's take stock
of what has been done. What has been done is to think from scratch on how to
get the law of conservation of energy in high dimensions. You start with the
kinetic energy and you ask, why does it change? And you find it changes due to
the force, and you find the change in kinetic energy is the line integral of <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from start to
finish. </p>
<p>But that doesn't give
you a work energy--it gives you a work energy theorem, but not a law of
conservation of energy, because this integral can depend on the path. Then you
say, maybe there are some functions for which the answer depends only on the
end points. Then we get a law of conservation of energy, and we found out that
we can manufacture such functions at will, by taking any function of <i>U</i>,
taking its gradient, or - the gradient. Therefore that's a way to generate
conservative forces and they are the only conservative forces there are. </p>
<p>There's no other
conservative forces which are not gradients of something. And the relation
between the potential and the force, you should know now. It's what you
learned in 1D, suitably generalized to higher dimensions. Change in potential
is this and the forces obtained from the potential by taking the gradient, the
change in potential is obtained by integrating the force. If you ever get
confused about + sign and - sign and so on, go back to the harmonic oscillator,
for which the thing is 1 over--is <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>/2. </p>
<p>So let me give you
one simple example that we all know, which is the force of gravity near the
earth. So here is the earth, so there is some <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
coordinates, and here is <i>z</i>. So I might as well write down the answer,
because you guys all know this. <i>U</i> for gravity is <i>mg</i> times <i>z.</i>
And the force of gravity, which is -<i>i</i><i>du</i>/<i>dx</i> - <i>j</i><i>du</i>/<i>dy</i>,
- <i>k</i><i>du</i>/<i>dz</i>, all you got here is -<i>k</i><i>mg</i>, because
it doesn't depend on <i>x</i>, it doesn't depend on <i>y</i>. It depends only
on <i>z</i> and the <i>z</i> derivative is trivial. Force is -<i>mg</i>
pointing down. So the force is the gradient of the potential and you can ask,
is the potential difference between two points, <i>U<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>U<sub>1</sub></i>,
is it equal to integral of <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2? You can easily check that. </p>
<p>If you go from here
to here, straight up, then the integral of -<i>mg</i> times <i>dz</i> from
start to finish, with a - sign is just <i>mgz</i> - 0. So indeed, it is true.
And if you took two points, not on top of each other, but something like this,
you can always do the integral from here to here, where there's no change in
potential, and do the integral there, which will give the same answer. So
gravity's a very trivial example, a very easy case, but you can see that gravitation
is a conservative force. And you can see why it's a conservative force,
because if you took a path where you went like this, let's say, and you went
like this, where you get the same answer as here and here. Because in this
path and this path, you don't do any work, because <i>F</i> and <i>dr</i> are
perpendicular, right? <i>F</i> is like this, and the displacement is like
that, and it's the same thing, whereas here, if you go like this, <i>F</i> is
down and <i>dr</i> is down, <i>F</i> is down, <i>dr</i> is down, and it's the
same <i>F</i> here and here; are the same height so you get the same answer. </p>
<p>Okay, but now, why
did we spend quite a bit of time on conservative forces, because that's not
what the primary focus is? It was electricity and electrostatics. So we've
got to ask ourselves, does the electrostatic force meet the test of a
conservative force? Well, we know it will, because otherwise I wouldn't have
spent this much time building up the stuff. But let's just verify that. It
looks like a very formidable task. Let's see why it's a formidable task to
verify it's conservative. I'm claiming that you've got all kinds of these
charges producing a field here and I want to prove that the line integral of
this force on any closed loop is 0. Or I want to prove the integral on one
path is the integral on any other path, for any 2 paths between any 2 points.
I don't have time to show all that, right? If the theorem is wrong, do you
agree it may not be so hard to show that? What will it take to show it is not
conservative? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Just 2 paths for
which the integral is not equal.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. If you pick any 2 paths, should be the same end points, so always the
integral is not equal, that's it. But the fact that they were equal doesn't
mean that somebody else will not find some other two paths with some other
starting points which they are not equal. So how are we going to do this? How
are we going to test for every configuration of electric field, every element
of charges is conservative? So what do you think a strategy will be? Yes?
Any ideas? How am I going to take all possible charges and work it out each
time? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I guess you could
find the electric field and use that test to see--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right, but to find the electric field and see if it works, you have to
calculate the electric field as a function of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>
for every arrangement of charges. Then you can ask, is that true, those
derivatives? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> But what works for
one charge should work for all charges, because of supersposition.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There we go. If it works for one charge, it will work for any arrangement of
charges. So you may not have appreciated fully the power of superposition, but
you can see now. If you did not realize that, the problem looks
insurmountable. Who can handle every arrangement of charges? But if charge by
charge it is true that the electric field due to charge 1 is conservative,
electric field due to charge 2 is conservative. When I add them up, the net
field is <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>. The line integral of <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>
+ <i>E<sub>2 </sub></i>is the line integral of <i>E<sub>1</sub></i><sub> </sub>+
the line integral of <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>. <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> gives 0 on any
closed loop, other will give 0 on any closed loop. The trick is going to be
just do it for one charge. That's it. If you can see it for one charge, you
get by superposition that it's true for any charge, because the field is
additive and the integral is additive, okay. That's the two parts. If you've
got charges, the net <i>e</i> is <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>.
The integral of <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>E<sub>2 </sub></i>is the integral of <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>
+ the integral of <i>E<sub>2</sub>.</i> </p>
<p>That's the way
integrals work. If each one vanishes on a closed loop, you're done. So I'm
just going to take one charge. Here's one charge and let me draw for
convenience all the field lines coming out of it. Then I want to see, if I do
a line integral, say from here to here, will I get the same answer on some
other path? Let's test that. So the first integral is from 1 to 2 on this
path. Then I'm going to take another one, which is different from it, where
you can see the answer is the same, then go on making more and more changes,
and the answer will not change. </p>
<p>So I'm going to take
another path where I go tangent to the lines, along a circle. Then I go here,
till I get to that radius, then I turn around and do that. I claim the
integral will be the same on this path, this one, that one and that one. So I
want you to think about why it's going to be true, okay? Think of it, why it's
okay to do that. You've got a new path but it doesn't make a difference.
Ready? Tell you the answer now? How many people don't know why it's true? So
other people know why it's true. I'm going to ask the other people. Okay, why
is it true?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I raised my hand.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You raised your hand. All right. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's true, because
when you're moving on the paths this way, they're radial, so the radius is
constant, which would mean that there's no _______.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There's no what?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> There's no change
in force because the radius is constant.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's not a good reason. The force is changing. It's that way there, it's
that way there. Why is it not?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's always
perpendicular to the force.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The force and the displacement are perpendicular in this section, because force
is radial, displacement by definition is tangential along the circle. So <i>dr</i>
is perpendicular to <i>F</i>. Oh, by the way, I should tell you something. I
usually forget this. We want the electric force to be conservative, right?
The electric force in any situation on a charge is <i>q</i> times the electric
field. </p>
<p>You will agree that
if the electric field is conservative, multiplying by a number <i>q</i> is not
going to change the fact. So I'm going to prove the electric field is
conservative, then the electric force on any charge is just proportional to
it. It will also be conservative. So really taking force on a unit charge and
seeing what happens. So this section is for free. This section--we'll come to
that--this section is also for free, because <i>F</i> looks like that and <i>dr</i>
looks like that. Here you can pair the sections, so that that section is
paired with that section, because you're moving the same radial distance with a
radial force. <i>F</i> &#8901;<i>dr</i>, the dot product, is
the same here, section by section. </p>
<p>Any work you're doing
here, you're doing here, therefore the answer is the same. Then you can see
that you can go on adding all kinds of changes, radial and angle, radial or
angular, and when you're done, all the radial integrals will give you that
part, and the angulars won't count. So as you move around, it's only when
you're moving radially you're even aware that you're doing work. Going in the
angle doesn&#39;t matter. And the net radial change in going from here to here is
that distance, no matter how you move. Now you might say, prove to me that
that integral is the same as that integral, because this was made up of radial
and angular sections. </p>
<p>This doesn't seem
that way, but we can always make a very fine mesh in which every displacement
is approximated by radial angle or radial angular. So you can approximate any
contour by sequence of radial and angular moves. Angular moves are free.
Radial moves keep track of the change in the distance times the force and you
can pair them with this reference. Every <i>dr</i> we move there we have a <i>dr</i>
here. So that is the pictorial proof of this. So let's now calculate what is
the potential due to that electric field. </p>
<p>So we're going to do
the calculation. So we use the formula that <i>U</i> at <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> -
<i>U</i> at <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> is - the integral <i>e</i>&#8901;<i>dr</i> from 1 to 2. You
see, we know it is conservative. I've shown you with this argument. So if you
want to find the potential energy between 1 and 2, you can take any path you
like between 1 and 2. So let's pick the points. Here is point 1 and here is
point 2. You can pick any path you like, so here is what I'm going to do. I'm
going to go radially out and then I'm going to go along the arc. So this is 1,
this is 2, but I'm going to start at some intermediate point 3, then go right.
</p>
<p>So work is done here;
no work is done there. So let's just find the work in going from 1 to 3, which
is -<i>e<sub>r</sub></i> (is a vector in the radial direction) &frac14;<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
That is <i>F</i> . The displacement is <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> times the little
length of <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>. Do you understand that? A tiny section here, <i>dr</i>,
has a magnitude equal to the change in the radius, and a direction equal to the
radius unit rate--the radial direction. And you want to do this from <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
to <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. Okay, <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>&#8901;<i>e<sub>r</sub></i> is 1 so I get--I
forgot one thing. You guys know what I forgot here? One thing's missing. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>Q</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
When did you notice that? Just now?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Little bit. </p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Don't wait. Don't wait even one second. I told you what happens to me, right?
When I go home, they tie me to a stool and they force me to watch this tape.
And it's just awful when you think you dropped a symbol, and you're waiting for
somebody to say, &quot;Hey, what about <i>q</i>?&quot; So don't have any--if
you hesitate, it's only to wait, not to stop me. All right, so look, I'll get
the <i>q</i> because I know the formula from the time I was in a sandbox. I
know something is wrong, but I don't want to get to that last stage, then go
back and change everything. </p>
<p>So I forgot the <i>q</i>
sitting at the origin here. Okay, so this is <i>q</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>.
Integral of -1/r<sup>2</sup> is just 1/<i>r</i>, so that's 1/<i>r<sub>2</sub></i>
&#8722; 1/<i>r<sub>1</sub></i>. Again, sorry, I made a mistake now. The change in
potential energy is really <i>q</i> times <i>e</i>, but <i>q</i> is the test
charge, so I'm going to call this <i>V</i>. So it's hard for you guys to do it
on the notebook, because I want to distinguish between potential energy and
potential. In other words, the force--now some other test charge <i>q</i> is the
electric field times <i>q</i>. And the force is going to be - the gradient of
the potential energy. The electric field is going to be - the gradient of the
potential. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> In that last line,
should that be a negative?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
A negative?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Let's see. There's a negative here, and integral of -1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> is
1/<i>r</i>.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So the upper limit, then there's lower limit. So let me correct what I said.
I'm trying to find the difference in what's called the potential. It's not the
potential energy. Potential difference between some point and some other point
is the work done on a unit charge. If you've got some other charge, you should
multiply it by the charge. So the energy of some other charge in this field,
the potential energy, is <i>q</i> times the potential. So <i>U</i> is <i>q</i>
times this thing that I'm calling potential. </p>
<p>So we're comparing
this expression to this expression, we can conclude that <i>V</i> at any point <i>r</i>
is <i>q</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>(1/<i>r</i>) + any constant. Any constant,
because you cannot immediately say this guy is equal to this guy and that guy
is equal to that guy, because even if you add a constant to both, it will still
be true. And we can pick the constant any way we like. It is common to pick
the constant so that <i>V</i> goes to 0 as <i>r</i> goes to infinity. That's
what we will do. That's the convention. Then we can write here, what is the <i>V</i>(<i>r</i>).
</p>
<p>This is the <i>V</i>
due to a single charge, and the <i>U</i>(<i>r</i>) = to some <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.
I don't want to call <i>q</i> again, because <i>q</i> is the guy producing the
potential. <i>q<sub>0</sub></i> is the guy experiencing the force. So <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>
times <i>V</i> is the potential energy of charge <i>q</i>, of charge <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>
sitting at that point. Now let's also verify, if you like, that this <i>V</i>(<i>r</i>)<i>
</i>does produce the electric field. In other words, I got the <i>V</i> by
integrating electric field. I want to go back, just to get you familiar with
this. Getting the electric field from the potential. Let's try to do that.
So <i>E<sub>x</sub></i>--let me just do <i>E<sub>x</sub></i>--it's &#8722;<i>dV</i>/<i>dx</i>,
right? -<i>dV</i> /<i>dx</i> = -<i>q</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. Derivative
of 1/<i>r</i> is -1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>dr</i>/<i>dx</i>. What is <i>dr</i>/<i>dx</i>?
<i>r </i>is (<i>x<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>y<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>z<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>1/2</sup>.
<i>dr</i>/<i>dx</i> is just <i>x</i> divided by this whole thing, is <i>x </i>divided
by <i>r</i>. So this becomes <i>q</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>(1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>)(<i>x</i>/<i>r</i>).
This is <i>E<sub>x</sub></i>. </p>
<p>So what will be the
vector <i>e</i>? Can you do that in your head? Multiply this by <i>i</i>, and
do similarly for <i>y</i> and <i>z </i>and add them up. What will you find?
You will find E will equal q/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>(1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>),
times <i>r</i> over <i>r</i>. Put <i>r</i> over <i>r</i>, position vector over
<i>r</i>, is the unit vector in the radial direction. I'm doing this a little
fast, because this is something you can go home and check. I don't want to
spend too much time doing it. I claim that if you took this potential and took
its <i>x </i>derivative or <i>y</i> derivative or <i>z</i> derivative, you get
the <i>x, y</i> or <i>z </i>components of the electric field. </p>
<p>Okay, if you didn't
follow this, you should go home and check that this is true. All right, so
this is not that important for me, this checking, because we know it's going to
work. What is important for me is for you to know that we've now found that
the potential due to a single charge leads to a conservative force. The field
due to a single charge leads to a conservative one, therefore by superposition,
if you add any number of charges, if you find the potential due to all of them,
then you take its gradient that will give you a conservative electric field. </p>
<p>So what have you got
so far? Our gain is the following: we have a law of conservation of energy,
which is the following: &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>q</i> (this <i>q</i> is the
<i>q</i> of the body you're interested in) times <i>V</i> at the point <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
= &frac12;<i>mv<sub>2</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>q</i> times <i>v </i>at the point <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>.
And what is <i>V</i> at any point<i> r</i>? It's the sum 1/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>.
Let's imagine there are many, many charges, <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>2</sub>,
q<sub>3</sub></i>, each one <i>at r<sub>1</sub></i>,<i> r<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>r<sub>3</sub></i>,
etc. This equals <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> which is charge number I divided by the
length of the vector from <i>r<sub>i</sub> </i>to the <i>r</i> where I'm
finding the potential. In other words, this is where I want the potential <i>r</i>.
This is <i>r<sub>1</sub></i><sub> </sub>and <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> is sitting
there. This is <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i><sub> </sub>is
sitting there and so on. And the potential at the point that I'm interested in
is obtained by taking each <i>q</i> divided by the distance from that point,
and this is the usual 1/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. </p>
<p>That is the complete
story, and the charges are not discrete but continuous you can write an
integral. So every problem, you first find the potential by adding the
potential from all the charges. Then its gradient will give it the electric
field. But we have now a law of conservation of energy with this as the
conserved energy. The second advantage is that it is easier to work with <i>V</i>
than with <i>E</i>. So why do you think it's easier to find <i>V</i> and then
find <i>E </i>from it, by taking derivatives than the other way around? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>V</i> is a
scalar.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's always easier
to take derivatives than to integrate--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. Yes. Let me repeat that. If you want to find the potential due to
many charges, you simply add the numbers coming from each one. There are no
arrows, there are no vectors. Notice the formula for <i>V</i> has no vectors
in it. Each one contributes a number. Each charge contributes a number to the
point they're interested in. Add them all up, find the number here, there,
everywhere else. Then take derivatives of your answer to get the field.
That's going to be a lot easier than adding the vectors. </p>
<p>So I'm going to
illustrate that with one simple problem and that's the last thing for today.
That's the dipole. So here is our dipole. Let's take a charge <i>q</i>, -<i>q</i>
at -<i>a</i> and +<i>q</i> at +<i>a</i>. And we want to find the field there.
So let's call that distance <i>r</i><sub>+</sub> and let's call that distance <i>r</i><sub>-</sub>.
These are not vectors; these are just lengths. If you want to find the
electric field directly, you know what you have to do. You have to find the
vector here and you've got to find the vector there due to the second guy, add
the two vectors and find the result. Of course, you can do it, but it's going
to be very tedious, because you have to find the direction of the vector here
and the direction of the vector here, in terms of all these coordinates. </p>
<p>What we will do
instead is to find the potential everywhere, and take the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
derivatives of the potential to get the <i>E<sub>x</sub> </i>and <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>.
Well, let's do that. So let's find the total potential due to these two guys.
The first one is q/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> divided by 1/<i>r<sub>+</sub></i> - 1/<i>r<sub>-</sub>.</i>
That's it. Just wanted to simplify the expression a little bit. So this is
true for any separation, but I want the limit in which <i>r<sub>+</sub></i> and
<i>r<sub>-</sub></i> are much bigger than the separation between them. </p>
<p>So let's define an <i>r</i>
which is the position vector of the point you're interested in from the center
of the dipole. So we've got to find <i>r<sub>+</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>-</sub></i>.
You get that, you're done. So vector <i>r<sub>+</sub></i>you can
see = <i>r</i><i> </i>- <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2 and vector <i>r<sub>-</sub></i> =
vector <i>r</i> + <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2. Because the vector <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2
looks like this, so <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2 + <i>r<sub>+</sub></i> should give you <i>r</i>.
You can check that. And you can check that <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2 + <i>r</i> gives
you <i>r<sub>-</sub></i>. so these are the two expressions. So what is <i>r<sub>+</sub></i>?
<i>r<sup>+</sup></i> is the length of the vector <i>r<sub>+</sub></i>. That's
equal to the square root of the length squared. The length squared of <i>r<sub>+</sub></i>
squared = root of (<i>r</i> - <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2) &#8901; (<i>r</i> - <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2).</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Why is it <i>a</i><i>i</i>/2?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, I'm sorry, it's not. It is half the distance, but it's really only a.
Thank you. Yeah, in fact, one puts the 2<i>a</i> as a separation to avoid all
these factors of 2. So now you take the length squared. It's equal to <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> minus twice <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>. The other one would be <i>r<sup>2</sup> </i>+
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i> + twice <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>. And that we can approximate as <i>r</i> times 1 -
twice <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>to the 1 half. I'll tell you what I did here. I'm going to neglect <i>a</i>
squared compared to <i>r</i> squared, because <i>r </i>is much bigger than it.
</p>
<p>But I'm going to keep
this <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i> term because this
has got two powers of <i>a</i>, where <i>a</i> is a small number. It's got 1
power of <i>a</i> and 1 power of <i>r</i>, so it's much stronger than this term,
so I keep that. Keeping the second term, so I've forgotten the <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>
term. In this one, from the theorem I've been giving you guys all the time,
it's 1 - <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>/r<sup>2</sup>.
Remember 1 + <i>x<sup>n</sup> </i>is roughly 1 + <i>nx</i> + dot dot dot if <i>x</i>
is small, and <i>x</i> is indeed small, because it's <i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i> over <i>r</i>
squared. So now we can see <i>V</i> = <i>q</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>{1/[r(1-<i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>/r<sup>2</sup>)] - 1/[r(1+<i>r</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>a</i>/r<sup>2</sup>)]} . </p>
<p>This is going to be
found in every textbook in the planet, so don't worry about it. If you
simplify this again by taking it upstairs, you'll get twice <i>a</i>&#8901;<i>r</i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
That's the potential. Now twice <i>a</i> times <i>q </i>is the dipole moment,
so it's <i>p</i>&#8901;<i>r</i>/4<i>&#928;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>r<sup>3</sup>.
That's the final piece, the dipole moment. Dipole moment is a charge times the
separation between the charges, which is 2<i>a</i> times <i>q</i>. Okay, so
what one should do now is, having taken this <i>V</i>, one can take its <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> derivatives very easily to calculate the electric field at each
point. It's very easy to take the derivative of this, just pick the <i>x</i>
or <i>y</i>. It's one of the homework problems I've assigned to you, where I
show you the dipole field. So the moral of the story is, add the potential due
to all the charges, then take the derivative, because derivatives are easier to
take. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The condition for
that result, is <i>r</i> much bigger than <i>a</i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. Up till some point, everything is exact, but then this is long distance
property. Any questions? Okay, thank you.</p>
