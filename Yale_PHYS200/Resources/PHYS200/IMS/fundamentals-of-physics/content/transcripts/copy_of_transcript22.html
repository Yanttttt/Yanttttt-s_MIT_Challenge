<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Alright, you guys ready for a
lecture two on heat and thermo? So, I had to leave you in the middle of
something pretty exciting, so I'll come back and take it from there.
So, what is it you have to remember from last time? You know, what are
the main ideas I covered? One is, we took the notion of temperature,
for which we have an intuitive feeling and turned it into something
more quantitative, so you can not only say this is hotter than that,
that's hotter than this, you can say by how much, by how many degrees.
And in the end we agreed to use the absolute Kelvin scale for
temperature.</p>

<p>And the way to find the Kelvin scale, you take the gas, any gas that
you like, like hydrogen or helium, at low concentration, and put that
inside a piston and cylinder. That will occupy some volume and there's
a certain pressure by putting weights on top, and you take the product
of <i>P</i> times <i>V</i>, and the claim is for whatever gas you take,
it'll be a straight line. Remember now, this is in Kelvin. Your
centigrade scale is somewhere over here, but I've shifted the origin to
the Kelvin scale. So, somewhere here will be the boiling point of
water, somewhere the freezing point of water; that may be the boiling
point of water. And if you took a different amount of a different gas,
you'll get some other line. But they will always be straight lines if
the concentration is sufficiently low.</p>

<p>In other words, it appears that pressure times volume is some
constant. I don't know what to call it. Say <i>c</i>, times this
temperature. And you can use that to measure temperature because if you
know two points on a straight line then you know that you can find the
slope and then you can calibrate the thermometer, then for any other
value of <i>P</i> times <i>V</i> that you get, you can come down and
read your temperature. That's the preferred scale, and we prefer this
scale because it doesn't seem to depend on the gas that you use. I can
use one; you can use another one. People in another planet who have
never heard of water--they can use a different gas. But all gases seem
to have the property that pressure times volume is linearly
proportional to this new temperature scale, measured with this new
origin at absolute zero. There is really nothing to the left of this
<i>T</i> = 0.</p>

<p>The next thing I mentioned was, people used to think of the theory
of heat as a new theory. You know, we got mechanics and all that
stuff--levers and pulleys and all that. Then, you have this mysterious
thing called heat, which has been around for many years but people
started quantifying it by saying there's a fluid called the caloric
fluid and hot things have a lot of it, and cold things have less of it,
and when you mix them the caloric somehow flows from the hot to the
cold. Then we defined specific heat, law of conservation of this
caloric fluid that allows you to do some problems in calorimetry. You
mix so much of this with so much of that, where will they end up? That
kind of problem.</p>

<p>So, that promoted heat to a new and independent entity, different
from all other things we have studied. But something suggests that it
is not completely alien or a new concept, because there seems to be a
conservation of law for this heat, because the heat lost by the cold
water was the heat gained by the hot water. I'm sorry. Heat gained by
the cold water was the heat lost by the hot water. So, you have a
conservation law.</p>

<p>Secondly, we know another way to produce heat. Instead of saying put
it on the stove, put it on the stove, in which case, there is something
mysterious flowing from the stove into the water that heats it up, I
told you there's a different thing you can do. Take two automobiles;
slam them. This is not the most economical way to make your dinner but
I'm just telling you as a matter of principle. Buy two Ferraris, slam
them into each other and take this pot and put it on top and it'll heat
up because Ferraris will heat up.</p>

<p>The question is what happened to the kinetic energy of the two cars?
That is really gone. So, in the old days, we would say, well, we don't
apply the Law of Conservation of Energy because this was an inelastic
relationship. That was our legal way out of the whole issue. But you
realize now this caloric fluid can be produced from nowhere, because
there was no caloric fluid before, but slamming the two cars produce
this extra heat. So, that indicates that perhaps there's a relation
between mechanical energy and heat energy--that when mechanical energy
disappears, heat energy appears.</p>

<p>So, how do you do the conversion ratio? You know, how many calories
can you get if you sacrifice one joule of mechanical energy? So, Joule
did the experiment. Not with cars. I mean, he didn't have cars at that
time, so if he did he would've probably done it with cars. He had this
gadget with him, which is a little shaft with some paddles and a pulley
on the top, and you let the weight go down. And I told you guys the
weight goes from here to here, the <i>mgh</i> loss will not be the gain
in ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. Something will be missing. Keep track of
the missing amount. So many joules--but meanwhile you find this water
has become hot. You find then how many calories should have gone in,
because we know the specific of water, we know the rise in temperature,
we know how many calories were produced. And then, you compare the two
and you find that 4.2 joules = 1 calorie. So, that is the conversion
ratio of calories to joules. One joule, 4.2 joules of mechanical
energy.</p>

<p>So, in the example of the colliding cars, take the ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> for each car, turn it into joules, slam them
together. If they come to rest, you've lost all of that, and then you
take that and you write it as--divided by 4.2 and that's how much
calories you have produced. If the car was made of just one material,
it had a specific heat, then it would go up by a certain temperature
you can actually predict.</p>

<p>Okay. So today, I want to go a little deeper into the question of
where is the energy actually stored in the car, and what is heat. We
still don't know in detail what heat is. We just said car heats up and
the loss of joules divided by 4.2 is the gain in calories. Now, we can
answer in detail exactly what is heat. That's what we're going to talk
about today. When we say something is hotter, what do we mean on a
microscopic level? In the old days when people didn't know what
anything was made of, they didn't have this understanding. And the
understanding that I'm going to give you today is based on a simple
fact that everything is made up of atoms. That was not known, and
that's one of the greatest discoveries that, in the end, everything is
made up of atoms, and atoms combine to form molecules and so on.</p>

<p>So, how does that come into play? For that, I want you to take the
simple example where the temperature enters. That is in the relation
<i>PV</i> equal to some constant times temperature. Do you know what
I'm talking about? Take some gas, make sure it's sufficiently dilute,
put it into this piston, measure the weights on top of it, divide it by
the area, to get the pressure, that's the pressure, that's the volume.
The volume is the region here, multiply the product; then, if you heat
up the gas by putting it on some hot plate, you'll find the product
<i>PV</i> increases, and as the temperature increases, <i>PV</i> is
proportional to <i>T</i>. We want to ask what is this proportionality
constant. Suppose you were doing this. In the old days, this is what
people did. What did we think should be on the right-hand side? What is
going to control this particular constant for the given experiment? Do
you know what it might be proportional to? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Amount of gas?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Amount of gas. That's true,
because if the amount of gas is zero, we think there's no pressure.
When you say "amount of gas," that's a very safe sentence because
amount measured by what means? By what metric?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Probably number of particles?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Right. Suppose you were not
aware of particles. Then, what would you mean by "amount of gas?"</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Mass.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: The mass. Now, if you guys ever
said moles, I was going to shoot you down. You're not supposed to know
those things. We are trying to deduce that. So, put yourself back in
whatever stone ages we were in. We don't know anything else. Mass would
be a reasonable argument, right? What's the argument? We know that if
you have some amount of gas producing the pressure, and you put twice
as much stuff, you would think it will produce twice as much pressure.
Same reason why you think the expansion of a rod is proportionally
change in temperature times the starting length. So, this mass is
what's doing it. So, it's proportional to mass. It's a very reasonable
guess.</p>

<p>So, if you put more gas into your piston you think it'll produce
more pressure. That's actually correct. So, let's go to that one
particular sample in your laboratory that you did. So, put the mass
that you had there. Then, you should put a constant still. I don't know
what you want me to call this constant, say, <i>c</i> prime. This
constant contains everything, but I pulled out the mass and the
remaining constant I want to call <i>c</i> prime. This is actually
correct. You can take a certain gas and you can find out what <i>c</i>
prime is.</p>

<p>But here is what people found. If you do it that way, the constant
<i>c</i> prime depends on the gas you are considering. If you consider
hydrogen gas, let's call that <i>c</i> prime for hydrogen. Somebody
else puts in helium gas. Then you find the <i>c</i> prime for helium is
one-fourth <i>c</i> prime for hydrogen. If you do carbon, it's another
number. <i>c</i> prime for carbon is <i>c</i> prime for hydrogen
divided by 12. So, each gas has a different constant. So, we conclude
that yes, it's the mass that decides it but the mass has to be divided
by different numbers for different gases to find the real effective
mass in terms of pressure. In other words, one gram of hydrogen and one
gram of helium do not have the same pressure. In fact, one gram of
helium has to be divided by 4 to find its effect on pressure.</p>

<p>So, you have to think about why is it that the mass directly is not
involved. Mass has to be divided by a number, and the number is a nice,
round number. 4 for this and 12 for that, and of course people figure
out there's a long story I cannot go into, but I think you all know the
answer. But now we are allowed to fast forward to the correct answer,
because I really don't have the time to see how they worked it out, but
from these integers and the way the gases reacted and formed
complicated molecules, they figured out what's really going on is that
you're dividing by a number that's proportional with the mass of the
underlying fundamental entity, which would be an atom. In some case a
molecule, but I'm just going to call everything as atom.</p>

<p>So, if things, like, carbon, as atoms, weigh 12 times as much as
things called hydrogen, then if you took some amount of carbon, you
divide it by a number, like, 12 to count the number of carbon atoms.
Okay, so hydrogen you want to count the number of hydrogen atoms. So
then, what really you want here is not the mass, but the number of
atoms of a given kind. We are certainly free to write either a mass or
the number of atoms, because the two are proportional. But the beauty
of writing it this way, you write it in this fashion, by this new
constant <i>k</i>, <i>k</i> is independent of the gas. So, you want to
write it in a manner in which it doesn't depend on the gas. You can
write it in terms of mass. If you did, for each mass you've got to
divide by a certain number. TThen once you divide it by the number you
can put a single constant in front. Or if you want a universal
constant, what you should really be counting is the number of atoms or
molecules.</p>

<p>So, you couldn't have written it that way until you knew about atoms
and molecules and people who are led to atoms and molecules by looking
at the way gases interact, and it's a beautiful piece of chemistry to
figure out really that there are entities which come in discreet units.
Not at all obvious in the old days, that mass comes in discreet units
called atoms, but that's what they deduced.</p>

<p>So, this is called the Boltzmann Constant. The Boltzmann Constant
has a value of 1.4 times 10<sup>-23</sup>, let's see, joules/Kelvin.
That's it. Or joules/Kelvin or degrees centigrade. So, this is a
universal constant.</p>

<p>So, now what people like to do is they don't like to write the
number [N], because if you write the number, in a typical situation,
what's the number going to be? Take some random group gas. One gram,
two grams, one kilogram, it doesn't matter. The number you will put in
there is some number like 10<sup>23</sup> or 10<sup>25</sup>. That's a
huge number. So, whenever a huge number is involved, what you try to do
is to measure the huge number as a simple multiple off another huge
number, which will be our units for measuring large numbers.</p>

<p>For example, when you want to buy eggs, you measure in dozens. When
you want to buy paper, you might want to measure it in thousands or
five hundreds or whatever unit they sell them in. It's a natural unit.
When you want to find intergalactic distances, you may use a light
year. You use units so that in that unit, the quantity of interest to
us is some number that you can count in your hands. When you count
people's height, you use feet because it's something between 1 and 8,
let's say. You don't want to use angstroms and you don't want to use
millimeters.</p>

<p>Likewise, when you want to simply count numbers, it turns out
there's a very natural number called Avogadro's Number, and Avogadro's
Number is 6 times 10<sup>23</sup>. There's no unit. It's simply a
number, and that's called a mole. So, a mole is like a dozen. We wanted
to buy 6 times 10<sup>23</sup> eggs, you will say get me one mole of
eggs. A mole is just a number. It's a huge number. You can ask yourself
what's so great about this number? Why would someone think of this
particular number? Why not some other number? Why not 10<sup>24</sup>?
Do you know what's special about this number? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. If you like, a mole is such
that one mole of hydrogen weighs one gram. And hydrogen is the simplest
element with a nucleus of just a proton and the electron's mass is
negligible. So, this, if you like, is the reciprocal of the mass of
hydrogen. In other words, one over Avogadro's Number is the mass of
hydrogen in grams, of a hydrogen atom in grams. So, you basically say,
I want to count this large number so let me take one gram, which is my
normal unit if you're thinking in grams. Then I ask, "How many hydrogen
atoms does one gram of hydrogen contain?" That's the number. That's the
mole. So, if you decide to measure the number of atoms you have in a
given problem, in terms of this number, you write it as some other
small number called moles, times the number in a mole, and you are free
to write it this way.</p>

<p>If you write it this way, then you write this <i>nRT</i>, <i>R</i>
is the universal gas constant. What's <i>n</i> times the Boltzmann
Constant. <i>N<sub>0</sub></i> times the Boltzmann Constant. That
happens to be 8.3 joules per degree centigrade or per Kelvin. Right?
The units for <i>R</i> will be <i>PV</i>, which is units of energy
divided by <i>T</i>.</p>

<p>In terms of calories, I'd remember this as a nice, round number. Two
calories per degree centigrade. Degrees centigrade and Kelvin are the
same. The origins are shifted, but when you go up by one degree in
centigrade or Kelvin, you go the same amount in temperature.</p>

<p>So, this [<i>R</i>] is what they found out first, because they
didn't know anything about atoms and so on. But later on when you go
look under the hood of what the gas is made of, if you write it in
terms of the number of actual atoms, you should use the little
<i>k</i>, or you can write it in terms of number of moles, in which
case use big <i>R</i>. And the relation between the two is simply this.
If you're thinking of a gas and how many moles of gas do I have? For
example, one gram of hydrogen would be one mole. Then you will use
<i>R</i>. If you've gone right down to fundamentals and say, "How many
atoms do I have?" and you put that here, you will multiply it by this
very tiny number.</p>

<p>Alright. Now, you start with this law and you ask the following
question. On the left-hand side is the quantity <i>P</i> times
<i>V</i>. On the right-hand side I have <i>nRT</i>, but let me write it
now as <i>NkT</i>. You guys should be able to go back and forth between
writing in terms of number of moles or the number of atoms. You'll like
this because all numbers here will be small, of the order 1. <i>R</i>
is a number like 8, in some units, and <i>n</i> would be 1 or 2 moles.
Here, this <i>N</i> will be a huge number, like 10<sup>23</sup>.
<i>k</i> will be a tiny number like 10<sup>-23</sup>. Think in terms of
atoms. That's what you do. Big numbers, small constants. When you think
of moles, moderate numbers and moderate value of constants. We want to
ask ourselves, "Is there a microscopic basis for this equation?" In
other words, once we believe in atoms, do we understand why there is a
pressure at all in a gas? That's what we're going to think about
now.</p>

<p>So, for this purpose, we will take a cube of gas. Here it is. This
is a cube of side <i>L</i> by <i>L</i> by <i>L</i>. Inside this is gas
and it's got some pressure, and I want to know what's the value of the
pressure. You've got to ask yourself, why is there pressure? Remember,
I told you what pressure means. If you take this face of the cube, for
example, it's got to be nailed down to the other faces; otherwise,
it'll just come flying out because the gas is pushing you out. The
pressure is the force on this face divided by area. So, somebody inside
is trying to get out. Those guys are the molecules or the atoms, and
what they're doing is constantly bouncing off the wall, and every time
this one bounces on a wall, its momentum changes from that to the other
one.</p>

<p>So, who's changing the momentum? Well, the wall is changing the
momentum. It's reversing it. For example, if you bounce head-on and go
back, your momentum is reversed. That means you push the wall with some
force and the wall pushes you back with the opposite force. It's the
force that you exert on the wall that I'm interested in. I want to find
the force on the wall, say, this particular face. You can find the
pressure on any face. It's going to be the same answer. I'm going to
take the shaded face to find the pressure on it.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to ask, what is the force exerted by me on any
body, I know the force has a rate of change of momentum, because that
is <i>d/dt</i> of <i>mv</i>, and <i>m</i> is a constant, and that's
just <i>dv/dt</i>, which is <i>ma</i>. I'm just using old <i>F =
ma</i>, but I'm writing it as a rate of change and momentum. Now, I
have <i>N</i> molecules or <i>N</i> atoms, randomly moving inside the
box. Each in its own direction, suffering collisions with the box,
bouncing off like a billiard ball would at the end of the pool table
and going to another wall and doing it.</p>

<p>Now, that's a very complicated problem, so we're going to simplify
the problem. The simplification is going to be, we are going to assume
that one-third of the molecules are moving from left to right.
One-third are moving up and down and one-third are moving in and out of
the blackboard. If at all you make an assumption that the molecules are
simply moving in the three primary directions, of course you will have
to give equal numbers in these directions. Nothing in the gas that
favors horizontal or vertical. In reality, of course, you must admit
the fact they move in all directions, but the simplified derivation
happens to give all the right physics, so I'm going to use that. So,
<i>N</i> over three molecules are going back and forth between this
wall, and this wall. I'm showing you a side view. The wall itself looks
like this. The molecules go back and forth.</p>

<p>Next assumption. All the molecules have the same speed, which I'm
going to call <i>v</i>. That also is a gross and crude description of
the problem, but I'm going to do that anyway and see what happens. So
now, you ask yourself the following question. Take one particular
molecule. When it hits the wall and it bounces back, its momentum
changes from <i>mv</i> to -<i>mv</i>; therefore, the change in momentum
is 2<i>mv</i>. How often does that change take place? You guys should
think about that first. How often will that collision take place? Once
you hit the wall here, you've got to go to the other wall and come
back. So, you've got to go a distance 2<i>L</i>, and you're going at a
speed <i>v</i>, the time it takes you is 2<i>L</i> over <i>v</i>. So,
<i>ΔP</i> over <i>ΔT</i> is 2<i>L</i> divided by <i>v</i>. That gives
me <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>L</i>. That is the force due to one
molecule. That's the average force. You realize it's not a continuous
force. The molecule will hit the wall, there's a little force exchange
between the two, then there's nothing, then you wait until it comes
back and hits the wall again. If that were the only thing going on,
what you would find is the wall most of the time, has no pressure and
suddenly it has a lot of pressure and then suddenly nothing. But
fortunately, this is not the only molecule. There are roughly
10<sup>23</sup> guys pounding themselves against the wall. So, at any
given instant, even if it's 10<sup>-5</sup> seconds, there'd be a large
number of molecules colliding. So, that's why the force will appear to
be steady rather than a sharp noise. It looked very steady because
somebody or other will be pushing against the wall.</p>

<p>This is the force due to one molecule. The force due to all of them
would be <i>N</i> over 3 times <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>L</i>.
<i>N</i> over 3 because of the <i>N</i> molecules, a third of them were
moving in this direction. You realize the other two directions are
parallel to the wall. They don't apply force on the wall. To apply
force on the wall, you've got to be moving perpendicular to the wall.
For example, if the planes that walls are coming out of the blackboard,
moving in and out of the blackboard doesn't produce a force on this
wall. That produces a force on the other two faces. So, as far as any
one set of faces is concerned, in one plane, only the motion orthogonal
to that is going to contribute. That's why you have <i>N</i> over
3.</p>

<p>We're almost done. That's the average force. If you want, I can
denote average by some <i>F</i> bar. Then what about the average
pressure? The average pressure is the average force divided by the area
of that face, which is <i>F</i> over <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>, that gives
me <i>N</i> over 3, <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>L<sup>3</sup></i>.
Now, this is very nice because <i>L<sup>3</sup></i> is just the volume
of my box. So, I take the <i>L<sup>3</sup></i>, which is equal to the
volume of my box, and I send it to the other side and write it as
<i>PV</i> equals <i>N</i> over 3<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>This is what the microscopic theory tells you. Microscopic theory
says, if your molecules all have a single speed, they're moving
randomly in space so that a third of them are moving back and forth
against that wall and this wall, then this is the product <i>PV</i>.
Experimentally, you find <i>PV</i> = <i>NkT</i>. So, you compare the
two expressions and out comes one of the most beautiful results, which
is that <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> over 2 is 3 over 2<i>kT</i>. Now that guy
deserves a box. Look what it's telling you. It's a really profound
formula. It tells you for the first time a real microscopic meaning of
temperature. What you and I call the temperature for gas is simply, up
to these factors, 3/2 <i>k</i>, simply the kinetic energy of the
molecules. That's what temperature is. If you've got a gas and you put
your hand into the furnace and it feels hot, the temperature you're
measuring is directly the kinetic energy of the molecules. That is a
great insight into what temperature means.</p>

<p>Remember, this is not true if <i>T</i> is measured in centigrade. If
<i>T</i> were measured in centigrade, our freezing point of water
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>, would vanish. But that's not what's implied.
<i>T</i> should be measured from absolute zero. It also tells you why
absolute zero is absolute. As you cool your gas, the kinetic energy of
molecules are decreasing and decreasing and decreasing, but you cannot
go below not moving at all, right? That's the lowest possible kinetic
energy. That's why it's absolute zero. At that point, everybody stops
moving. That's why you have no pressure.</p>

<p>Now, these results are modified by the laws of quantum mechanics,
but we don't have to worry about that now. In the classical physics,
it's actually correct to say that when the temperature goes to zero,
all motion ceases. Now, this is the picture I want you to bear in mind
when you say temperature. Absolute temperature is a measure of
molecular agitation. More precisely, up to the constant <i>k</i>, 3/2
<i>k</i>, the kinetic energy of a molecule is the absolute temperature.
That's for a gas. If you took a solid and you say, what happens when I
heat the solid? You have a question? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: You divide by 2 because ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> is a familiar quantity, namely, kinetic energy.
That's why you divide by 2. Another thing to notice is that every gas,
whatever it's made of, at a given temperature has a given kinetic
energy because the kinetic energy per molecule on the left-hand side is
dependent on absolute temperature and nothing else. So at certain
degrees, like 300 Kelvin, hydrogen kinetic energy would be the same,
carbon kinetic energy would also be the same. The kinetic energy will
be the same, not the velocity. So, the carbon atom is heavier, it will
be moving slower at that temperature in order to have the same kinetic
energy. So, all molecules, all gases, have a given temperature. All
atoms, let me say, at a given temperature in gaseous form will have the
same kinetic energy [per molecule].</p>

<p>Now, if you have a solid--What's the difference between a gas and a
solid? In a gas, the atoms are moving anywhere they want in the box. In
a solid, every atom has a place. If you take a two-dimensional solid,
the atoms look like this. They form a lattice or an array. That's
because you will find out that, this is more advanced stuff, that every
atom finds itself in a potential that looks like this. Imagine on the
ground you make these hollows. Low points -- low potential; high points
-- high potential. Obviously, if you put a bunch of objects here they
will sit at the bottom of these little concave holes you've dug in the
ground. At zero degrees absolute all atoms will sit at the bottom of
their allotted positions; that'll be a solid at zero temperature. So in
a solid, everybody has a location.</p>

<p>I've shown you a one-dimensional solid, but you can imagine a
three-dimensional solid where in a lattice of three-dimensional points,
there's an assigned place for each atom and it sits there. If you heat
up that solid now, what happens is these guys start vibrating. Now,
here is where your knowledge of simple harmonic motions will come into
play. When you take a system in equilibrium, it will execute simple
harmonic motion if you give it a real kick. If you put it on top of a
hotplate, the atoms in the hot plate will bump into these guys and
start them moving. They will start vibrating. So, a hot solid is one in
which the atoms are making more and more violent oscillations around
their assigned positions. If you heat them more and more and more,
eventually you start doing this. You go all the way from here to here;
there is nothing to prevent it from rolling over to the next side. Once
you jump the fence, you know, think of a bunch of houses, okay? Or a
hole in the ground. You're living in a hole in the ground, as you get
agitated you're able to do more and more oscillations so you can roll
over to the next house. Once that happens all hell breaks loose because
you don't have any reason to stay where you are. You start going
everywhere. What do you think that is?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Melting.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Melting.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: That's melting. That's the
definition of melting. Melting is when you can leap over this potential
barrier, potential energy barrier, and go to the next site. The next
side is just like this side. If you can jump that fence, you can jump
this one. You go everywhere and you melt. That's the process of
melting, and once you have a liquid, atoms don't have a definite
location. Now, between a liquid and a solid, there is this clear
difference, but a liquid and a vapor is more subtle. So, I don't want
to go into that. If you look at a liquid locally, it will look very
much like a solid in the sense that inter-atomic spacing is very
tightly constrained in liquid. Whereas in a solid, if I know I am here,
I know if I go 100 times the basic lattice spacing, there'll be another
person sitting there. That's called long-range order. In a liquid, I
cannot say that. In a liquid, I can say I am here. Locally, the
environment around me is known, but if you go a few hundred miles, I
cannot tell you a precise location if some other atom will be there or
not. So, we say liquid is short-range positional order, but not
long-range order, and a gas has no order at all. If I tell you there's
a gas molecule here, I cannot tell you where anybody else is because
nobody has any assigned location.</p>

<p>Okay. So, this is the picture you should have of temperature.
Temperature is agitated motion. Either motion in the vicinity of where
you are told to sit. If you're in a solid a motion all over the box
with more and more kinetic energy. The next thing in this caricature is
that it is certainly not true that a third of the molecules are moving
back and forth. We know that's a joke, right? Now, in this room there's
no reason on earth a third of the molecules are doing this than others
are doing. That's not approximation. They're moving in random
directions. So, if you really got the stomach for it, you should do a
pressure calculation in which you assume the molecules of random
velocities sprinkled in all directions, and after all the hard work,
turns out you get exactly this answer. So, that's one thing I didn't
want to do.</p>

<p>But something I should point out to you is the following. So,
suppose I give you a gas at 300 Kelvin. You go and you take this
formula literally and you calculate from it a certain ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. If you knew the mass of the atom, say, it's
hydrogen, we know the mass of hydrogen. Then, you find the velocity and
you say okay, this man tells me that anytime I catch a hydrogen atom,
it'll have this velocity at 300 Kelvin. It may have random direction,
but he tells me that's the velocity square. Take the square root of
that, that's the velocity. It seems to us saying the unique velocity to
each temperature. Well, that's not correct. Not only are the molecules
moving in random directions, they're also moving with essentially all
possible velocities. In fact, there are many, many possible velocities
and this velocity I'm getting, in this formula, is some kind of average
velocity, or the most popular one, or the most common one. So, if you
really go to a gas and you have the ability to look into it and see for
each velocity, what's the probability that I get that velocity? The
picture I've given you is the probability of zero except at this one
magical velocity controlled by the temperature. But the real graph
looks like this. It has a certain peak. It likes to have a certain
value. If you know enough about statistics, you know there's a most
probable value, there's a median, there's a mean value. There are
different definitions. They will all vary by factors of order 1, but
the average kinetic energy will obey this condition. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: It's not really a Gaussian
because if you draw the nature of this curve, it looks like
<i>v<sup>2</sup>e</i> to the <i>-mv<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>2kT</i>.
That's the graph I'm trying to draw here. So, it looks like a Gaussian
in the vicinity of this, but it's kind of skewed. It's forced to vanish
at the origin. And it's not peaked at <i>v</i> = 0. A real Gaussian
peak at this point would be symmetric. It's not symmetric; it vanishes
here and it vanishes infinity. So, this is called a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. You don't have to remember any names but that is the
detailed property of what's happening in a gas.</p>

<p>So, a temperature does not pick a unique velocity, but it picks this
graph. If you vary your temperature, look at what you have to do. If
you change the number <i>T</i> here, if you double the value of
<i>T</i>, that means if you double the value of <i>v<sup>2</sup></i>
here and there, the graph will look the same. So, at every temperature
there is a certain shape. If you go to your temperature, it will look
more or less the same, but it may be peaked at a different velocity if
you go to a higher temperature.</p>

<p>Now, this is another thing I want to tell you. If you took a box
containing not atoms but just radiation, in other words, go inside a
pizza oven. Take out all the air, but the oven is still hot, and the
walls of the oven are radiating electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation comes in different frequencies, and you can
ask how much energy is contained in every possible frequency range. You
know, each frequency is a color so you know that. So, how much energy
is in the red and how much is in the blue? That graph also looks like
this. That's a more complicated law called the Planck distribution.
That law also has a shape completely determined by temperature. Whereas
for atoms, the shape is determined by temperature as well as the mass
of the molecules. In the case of radiation, it's determined fully by
temperature and the velocity of light. You give me a temperature, and I
will draw you another one of these roughly bell-shaped curves. As you
heat up the furnace, the shape will change. So again, a temperature for
radiation means a particular distribution of energies at each
frequency. For a gas it means a distribution of velocities. Has anybody
seen that in the news lately, you know, or heard about this?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: About this particular graph for
radiation. The probability at each frequency of finding radiation of
the frequency in a furnace of some temperature <i>T</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: No, but in current news. In the
last few years, what people did was the following. It's one of the
predictions of the Big Bang theory that the universe was formed some 14
and a half billion years ago, and in the earliest stages the
temperature of the universe was some incredibly high degrees, then as
it expanded the universe cooled, and today, at the current size, it has
got a certain average temperature, which is a remnant of the Big Bang.
And that temperature means that we are sitting in furnace of the Big
Bang. But the furnace has cooled a lot over the billions of years. The
temperature of the universe is around 3 degrees Kelvin.</p>

<p>And the way you determine that is you point your telescope in the
sky. Of course, you're going to get light from this star; you're going
to get light from that star. Ignore all the pointy things and look at
the smooth background, and it should be the same in all directions. And
plot that radiation, and now they use satellites to plot that, and
you'll get a perfect fit to this kind of furnace radiation, called
Black Body Radiation. And you read the temperature by taking that graph
and fitting it to a graph like this, but there'll be temperature. In
the case of light, this won't be velocity squared, but it will be the
frequency squared, but read off the temperature that'll make this work
and that's what gives you 3.1 or something. Near 3 degrees Kelvin. In
fact, the data point for that now if you got that in your lab then you
will be definitely busted for fudging your data because it's a perfect
fit to Black Body Radiation. One of the most perfect fits to Black Body
Radiation is the background radiation of the Big Bang. And it's
isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions, and this is one of
the predictions of the Big Bang is that that'll be the remnant of the
Black Body Radiation.</p>

<p>Again, it tells you there's a sense in which, if you go to
intergalactic space, that is your temperature. That's the temperature
you get for free. We're all living in that heat bath at 3 degrees. You
want more heat, you've got to light up your furnace but this is
everywhere in the universe, that heat left over from creation.</p>

<p>Okay. That's a very, very interesting subject. You know, a lot of
new physics is coming out by looking at just the Black Body Radiation
because the radiation that's coming to your eye left those stars long
ago. So, what you see today is not what's happening today. It's what
happened long ago when the radiation left that part of the universe.
Therefore, we can actually tell something about the universe not only
now, but at earlier periods. And that's the way in which we can
actually tell whether the universe is expanding or not expanding or is
it accelerating in its expansion, or you can even say once it was
decelerating and now it's accelerating. All that information comes by
being able to look at the radiation from the Big Bang.</p>

<p>But for you guys, I think the most interesting thing is that when
you are in thermal equilibrium, and you are living in a certain
temperature, then the radiation in your world and the molecules and
atoms in your world, will have a distribution of frequencies and
velocities given by that universal graph. Now in our class, we will
simplify life and replace this graph with a huge peak at a certain
velocity by pretending everybody's at that velocity. We will treat the
whole gas as if it was represented by single average number. So, when
someone says find the velocity of molecules, they're talking about the
average velocity. You know statistically that it's the distribution of
answers and an average answer. Because the average is what you and I
have to know. Namely, ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> is 3/2 <i>kT</i>, on
average.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, I'm going to study in detail thermodynamics. So, the
system I'm going to study is the only one we all study, which is an
ideal gas sitting inside a piston. It's got a temperature, it's got a
pressure, and it's got a volume. And I'm going to plot here pressure
and volume and I'm going to put a dot and that's my gas. The state of
my gas is summarized by where you put the dot. Every dot here is a
possible state of equilibrium for the gas. Remember, the gas, if you
look at it under the hood, is made up of 10<sup>23</sup> molecules. The
real, real state of the gas is obtained by saying, giving me
10<sup>23</sup> locations and 10<sup>23</sup> velocities. According to
Newton, that's the maximum information you can give me about the gas
right now, because with that and Newton's laws I can predict the
future. But when you study thermodynamics, you don't really want to
look into the details. You want to look at gross macroscopic properties
and there are two that you need. Pressure and volume. Now, you might
say, "What about temperature?" Why don't I have a third axis for
temperature? Why is there also not a property? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yeah. Because <i>PV = NkT</i>. I
don't have to give you <i>T</i>, if I know <i>P</i> and <i>V</i>.
There's not an independent thing you can pick. You can pick <i>P</i>
and <i>V</i> independently. You cannot pick <i>T</i>. Let me tell you,
by the way, <i>PV = NkT</i> is not a universal law. It's the law that
you apply to dilute gases. But we are going to just study only dilute
ideal gas. Ideal gas is one in which the atoms and molecules are so far
apart that they don't feel any forces between each other unless they
collide.</p>

<p>So, here is my gas. It's sitting here. Now, what I do, I had a few
weights on top of it. Three weights. I suddenly pull out one weight.
Throw it out. What do you think will happen? Well, I think this gas
will now shoot up, it'll bob up and down a few times. Then after a few
seconds, or a fraction of a second, it'll settle down with a new
location. By "settle down," I mean after a while I will not see any
macroscopic motion. Then the gas has a new pressure and a new volume.
It's gone from being there to being there. What about in between? What
happened in between the starting and finishing points? You might say
look, if it was here in the beginning it was there later, it must've
followed some path. Not really. Not in this process, because if you do
it very abruptly, suddenly throwing out one-third of the weights,
there's a period when the piston rushes up, when the gas is not in
equilibrium. By that, I mean there is no single pressure you can
associate with the gas. The bottom of the gas doesn't even know the top
is flying off. It's at the old pressure. At the top of the gas there's
a low pressure. So, different parts of the gas at different pressure,
we don't call that equilibrium. So, the dot, representing this system,
moves off the graph. It's off. It's off the radar, and only when it has
finally settled down, the entire gas can make up its mind on what its
pressure wants to be; you put it back here.</p>

<p>So, we have a little problem that we have these equilibrium states,
but when you try to go from one to another you fly off the map. So, you
want to find a device by which you can stay on the <i>PV</i> diagram as
you change the state of the gas, and that brings us to the notion of
what you call a quasi-static process. A quasi-static process is trying
to have it both ways in which you want to change the state of the gas,
and you don't want it to leave the <i>PV</i> diagram. You want it to be
always at equilibrium. So, what you really want to do is not put in
three big fat blocks like this, but instead take a gas where you have
many, many grains of sand. They can produce the pressure. Now, remove
one grain of sand. It moves a tiny bit and very quickly settles down.
It is again true during the tiny bit of settling down you didn't know
what it was doing, but you certainly nailed it at the second location.
You move one grain at a time, then you get a picture like this and you
can see where this is going. You can make the grain smaller and smaller
and smaller and in a mathematical sense you can then form a continuous
line. That is to say, you perform a process that leaves the system
arbitrarily close to equilibrium, meaning give it enough time to
readjust to the new pressure, settle down to the new volume, take
another grain and another grain. And in the spirit of calculus, you can
make these changes vanishing so that you can really then say you did
this. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Are all of these small processes reversible?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Are all of these small processes reversible?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. Such a process is also
called--you can call it quasi-static but one of the features of that,
it is reversible. You've got to be a little careful when you say
reversible. What we mean by "reversible" is, if I took off a grain of
sand and it came from here to the next dot, and I put the grain back,
it'll climb back to where it was. So, you can go back and forth on
this. But now, that's an idealized process because if you had a
friction, if you had any friction between the piston and the walls,
then if you took out a grain and it went up, you put the grain back it
might not come back to quite where it is. Because some of the
frictional losses you will never get back. You cannot put Humpty Dumpty
back. So, most of the time processes are not reversible, even if you do
them slowly, if there is friction. So, assume it's a completely
frictionless system. Because if there is friction, there is some heat
that goes out somewhere and some energy is lost somewhere and we cannot
bring it back. If we took a frictionless piston and on top of it moved
it very, very slowly, you can follow this graph. That's the kind of
thermodynamic process we're talking about.</p>

<p>In the old days, when I studied a single particular of the <i>xy</i>
plane, I just said the guy goes from here to here to there. That's very
easy to study and there's no restriction on how quickly or how fast it
moved. Particles have trajectories no matter how quickly they move. For
a thermodynamic system, you cannot move them too fast, because they are
extended and you are having a huge gas a single number called pressure,
so you cannot change one part of the gas without waiting for all of
them to communicate and readjust and achieve a global value for the new
pressure and you can move gradually. That's why it takes time to drag
along 10<sup>23</sup> particles as if they are the single number or two
numbers characterizing them. So, we'll be studying processes like
this.</p>

<p>Now, this is called a state. Two is a state and one is a state.
Every dot here, that is a state. Now, in every state of the system, I'm
going to define a new variable, which is called a quantity called
<i>U</i>, which stands for the internal energy of the gas. Internal
energy is simply the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. For solids
and liquids, there's a more complicated formula. For the gas, internal
energy is just the kinetic energy. And what is that? It is 3/2
<i>kT</i> per molecule times <i>N</i>. I'm sorry, 3/2 <i>Nk</i>, yeah.
3/2 <i>kT</i> times that. Or we can write it as 3/2 <i>nRT</i>. But
<i>nRT</i> is <i>PV</i>. You can also write it as 3/2 <i>PV</i>, so
internal energy is just 3/2 <i>PV</i>. That means at a given point on
the <i>PV</i> diagram, you have a certain internal energy. If you are
there, that's your internal energy. Take there-halves of <i>PV</i> and
that's the energy and that's literally the kinetic energy of all the
molecules in your box.</p>

<p>So, now I'm ready to write down what's called the First Law of
Thermodynamics that talks about what happens if you make a move in the
<i>PV</i> plane from one place to another place. If you go from one
place to another place, your internal energy will change from
<i>U<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>U<sub>2</sub></i>. Let's call it <i>ΔU</i>.
We want to ask what causes the internal energy of the gas to change.
So, you guys think about it now. Now that you know all about what's
happening in the cylinder, you can ask how I will change the energy?
Well, if you wanted to change the energy of a system, there are two
ways you can do it. One is you can do work on the gas. Another thing is
you can put the gas on a hotplate. If you put it on hotplate, we know
it's going to get hotter. If it gets hotter, temperature goes up. If
temperature goes up, the internal energy goes up. So, there are two
ways to change the energy of a gas.</p>

<p>The first one we call heat input. That just means put it on
something hotter and let the thing heat it up. Temperature will go up.
Notice that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on the
temperature. That's something very, very important. I mention it every
time I teach the subject and some people forget and lose a lot of
points needlessly. So, I'll say it once more with feeling. The energy
of an ideal gas depends only on the temperature. If the temperature is
not changed; energy has not changed. So, try to remember that for what
I do later.</p>

<p>So, the change of the gas, this cylinder full that I put some
weights on top and I've got gas inside, it can change either because I
did, I put in some heat, or the gas did some work. By that, I mean if
the gas expands by pushing out against the atmosphere, then it was
doing the work and <i>ΔW</i> is the work done by the gas. That's why it
comes to the minus sign, because it's the work done by the gas. If you
do work, you lose energy. So, what's the formula for work done? Let's
calculate that.</p>

<p>If I've got a piston here, it's the force times the distance. But
the force is the pressure times the area times the distance. Now, you
guys should know enough geometry to know the area of the piston times
the distance it moves is the change in the volume. So, we can write it
as <i>P</i> times <i>dV</i>. That leads to this great law. Let me write
it on a new blackboard because we're going to be playing around with
that law. This is law number one. The change in the internal energy of
a system is equal to <i>ΔQ - PΔV</i>. What does it express? It
expresses the Law of Conservation of Energy. It says the energy goes
up, either because you pushed the piston or the piston pushed you; then
you decide what the overall sign is, or you put it on a hotplate. We
are now equating putting it on a hotplate as also equivalent to giving
it energy, because we identify heat as simply energy.</p>

<p>So, if you took the piston and you nailed the piston so it cannot
move, and you put it on a hotplate, <i>PdV</i> part will vanish because
there is no <i>ΔV</i>. That's the way of heating it, it is called
<i>ΔQ</i>. Another thing you can do is thermally isolate your piston so
no heat can flow in and out of it, and then you can either have the
volume increase or decrease. If the gas expanded, <i>ΔV</i> is positive
and the <i>PΔ - PΔV</i> is negative, and the <i>ΔU</i> would be
negative; the gas will lose energy. That's because the molecules are
beating up on the piston and moving the piston. Remember, applying a
force doesn't cost you anything. But if the point of application moves,
you do work. And who's going to pay for it, the gas? It'll pay for it
through its loss of internal energy. Conversely, if you push down on
the gas, <i>ΔV</i> will be negative and this will become positive and
the energy of the gas will go up.</p>

<p>So, there are two ways to change the energy of these molecules. In
the end, all you want is you want the molecules to move faster than
before. One is to put them on a hotplate where there are fast-moving
molecules. When they collide with the slow-moving molecules, typically
the slow one's a little more faster and the fast one's a little more
slower and therefore will be a transfer of kinetic energy. Or when you
push the piston down, you can show when a molecule collides with a
moving piston. It will actually gain energy. So, that's how you do
work. That's the first law.</p>

<p>So, let us now calculate the work done in a process where a gas goes
from here to here on an isotherm. Isotherm is a graph of a given
temperature. So, this is a graph <i>P</i> times <i>V</i> equal to
constant, because <i>PV</i> = <i>nRT</i>. If <i>T</i> is constant,
<i>PV</i> is a constant, it's the rectangular hyperbola. The product of
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates is constant, so when the <i>x</i>
coordinate vanished, the <i>y</i> will go to infinity. <i>y</i>
coordinate vanishes, <i>x</i> will go to infinity. So, you want to take
your gas for a ride from here to here. Throughout it's at a certain
temperature <i>T</i>. What work is done by you? That's a very nice
interpretation. The work done by you is the integral of <i>PdV</i>. But
what is integral of <i>PdV</i>? That's <i>P</i>, and that's <i>dV</i>.
<i>Pdv</i> is that shaded region. In other words, if you just write
<i>PdV</i> it makes absolutely no sense. If you go to a mathematician
and say, "Please do the integral for me!" can the mathematician do
this? What's coming in the way of the mathematician actually doing the
integral? What do you have to know to really do an integral?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You have to know the function.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: You have to know the function.
If you just say <i>P</i>, we'll say maybe <i>P</i> is a constant, in
which case I'll pull it out of the integral. But for this problem,
because <i>PV</i> is <i>nRT</i>, and <i>T</i> is a constant, <i>P</i>
is <i>nRT</i> divided by <i>V</i>, and that's the function that you
would need to do the integral, and if you did that you will find
there's <i>nRT</i>. All of them are constants. They come out of the
integral, <i>dv</i> over <i>V</i>, and integrate from the initial
volume, the final volume. And you guys know this is a logarithm, and
the log of upper minus log of lower is the log of the ratio. And this
gives me <i>nRT</i> <i>ln (V<sub>2</sub> /V<sub>1</sub>)</i>. So, we
have done our first work calculation. When the gas goes on an
isothermal trajectory from start to finish, from volume
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> to volume <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>, the work done,
this is the work done by the gas. You can all see that gas is expanding
and that's equal to this shaded region.</p>

<p>By the way, I mention it now, I don't want to distract you, but
suppose later on I make it go backwards like this, part of the way. The
work done on the going backwards part is this area, but with a minus
sign. I hope you will understand, if you go to the right the area's
considered positive. If you go to the left, the area is considered
negative. If you do the integral and put the right limit, you'll get
the right answer. But geometrically, the area under the graph in the
<i>PV</i> diagram is the work done if you're moving the direction of
increasing volume. If you would decrease the volume, for example, if
you just went back from here, the area looks the same but the work done
is considered negative. You don't have to think very hard. If you do
the calculation going backwards, you will get a <i>ln</i> of
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. That'll automatically
be the negative of the log of <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. But geometrically, the area under the graph is
the work, if you are going to the right. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What determines the shape of the curve that links
the first state to the second state?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Oh, this one?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Mmm-hmm.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: This'll be a graph, <i>PV</i>
equal to essentially a constant. So, you take your gas, you see how
many moles there are. You know <i>R</i>, you know the temperature, you
promised not to change the temperature. So, you'll move on a trajectory
so that the product <i>PV</i> never changes. And in any <i>xy</i>
plane, if you draw a graph where the product <i>xy</i> doesn't change
it'll have this shape called a "rectangular hyperbola." It just means,
whenever one increases, the other should decrease, keeping the product
constant. That's why <i>P</i> is proportional to the reciprocal of
<i>V</i> when you do the integral.</p>

<p>Very good. So, this is now the work done by the gas. What is the
heat input? The heat input is a change in internal energy minus the
work done. Let me see. The law was <i>ΔU = ΔQ - ΔW</i>. Yeah, let's go
back to this law. In this problem, <i>ΔW</i> is what I just calculated,
<i>nRT</i>, whatever the log, <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. What is <i>ΔQ</i>? How much heat has been put
into this gas? How do I find that?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Take out the <i>T</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You take out the <i>T</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: For the heat input you mean?
Yeah, you can use <i>mc ΔT</i>, but you don't have to do anymore work.
By that, I mean you don't have to do any more cerebration. What can you
do with this equation to avoid doing further calculations? Do you know
anything else? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. This is what I told you is
the fact that people do not constantly remember, but you must. This gas
did not change its temperature. Go back to equation number whatever I
wrote down. <i>U</i> = 3/2 <i>nRT</i> or something. <i>T</i> doesn't
change, <i>U</i> doesn't change. That means the initial internal energy
and final internal energy are the same because initial temperature and
final temperature are the same. So, this guy has to be zero. That means
<i>ΔQ</i> is the same as <i>ΔW</i> in this particular case. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: When you say <i>mc ΔT</i>,
you've got to be careful of what formula you want to use. I'll tell you
why you cannot simply use <i>mc ΔT</i>. If you've got a solid and you
use <i>mc ΔT</i>, that is correct, because when you heat the solid, the
heat you put in goes into heating up the solid.</p>

<p>Maybe let's ask the following question. His question is the
following. You're telling me you put heat into a gas, right? And you
say temperature doesn't go up. How can that possibly be? I always
thought when I put heat into something, temperature goes up. That's
because you were thinking about a solid, where if you put in heat it's
got to go somewhere and, of course, temperature goes up. What do you
think is happening to the gas here? Think of the piston and weight
combination. When I want to go along this path from here to here, you
can ask yourself where is the heat input and where is the change in
energy, and why is there no change in temperature? If you take a piston
like this, if you want to increase the volume, you can certainly take
off a grain of sand, right? If you took the grain of sand and the
piston will move up, it will do work and it actually will cool down,
but that's not what you're doing. You are keeping it on a hotplate at a
certain temperature so that if it tries to cool down, heat flows from
below to above maintaining the temperature. So, what the gas is doing
in this case is taking heat energy from below and going up and working
against the atmosphere above. It takes in with one hand and gives out
to the other, without changing its energy.</p>

<p>So, when you study specific heat, which is my next topic, you've got
to be a little more careful when you talk about specific heats of
gases, and I will tell you why. There is no single thing called
specific heat for a gas. There are many, many definitions depending on
the circumstances. But I hope you understand in this case; you've got
to visualize this. It's not enough to draw diagrams and draw pictures.
What did I do to the cylinder to maintain the temperature and yet let
it expand? Expansion is going to demand work on part of the gas. That's
going to require a loss of energy unless you pump in energy from below.
So, what I've done is that I take grain after grain, so that the
pressure drops and the volume increases, but the slight expansion would
have cooled it slightly but the reservoir from below brings it back to
the temperature of the reservoir. So, you prop it up in temperature.
So, we draw the picture by saying the gas went from here to here, and
we usually draw a picture like this and say heat flowed into the system
during that process.</p>

<p>Alright, now I'll come to this question that was raised about
specific heat. Now, specific heat, you always say is <i>ΔQ</i> over
<i>ΔT</i> or <i>ΔT</i> divided by the mass of the substance. Now, it
turns out that for a gas, you've already seen that what you want to
count is not the actual mass, but the moles. Because we have seen at
the level of the ideal gas law, the energy is controlled by not simply
the mass, but by the moles. Because every molecule gets a certain
amount of energy, namely 3/2 <i>kT</i>, and you just want to count the
number of molecules, or the number of moles.</p>

<p>Now, there are many, many ways in which you can pump in heat into a
gas and heat it up and see how much heat it takes. But let's agree that
we will take one mole from now on and not one kilogram. Not one
kilogram. We'll find out if you do it that way, the answer doesn't seem
to depend on the gas. That's the first thing. Take a mole of some gas
and call the specific heat as the energy needed to raise the
temperature of one mole by one degree. So, this should not be <i>m</i>.
This should be the number of moles. If you take one mole, you can say
okay, one mole of gas I was told has energy <i>U</i> = 3/2 <i>RT</i>.
Because it was there-halves <i>nRT</i> but <i>n</i> is one mole. Now,
you want to put in some heat, and you really want the <i>ΔQ</i> over
<i>ΔT</i>, so I will remind you that <i>ΔQ</i> is <i>ΔU</i> +
<i>PΔv</i>. The heat input into a gas is the change of energy plus <i>P
Δv</i>. And that's just from the first law.</p>

<p>So, if I'm going to divide <i>ΔQ</i> <i>by ΔT</i>, there's a problem
here. Did you allow the volume to change or did you not allow the
volume to change? That's going to decide what the specific heat is. In
other words, when a solid is heated, it expands such a tiny amount, we
don't worry about the work done by the expanding solid against the
atmosphere. But for a gas, when you heat it, the volume changes so much
that the work it does against the external world is non-negligible.
Therefore, the specific heat is dependent on what you allow the volume
term to do.</p>

<p>So, there's one definition of specific heat called
<i>C<sub>V</sub></i>, and <i>C<sub>V</sub></i> is the one at constant
volume. You don't let the volume change. In other words, you take the
piston and you clamp it. Now, you pump in heat from below by putting it
on a hotplate. All the heat goes directly to internal energy. None of
that is lost in terms of expansion. So, <i>ΔV</i> is zero. In that
case, <i>ΔQ</i> over <i>ΔT</i> at constant volume, we denote that in
this fashion, at constant volume, this term is gone, and it just
becomes <i>ΔU</i> over <i>ΔT</i>. That's very easily done. <i>ΔU</i>
over <i>ΔT</i> is 3/2 <i>R</i>. So, the specific heat of a gas at
constant volume is 3 over 2<i>R</i>. When I studied solids, I never
bother about constant volume because a change in the volume of a solid
is so negligible when it's heated up, it's not worth specifying that it
was a constant volume process. But for a gas, it's going to matter
whether it was constant volume or not.</p>

<p>Then, there's a second specific heat people like to define. That's
done as follows. You take this piston. You have some gas at some
pressure. You pump in some heat but you don't clamp the piston. You let
the piston expand any way it wants at the same pressure. For example,
if it's being pushed down by the atmosphere, you let the piston move up
if it wants to, maintaining the same pressure. Well, if it moves up a
little bit, then the correct equation is the heat that you put in is
the change in internal energy plus <i>P</i> times <i>ΔV</i>, where now
<i>P</i> is some constant pressure, say the atmospheric pressure,
<i>ΔV</i> is the change in volume. So, <i>ΔQ</i> needed now will be
more, because you're pumping in heat from below and you're losing
energy above because you're letting the gas expand. Because you were
letting the pressure be controlled from the outside at some fixed
value. So now, <i>ΔQ</i>--this <i>ΔU</i> will be 3 over 2<i>RΔT</i>.
Now, what's the change in <i>P</i> times <i>ΔV</i>? Here is where you
should know your calculus. The <i>P</i> times change in <i>V</i> is the
same as the change in <i>PV</i>, if <i>P</i> is a constant. Right?
Remember long back when I did rate of change of momentum is <i>d/dt</i>
of <i>mv</i>, it's <i>m</i> times <i>dv/dt</i>, because <i>m</i>
doesn't change. You can take it inside the change. But now we use <i>PV
= RT</i>. I'm talking about one mole<i>. PV = RT</i>. That's a change
in the quantity <i>RT</i>, <i>R</i> is a constant, that's <i>R</i>
times <i>ΔT</i> so I put in here <i>R</i> times <i>ΔT</i>. This is the
<i>ΔQ</i> at constant pressure. So, the specific heat of constant
pressure is <i>ΔQ</i> over <i>ΔT</i>, keeping the pressure constant.
You divide everything by <i>ΔT</i> you get 3 over 2<i>R</i>, plus
another <i>R</i>, which is 5 over 2<i>R</i>.</p>

<p>So, the thing you have to remember, what I did in the end, is that a
gas doesn't have a single specific heat. If we just say, put in some
heat and tell me how many calories I need to raise the temperature,
that's not enough. You have to tell me whether in the interim, the gas
was fixed in its volume, or changed its volume, or obeyed some other
condition.</p>

<p>The two most popular conditions people consider are either the
volume cannot change or the pressure cannot change. If the volume
cannot change, then the change in the heat you put in goes directly to
internal energy, from the First Law of Thermodynamics. That gives you a
specific heat of 3 over 2<i>R</i>. If the pressure cannot change, you
get 5 over 2<i>R</i>. You can see <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> is bigger than
<i>C<sub>V</sub></i> because when you let the piston expand, then not
all the heat is going to heat the gas. Some of it is dissipated on top
by working against the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Then, notice that I've not told you what gas it is. That's why the
specific heat per mole is the right thing to think about because then
the answer does not depend on what particular gas you took. Whether
it's hydrogen or helium, they all have the same specific heat per mole.
They won't have the same specific heat per gram, right? Because one
gram of helium and one gram of hydrogen don't have the same number of
moles. So, you have to remember that we're talking about moles.</p>

<p>The final thing I have to caution you--very, very important. This is
for a monoatomic gas. This is for a gas whose atom is the gas itself.
It's a point. Its only energy is kinetic energy. There are diatomic
gases, by two of them [atoms] joined together, they can form a dumbbell
or something; then the energy of the dumbbell has got two parts, as you
learned long ago. It can rotate around some axis and it can also move
in space. Then the internal energy has also got two parts. Energy due
to motion of the center of mass and energy due to rotation. Some
molecules also vibrate. So, there are lots of complicated things, but
if you got only one guy, or one atom, whatever its mass is, it cannot
rotate around itself and it cannot vibrate around itself, so those
energies all disappear.</p>

<p>So, we have taken the simplest one of a monoatomic gas, a gas whose
fundamental entity is a single atom rather than a complicated molecule.
And that's all you're responsible for. I'll just say one thing.
<i>C<sub>P</sub></i> over <i>C<sub>V</sub></i>, I want to mention it
before you run off to do your homework. I don't know if it comes up.
It's called <i>γ</i>, that's five-third for a monoatomic gas. You can
just take the ratio of the numbers. If in some problem you find
<i>γ</i> is not five-thirds, do not panic. It just means it's a gas
which is not monoatomic. If it's not monoatomic, these numbers don't
have exactly those values. We don't have to go beyond that. You just
have to know there's a ratio <i>γ</i>, which is five-thirds in the
simplest case, but in some problem, somewhere in your life, you can get
a <i>γ</i> which is not five-thirds. Remember this problem set is due
next Wednesday. But I would ask you to start attacking whatever you
can, as and when I lecture.</p>
