<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Stable equilibrium, and if you
disturb them, they rock back and forth and there are two simple
examples. The standard textbook example is this mass on spring. This
spring has a certain natural length, which I'm showing you here. It
likes to sit there. But if you pull it so the mass comes here, you move
it from <i>x</i> = 0 to a new location <i>x</i>; then, there is a
restoring force <i>F</i>, which is -<i>kx</i>, and that force will be
equal to mass times acceleration by Newton's law, and so you're trying
to solve the equation <i>d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -k/m</i> times
<i>x</i>, and we use the symbol, <i>ω<sup>2</sup> = k/m</i>, or
<i>ω</i> square root of <i>k</i>/<i>m</i>. And what's the solution to
this equation? I think we did a lot of talking and said look, we are
looking for a function which, when differentiated twice, looks like the
same function up to some constants, and we know they are trigonometry
functions. Then, we finally found the answer. The most general answer
looks like <i>A cos ωt - φ</i>. A is the amplitude, <i>φ</i> is called
the phase. That tells you what your clock is doing when <i>x</i> is a
maximum, and we can always choose <i>φ</i> to be 0. That means when the
time is 0, <i>x</i> will have the biggest value <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>This is an example of simple harmonic motion. But it is a very
generic situation, so I'll give you a second example. Now, we don't
have a mass but we have a bar, let's say, suspended by a cable, hanging
from the ceiling, and it's happy the way it is. But if you come and
twist it by angle <i>θ</i>, give it a little twist, then it will try to
untwist itself. So, now we don't have a restoring force but we have a
restoring torque. What can be the expression for the restoring torque?
When you don't do anything, it doesn't do anything, so it's a function
of <i>θ</i> that vanishes when <i>θ</i> is 0. If <i>θ</i> is not 0,
it'll begin as some function of <i>θ</i>, but the leading term would be
just <i>θ</i>. But now, you can put a constant here. It'll still be
proportional to <i>θ</i>, and you put a minus sign for the same reason
you put a minus sign here to tell you it's a restoring torque. That
means if you make <i>θ</i> positive, the torque will try to twist you
the other way. If you make <i>θ</i> negative it'll try to bring you
back. So, you have to find this <i>κ</i>. If you find this <i>κ</i>
then you can say <i>-κ</i> times <i>θ</i> is <i>I</i> times
<i>d<sup>2</sup>θ</i> over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>. Mathematically, that
equation's identical to that, and <i>θ</i> then will look like some
constant. You can call it A <i>cos (ωt- φ</i>, and <i>ω</i> [squared]
now will be the ratio of this <i>κ</i> at the moment of inertia,
because mathematically that's the role played by <i>κ</i> and <i>I</i>.
They are like <i>k</i> and <i>m</i>.</p>

<p>Now, if someone tells you this is <i>κ</i>, then you are done. You
just stick it in and mindlessly calculate all the formulas. You can
find <i>θ</i>, you can derivatives and so on. Sometimes, they may not
tell you what <i>κ</i> is. In the case of a spring, they would have to
give you <i>k</i> or they may tell you indirectly if I pull this spring
by 9 inches, I exert a certain force, they're giving you <i>F</i> and
they're giving you <i>x</i> and you can find <i>k</i>. But in rotation
problems, the typical situation is the following.</p>

<p>Let us take the easiest problem of a pendulum. The pendulum is
hanging, say a massless rod, with some mass <i>m</i> at the bottom. So,
it's very happy to stay this way. If you leave it like this, it would
stay this way forever. No torque, no motion. Now, you come along and
you disturb that by turning it by an angle <i>θ</i>. If you do, then
the force is like this, the separation vector <i>r</i> from the pivot
point is this, and <i>r</i> cross <i>F</i> will be non-zero because the
angle between them is not 0, and you remember that torque is equal to
<i>rF sin θ</i>, and I told you for small angles, this can be <i>rF
θ</i>, and <i>r</i> happens to be, in this problem, the length of the
pendulum, so it's really -<i>mgl θ</i>.</p>

<p>So, you have to do some work to find <i>θ</i> [correction: should
have said <i>κ</i>]. It wasn't just given to you on a plate. You did
this piece of thinking, and namely, you disturbed the system from
equilibrium and found the restoring torque. Then, you stared at the
formula and say hey, this guy must be the <i>κ</i> I'm looking for
because that number times <i>θ</i> is the restoring torque. Then the
<i>ω</i> here will be--this <i>κ</i> is a generic <i>κ</i> that goes
into whatever it is for that problem. For our problem, <i>κ</i> happens
to be <i>mgl</i>. That's something you should understand. It's not a
universal number that's known to everybody like the spring constant of
anything. In the case of mass and this pendulum, it depends on how long
the pendulum is, how big the mass is, but you can work it out and
extract <i>κ</i>. Downstairs, you need the momentum of inertia for a
point mass <i>m</i> at a distance <i>l</i> from the point of rotation,
which is <i>ml<sup>2</sup></i>. So, you can cancel the <i>l</i>, you
can cancel the <i>m</i>, and you get <i>ω</i> is root of <i>g</i> over
<i>l</i>. Let me remind you guys that <i>ω</i> is connected to what you
and I would call the frequency by this 2<i>π</i>, or what you and I
would call the time period by 2<i>π</i> over <i>T</i>.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is the situation. Let me give one other example. This
is a homework problem, but I want to give you a hint on how to do this.
Don't take a pendulum with all the mass concentrated there. Take some
irregularly shaped object, a flat planar object. You drive a nail
through it there, hang it on the wall. It'll come to rest in a certain
configuration and you should think about where will the center of mass
be if I hang it like this on the wall? Center of mass is somewhere in
the body here. So, I want you to think about it. I'll tell you in a
second. The center of mass, they claim, will lie somewhere on this
vertical line going through that point. I know that by default because
if the center of mass is here, for example, we know all the force of
gravity can be imagined to be acting here [pointing to drawing]. Then
if you do that separation and do the torque, then you will find this is
able to exert a torque on this point, but that cannot be in
equilibrium. So, center of mass will align itself. The body would swing
a little bit and settle down; the center of mass somewhere there.</p>

<p>If you now disturb the body, I don't want to draw another picture,
but I'll probably fail. This is the rotated body, off from its ideal
position, then there will be a torque. What will the torque be? It'll
be the same thing minus <i>mgl sin θ</i>, which I'm going to replace by
<i>θ</i>. <i>l</i> is now the distance between the pivot point and the
center of mass. That's your torque. So, you can read the <i>κ</i>. In
fact, it's just like the pendulum. In other words, as far as the torque
is concerned, it's as if all the mass were sitting here. The difference
will be in a moment of inertia. Moment of inertia of this is not
<i>ml<sup>2</sup></i>, so don't make the mistake. All the mass is not
sitting here. All the mass is sitting all over the place. So, you
should know that if you want the moment of inertia, it is <i>I</i> with
respect to center of mass plus this <i>ml<sup>2</sup></i>. That's the
old parallel axis theorem. So, take that moment of inertia and put that
into this formula here; take this <i>κ</i> and put it there, you'll get
some frequency. That's the frequency with which it will oscillate. So,
every problem that you will ever get will look like one of these two.
Either there is something moving linearly with a coordinate that you
can call <i>x</i>, or it's rotating or twisting by an angle you can
call <i>θ</i>. And if you want to find out the frequency of vibration,
you have to disturb it from equilibrium, either by pulling the mass or
by twisting the cable or displacing this pendulum from its ideal
position here, then finding the restoring torque. Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What can we say [inaudible] its restoring torque in
the twisting example? How do we describe that?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's a very good point. His
question is, if I gave you a cable and I twist the cable by some angle,
how are we going to calculate restoring torque? Here is the good news.
This problem is so hard we'll give it to you. In other words, there is,
of course, an underlying answer. Given a cable, made of some material
and its torsional properties, how much of a torque you'll get if you
twist it by some amount, but it's not something you can calculate from
first principle, so they'll simply have to give it to you, okay, in
such problems. The only time you'll have to find the torque on your own
is in a problem like this where I believe you know enough to figure out
the torque.</p>

<p>Okay, what you will find is, if you leave it alone, it'll go to a
position where there is no torque. If you move it off the position,
there will be a torque, and the torque will always be proportional to
the angle by which you've displaced it. You read off the
proportionality constant and that's your <i>κ</i>. You should look at
the forces too. It is pretty interesting. This body, when it is hanging
in its rest position, has two forces on it. The nail, which is pushing
up and the weight of the body which is pushing down, and they cancel
each other. The nail will keep it from falling. The nail will not keep
it from swinging, because the force of the nail acting as it does at
the pivot point is unable to exert a torque, whereas the minute you
rotate the body, <i>mg</i> is able to exert a torque. That's why if you
twist it, it'll start rattling back and forth.</p>

<p>Alright. So, what I'm going to do now is to go over more complicated
oscillations using some of the techniques we learned last time. So,
here is the mega formula. I'm going to give it to you guys. You're
allowed to tattoo it on your face. You can carry it with you. I will
allow you to bring it but you cannot forget this formula. I think you
know the formula I'm driving at. Ready? <i>e</i> to the <i>ix</i>, or
<i>θ</i>, I don't care. Let me call it <i>θ</i> here, is <i>cos θ + I
sin θ</i>. That's a great formula from Euler. From this formula, if you
take the complex conjugate of both sides, that means change every
<i>i</i> to minus <i>i</i>, you will get <i>e</i> to the minus
<i>iθ</i> is <i>cos θ - i sin θ</i>. That also you should know. If you
got this in your head--By the way, this is something you're not going
to derive on the spot. It takes a lot of work. If you tell me what are
the few things you really have to cram, that you don't want to carry in
your head, well, this is one of them. Okay, this is a formula worth
memorizing, unlike formula No. 92 of your text. It's not worth
memorizing. This is worth memorizing. Once you got this, you should
realize that in any expression involving complex numbers, you can get
another equation where every <i>i</i> is changed to minus <i>i</i>.
That'll give you this one. That's called complex conjugation. I
generally said, if you have a complex number <i>z</i>, <i>z</i> star is
equal to <i>x</i> - <i>iy</i>, if <i>z</i> is equal to <i>x</i> plus
<i>Iy</i>. So, in our simple example, this fellow here is <i>z</i>.
This is the <i>x</i> and this is the <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to invert this formula. To invert the
formula, you add the 2 and divide by 2. Then, you will find <i>cos
θ</i> is <i>e<sup>iθ</sup></i> + <i>e<sup>-iθ</sup></i> over 2. If you
subtract and divide by 2<i>i</i>, you will find <i>sin θ</i> is
<i>e<sup>iθ</sup></i> - <i>e<sup>iθ</sup></i> over 2<i>i</i>. In other
words, my claim is that this funny exponential, sum of exponential, is
the family of cosine. It'll do everything your cosine will do. It'll
oscillate, sine squared plus cosine squared would be 1, it'll obey all
trigonometric identities, like sine 2 <i>θ</i> is 2 <i>sin θ cos</i>
<i>θ</i>, everything comes out of this expression.</p>

<p>So, you should know, here is the main point you should learn. We
don't need trigonometric functions anymore. Once you got the
exponential function, provided you let the exponent be complex or
imaginary you don't need trigonometric functions. This is one example
of grand unification. People always say Maxwell unified this, and
Einstein tried to unify this. Unification means things that you thought
were unrelated are, in fact, related, and there are different
manifestations of the same thing. When we first discovered
trigonometric functions, we were drawing right-angle triangles and
opposite side and adjacent side. Then, we discovered the exponential
function which, by the way, was computed by bankers who were trying to
calculate compound interest every second. The fact that those functions
are related is a marvelous result, but it happens only if you got
complex numbers. So, this is another thing you should know.</p>

<p>Okay, now, armed with this we are ready to do anything we want. Let
me just tell you that every complex number <i>z</i> can be written as
its absolute value times some phase. In other words, if my complex
number <i>z</i> is here, it is <i>x</i> + <i>iy</i>; that's one way to
write it. You can also write it as its absolute value. It'll be
<i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i> <i>φr</i>, <i>re</i> to the <i>iφ</i>.
<i>r</i> is the radial length which also happens to be the length of
the complex number. That's called the polar form of the complex number.
<i>x + iy</i> is the Cartesian form of the complex number. I may have
called them <i>r</i> and <i>θ</i>, <i>r</i> and <i>φ</i>. I just don't
remember. I'm going to use these symbols back and forth because people
do use both the symbols, which is why I'm sometimes calling this angle
as <i>θ</i> and sometimes this angle as <i>φ</i>, but the basic idea is
the same. This entity here can do it either in this form or in this
form. This is something you should know. If you don't know, or you
don't understand, you should stop and ask. Everything is built on
this.</p>

<p>So, what I'm going to do now is to go back to this rather simple
equation, <i>d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> = -ω<sup>2</sup>x</i>. By
the way, today I'm going to call this <i>ω</i> as <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>.
It's the same guy. I'm going to call it <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> because we
will find as the hour progresses, there are going to be many <i>ω</i>s
in the game. Two more <i>ω</i>s are going to come in. So, we've got to
be able to tell them apart. As long as there's only one <i>ω</i> in
town, you just call it <i>ω</i>. If there are many, you call this
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> to mean it's the frequency of vibration of the
system left to its own design, and you pull it and let it go. What's
the frequency? An angular frequency, that's what we call
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, how did we solve this equation? The way I tried to solve it for
you is to say, turn it into a word problem. I'm looking for a function,
<i>x(t)</i> with a property that two derivatives of the function look
like the function, and we rake our brains [inaudible] and we
remembered, hey, sines and cosines are the property. One derivative is
no good. Turn sign into cosine. Two derivatives bring back the function
you started with, which is why the answer could be sines or cosines.
But now I'm going to solve with a different way. My thinking is going
to be: I know a function that repeats itself, even when it
differentiated once. Namely, the function has a property; its first
derivative looks like the function itself. It's obvious that his
90-second derivative will also look like the function because taking
the derivative leaves the function alone, except for pulling out some
numbers. So, why not say, "I want an answer that looks like this:
<i>x</i> equals some <i>A</i> to the <i>αt</i>." That certainly has a
property that if you take two derivatives it's going to look like
<i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i> on the left-hand side, and <i>e</i> to the
<i>αt</i> on the right-hand side, and then you can cancel them and
you've got yourself a solution. Do you guys remember why I didn't
follow this solution for the oscillator? Why was it rejected? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Ah. That's a very good point.
So, maybe I will take <i>e</i> to the minus <i>αt</i>. How about that?
Will that give me a second derivative which is negative? You didn't
fall for that, right? Because the first time you'll get <i>-α</i> but
second time you'll get +<i>α<sup>2</sup></i>. That's correct. So, this
function is no good. Also, it doesn't look like what I want. Even
without doing much mathematical physics, I know if you pull this spring
it's going to go back and forth, whereas these functions are
exponentially growing; they're exponentially falling, they just don't
do the trick. But now, we'll find that if you're willing to work with
complex exponentials, this will do the job.</p>

<p>So, we're just going to take this guess and put it in the equation
and see if I can get an answer that works, okay? This is called an
<i>ansatz</i>. <i>Ansatz</i> are something we use all the time. It's a
German word. I'm not sure exactly what it means, but we all use it to
mean a tentative guess. That's what it is. If you're lucky, it'll work.
If you're not lucky, that's fine. You move on and try another solution.
So, we're going to say, "Can a solution of this form be found, with
<i>A</i> and <i>α</i> completely free?" Maybe the equation will tell me
what <i>A</i> and <i>α</i> should be. So, let's take it, put it here.
By the way, I'm going to write this equation in a form that's a little
easier. <i>x</i> double dot is minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x</i>
but each dot is a derivative. It's just more compact that way rather
than to write all of this stuff.</p>

<p>So, let's take that guess and put it here and see what we get. I
get, when I take two derivatives, you can say, "Do I want <i>e</i> to
the <i>αt</i> or <i>e</i> to the -<i>αt</i>," you'll find it doesn't
matter so I'm going to take <i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i> and put it in.
Now, the beauty of the <i>x</i> function now is to take one derivative,
<i>x</i> dot. I hope everybody knows the <i>x</i> dot of this is,
<i>A</i> [<i>α</i>] <i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i>, and <i>x</i> double dot
is another <i>α</i>. <i>Aα<sup>2</sup>e</i> to the <i>αt</i>. That's
the beauty of the exponential. The act of differentiation is trivial.
You just multiply it by the exponent, <i>α</i>. See, this being the
result of taking two derivatives, let me write it here now. What do I
get? So, I'm going to go to <i>x</i> double dot equal to minus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> squared <i>x</i>. Into that, I'm going to put in
the guess, <i>x</i> equals <i>Ae</i> to the <i>αt</i>, and what do I
find?</p>

<p>In fact, let me write the equation in a nicer way: <i>x</i> double
dot plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> squared <i>x</i> has to vanish. I just
brought everything to one side. Now, put <i>e<sup>αt</sup></i>,
<i>A</i> to the <i>αt</i> as your guess, then you find that
<i>α<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>Ae<sup>α</sup>t</i>, plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>
squared <i>Ae<sup>αt</sup></i> has to be 0. So, we know what to do.
Let's group a few terms. So, this means I get <i>A</i> times
<i>α<sup>2</sup></i> + 1, <i>e<sup>αt</sup></i> has to vanish. If you
can make that happen, you got a solution because you've satisfied the
equation. No one's going to say, well, you got it by guesswork. Well,
it turns out solving differential equation is only guesswork. There's
no other way to solve the equation other than to make a guess, stick it
in, fiddle with the parameters, see if it will work. So, we're not done
yet because we want this to vanish. How many ways are there to kill
this answer? You can say maybe <i>A</i> is 0. <i>A</i> is 0; you've got
what you call a trivial solution. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Ah, yes. Thank you. Yep. Thank
you very much. So, this one is α<sup>2</sup> +
ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>. Does everybody follow that? Yes, from here
to here it's very clear what to do. So, we cannot kill <i>A</i>.
Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to
rule out certain options I don't like. The option I don't like to get
this to be 0 is to say that is 0. That's not happening.
<i>e<sup>α</sup>t</i> is not going to vanish. Maybe it'll vanish for
some negative infinity time, but I want this to be true at all times.
The equation has to be obeyed at all times, so this guy certainly is
not zero at all times, so the only way to fix that is to have
<i>α<sup>2</sup> + ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> = 0. That's the only
solution, which is not a trivial solution. Well, that's a simple
equation, right? It's a quadratic equation that means α<sup>2</sup> =
ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>, or <i>α</i> is plus or minus
<i>iω<sub>0</sub></i>. So, when we were young and we didn't know about
complex numbers, we would come to this stage and we would quit and say,
"Look, exponentials won't work, but now we are not afraid of complex
exponentials, so we embrace the solution." So now, I've got two
solutions.</p>

<p>By the way, what's the value of <i>A</i>? Think about this. If this
condition is satisfied, you realize <i>A</i> can be whatever you like.
<i>A</i> is completely arbitrary. So, what this equation has told me is
the following. Yes, there are solutions of this form. For <i>A</i> you
can pick any number you like, in fact, real or complex, it doesn't
matter. The equation is satisfied. But your <i>α</i> is not an
arbitrary number. It can be only one of two numbers:
<i>+iω<sub>0</sub></i> or <i>-iω<sub>0</sub></i>. So, we've got a
problem now that I look at one answer, I got two. So, I will write them
both. So, let's say that the solution <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> of <i>t</i>,
which is some number <i>A</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iω<sub>0</sub>t</i>,
then I got another solution <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> of <i>t</i>, which is
equal to any other number <i>B</i>, <i>e</i> to the
-<i>iω<sub>0</sub>t</i>. Now, I think you guys can see in your head
that if you take this and you put it in the equation, it works, and if
you take this and put it in the equation, that also works. Because when
you take two derivatives, <i>iω</i> whole square would be minus
<i>ω</i> square, minus <i>iω<sub>0</sub></i> whole square would also be
minus <i>ω</i> not square, so both would work.</p>

<p>Now, we have to ask, "How do I decide between that solution and that
solution?" It turns out that we don't have to pick. We can pick both,
and I'll tell you what I mean by "we can pick both." Now, this is a
very, very important property for all of you who are going into
economics or engineering or chemistry. This or other disciplines, which
are mathematical, the property I'm going to mention of this equation is
very important, so please pay attention.</p>

<p>This is called a linear equation. A linear equation will obey a
certain property called superposition. I'll have to tell you what it
is. If I give you differential equation, you know, 96 derivative of
<i>x</i>, plus 52 times the 37 derivative of <i>x</i>, blah blah blah
adds up to 0; what makes it a linear equation is that throughout the
equation, either you find the function <i>x</i> or its derivatives, but
never the squares of cubes at higher powers of <i>x</i> or the
derivatives. Okay? The function appears to first power, not to second
power. For example, if this were the equation you were trying to solve,
that is not a linear equation. That's called a non-linear equation. If
you have a linear equation, there's a very, very profound consequence
and I'm going to tell you what it is, and that lies at the heart of so
many things we do.</p>

<p>So, let me write down two solutions. One of them will be
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> double dot <i>+ ω<sub>0</sub>
<sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub></i> = 0. Second one obeys
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> double dot <i>+
ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>x<sub>2</sub></i> = 0. Don't even have to look
at these two solutions. Take a general problem where you have a linear
equation that are two solutions. Add the two equations. On the
left-hand side, I get a second derivative of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> plus
a second derivative of <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, and remember that is, in
fact, the second derivative. Now, I go back to the old notation of
<i>x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub></i>. This has to do with the fact the
derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, and the sum of the
derivative is the derivative of the sum. Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So, because you have these two linear solutions,
does that mean you can generate an infinite number of [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Yes. I'm coming to that in a
minute. I'm first doing a more modest goal of showing that their sum is
also a solution. In the second term, I get <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> squared
times <i>x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub></i> = 0. You stare at this
equation. Look, this plus this implies what I've written down simply by
adding. But say in words what you found out. What you found out, is
that if <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> satisfies the equation,
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> satisfies the equation <i>x<sub>1</sub> +
x<sub>2</sub></i>, let's call it <i>x</i> plus, is <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>
+ <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> also satisfies the equation, and the proof is
right in front of you. And the key was the derivative of a sum is the
sum of the derivatives. Now, I'm going to generalize it more and say,
suppose I multiplied all of the first equation by <i>A</i>, and all of
the second equation by <i>B</i>. Well, that's certainly still true,
right? You take something equal to 0, multiply both sides by A, it's
still going to be 0. Now, imagine adding this to this [adding the two
equations together]. Add this to this, and what do you get? You will
find <i>d<sup>2</sup>/dt<sup>2</sup></i> of <i>Ax<sub>1</sub></i> +
<i>Bx<sub>2</sub></i> + <i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>,
<i>Ax</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>Bx<sub>2</sub></i> is 0.</p>

<p>So, here is the punch line. If you give me two solutions to this
equation, I can manufacture another one by taking the first one times
any number I like, plus the second one times any other number I like.
So, the story is a lot more complicated than it looked. It looked like
there are two solutions; actually, there's infinite number of solutions
because you can pick <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> any way you like. So, linear
equations typically have infinite number of solutions and you build
them up by taking a few building blocks. They're like unit vectors
<i>I</i> and <i>J</i>. You can take any multiple of this unit, vector
any multiple of that unit vector, and this combination will also solve
the equation.</p>

<p>Just so you don't think this is going to happen all the time, let me
remind you. You don't have to write this down but you guys follow what
I'm saying. Suppose this quantity here was not <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> but
the square of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and here. Okay. You don't have to
write this because this is not a linear equation. We're not interested
in this. But notice this is non-linear, and you guys should be able to
pick it up. It's non-linear because I've got the square of the unknown.
Now, can you see if I add these two equations, forget <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, let them both be 1. I get <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> squared plus
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> squared, but that does not equal to
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, the whole thing square.
So, even though the second derivative of the sum is the sum of the
second derivative, the sum of the squares is not the square of the sum.
So, for a non-linear equation you cannot add solutions, but for linear
equations you can combine solutions with arbitrary coefficients. That's
the lesson you have learned today.</p>

<p>So, harmonic oscillating equation is a linear equation, so feel free
to combine them and get the following solution: x(t) is equal to
Ae<sup>iω0</sup> , plus B e<sup>-iω0t</sup>. A and B are whatever you
like, but <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> is the original root of <i>k/m</i>. But
if I gave you this solution, will you be happy to take it as a solution
for the mass spring system, and if not, what is it you don't like? Yes?
Anybody have a view? I mean, would you take that as a good solution?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Wouldn't you need to figure out how to choose the
right <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> In order to achieve what?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Because your system starts at some amplitude
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, he's raising a point. Let
me repeat his point. <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in general--they are
arbitrary. For this mass and this spring you can pick any <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> you like. But on a given day, when you pull it by 9
centimeters and release it, the answer has to be chosen so that our
<i>t</i> = 0, <i>x</i> becomes 9, and the velocity, let's say, was 0
when you released it, so when you take the derivative of this, the
velocity should vanish at <i>t</i> = 0. Or maybe it will have some
other velocity. But you can fit initial coordinate, initial velocity,
the two numbers, by picking these two numbers. You understand that. But
that's not enough. I've got another problem. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It has imaginary numbers in it?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. That should bother you. The
answer is manifestly not real, okay, and we know <i>x</i> is the real
function. That is not a mathematical requirement of the equation, but a
physical requirement that when you pull a mass by 9 centimeters and you
release it, it's going to oscillate with some real <i>x</i> and not a
complex <i>x</i>, so you've got to fix that. So, to say that <i>x</i>
is real really means the following. You remember that in a
complex--world of complex numbers, a complex number <i>x + iy</i> has a
complex conjugate <i>x - iy</i> and the property of real numbers, is
that when you take the complex conjugate, nothing happens because
<i>i</i> goes to minus <i>i</i>. If the number was purely real, it
satisfies the condition <i>z</i> = <i>z</i> star. So, real numbers are
their own complex conjugates. In general, a complex number is not its
own conjugate, but if you wanted me to draw you a picture, that's where
the <i>z</i> is, and that's where the <i>z</i> star is, but fellows on
the <i>x</i> axis have the properties, <i>z</i> is the same as <i>z</i>
star. <i>z</i> star is a reflection of the <i>x</i> axis of <i>z</i>,
and therefore, if the number is real, it's its own reflection.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to demand that this solution, in addition to
satisfying the basic equation, also is real. To do that, I'm going to
find the complex conjugate. It's denoted by the <i>x</i> star of
<i>t</i>. I want to conjugate everything in sight. The complex
conjugate of <i>A</i> I'm going to call <i>A</i> star. Complex
conjugate of e<sup>iωt</sup> is e<sup>-iω0t</sup>. Why? Because the
<i>i</i> goes to minus <i>i</i>, <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>t</i> are
real numbers. Nothing happens to them. And <i>B</i> becomes <i>B</i>
star and this becomes <i>e</i> to the plus <i>iω<sub>0</sub>t</i>. And
I demand that these two fellows are equal. If they are both equal, then
I take this exponential and demand that those be the same. That means I
demand that <i>A</i> be the same as <i>B</i> star, because if <i>A</i>
is the same as <i>B</i> star, this will go into this, and then I will
demand that <i>B</i> is the same as <i>A</i> star. If these conditions
are satisfied, <i>x</i> star will become <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>So, the trick is to take the function, take its complex conjugate,
equate it to itself, and look at the consequence. Now, I want to tell
you that if <i>A = B</i> star, then you don't have to worry about this
as an extra condition, because I'm your complex conjugate, you are my
complex conjugate, but the way it works is if you took <i>A</i> and
changed every <i>i</i> to minus <i>i</i>, right, or if you took
<i>B</i>, whatever its complex form was, change <i>i</i> to minus
<i>i</i> you get <i>A</i>. But if you do it one more time, you come
back to where you are. In other words, for any complex number, if you
star it and you star it one more time, you come back to where you are.
Therefore, if <i>A = B</i> star, take the complex conjugate of the
left-hand side, you'll find <i>A</i> star is equal to <i>B</i> star
star which is <i>B</i>. So, you don't need these two conditions. You do
need <i>A</i> = <i>B</i> star.</p>

<p>Okay, so you have to put that extra condition now. So, in the real
world, for people who want a real answer, you want to write it as
<i>Ae<sup>iω0t</sup></i> + <i>A</i> star <i>e<sup>-iωt</sup></i>. In
other words, <i>B</i> is not an independent number. <i>B</i> has to be
the complex conjugate of <i>A</i>. Then, all of you can see at a glance
that this is now real, because whatever this animal is, this is the
complex conjugate of that, which got all the <i>i</i>s turned into
minus <i>i</i>. When you add them, all the <i>i</i>s will cancel;
answer will be real. But <i>A</i> is not necessarily real. The complex
number <i>A</i>, which is some complex number, has a length and it can
have a phase, because every complex number can be written in this form.
So, if you remember that, then you find x looks like absolute value of
A<i>e<sup>iω0t</sup></i> p+ <i>φ</i> plus absolute value of
A<i>e<sup>-iωt</sup></i> + <i>φ</i>. Well, maybe that's too fast for
you, so let me repeat what I did. In the place of <i>A</i>, write the
absolute value times <i>e<sup>iφ</sup></i>. <i>e<sup>iφ</sup></i> will
combine it <i>e<sup>iωt</sup></i> and form this exponential. Second
term will be just a conjugate of the whole thing. You don't even have
to think. Now, what is this function I have? I want you to think about
it. Do you recognize this creature here as something familiar? Yes? Do
you have any idea? Yeah? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Without the <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You remember this great
identity. Where is it? Here? This one. e<sup>iθ</sup> +
<i>e<sup>-iθ</sup></i> is 2 times <i>cos θ</i>. So, this becomes 2
times absolute value of <i>A cos ωt + φ</i>, and if you want you can
call 2 <i>A</i> as another number <i>C cos ω<sub>0</sub>t + φ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Oh, but for any complex number.
You can pull certainly this number out of both. You pull it out and you
got <i>e</i> to the <i>i</i> something plus either the minus <i>i</i>
something--</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> So, this is a long and difficult
way to get back to the old answer. You got this by filling it out and
guessing and arguing physically. But I want to show you that with an
exponential function, you would have come to this answer anyway. So,
your point of view is, you know, we don't need this. We've got enough
problems in life; we're doing well with cosines, thank you. Why do you
bring this exponential on us? Well, now I'm going to give you a problem
where you cannot talk your way out of this by just turning it into a
word problem. The word problem I meant, we asked a word question, find
me a function where the second derivative looks like itself, and you
can either start at exponentials and differentiate twice, or sines and
cosines. So, you don't need exponentials.</p>

<p>But look at the following problem. This is a problem of a mass
<i>m</i>, force constant <i>k</i>, moving on a surface with friction.
The minute you got friction, you have an extra force. So you find
<i>m</i>, <i>x</i> double dot equal to minus <i>kx</i>, which would be
all the force due to the spring. Friction also exerts a force which has
got some coefficient <i>b</i>, but it's multiplied by the velocity. We
know that if you're moving to the right, the force of the left you are
moving to the left the force is to the right, frictional force is
velocity dependent. So, the equation you want to solve, when you've got
friction, is really <i>mx</i> double dot plus <i>bx</i> dot plus
<i>kx</i> equal to 0. I'm going to divide everything by <i>m</i>. Take
the <i>m</i>, put it here, and put it here. Then, I'm going to rewrite
for us the equation we want to solve with friction. <i>x</i> double
dot, plus <i>γx</i> dot, plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> squared <i>x</i> =
0, where <i>γ</i> is just b over <i>x</i>. So, this is the equation you
want to solve.</p>

<p>Can you solve this by your usual word problem? It's going to be
difficult, because you want a function which, when I take two
derivatives, it looks like the function plus some amount of its own
derivative. If you take <i>cos ωt</i>, it won't do it. If you take
<i>sin ωt</i>, it won't do it.</p>

<p>So, we can still solve it because even this equation, you solve by
the same mindless approach, which is to say, let <i>x</i> look like
<i>A</i>, <i>Ae</i> to the <i>αt</i>, and it'll work. Let's see how
it'll work. It has to work. You can see why because when I take two
derivatives of <i>x</i>, I'll get <i>α<sup>2</sup></i>. Let me pull the
<i>A</i> out of everything plus <i>αγ</i> plus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>αt</i> = 0.</p>

<p>So, what we learn is yes, there are solutions of this form to this
equation. Once again, <i>A</i> can be whatever number you like, because
if <i>A</i> vanishes you've killed the whole solution. <i>e</i> to the
<i>αt</i> is not going to vanish at every instant in time, so the only
way is for this to vanish. That means <i>α</i> that you put into this
guess is not any old number, but the solution to this quadratic
equation, <i>α<sup>2</sup> + αγ + ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> = 0.
So, we want <i>α<sup>2</sup> + αγ</i> not square is
<i>ω<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> = 0. So, <i>α</i> must be the root of
this equation, and we all know a quadratic equation will have two
roots, and we will get two solutions, and we can add them with any
coefficient we like. That'll also be a solution.</p>

<p>So, let me write it down. So, in other words, I'm going to
explicitly solve this quadratic equation. So, go back to the old days
and remember that the solution of that equation will be <i>α</i> =
<i>-γ</i>, plus or minus square root of <i>γ<sup>2</sup></i> -
4<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square over 2. I would like to rewrite this as
minus <i>γ</i> over 2, plus or minus square root of <i>γ</i> over 2
square, minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square. And let's call the two
roots, one with a plus sign and one with a minus sign, as <i>α</i> plus
and minus. This is a shorthand for this whole combination.</p>

<p>You understand that if I give you the mass and the spring constant,
and I give you the coefficient of friction, the number <i>b</i>,
<i>α</i> plus and <i>α</i> minus are uniquely known, so you'll get two
precise numbers coming out of this whole game, and your answer then to
this problem will be <i>x</i> of <i>t</i> is any number <i>A</i> times
<i>e</i> to the minus <i>α</i> plus <i>t</i> with any number <i>B</i>
times <i>e</i> to the minus <i>α</i> minus <i>t</i>, where <i>α</i>
plus or minus are these two numbers. I want you to notice both numbers
are falling exponentials. Very important, because now I'm talking about
a mass where I pull the spring, there's a lot of friction, and I let it
go, I don't want an exponentially growing answer. That makes no sense.
The <i>x</i> should eventually vanish and that will, in fact,
happen.</p>

<p>Let's make sure you understand that. Look at these two roots. Minus
<i>γ</i> over 2, plus and minus, well, that is this solution minus
<i>γ</i> over 2 square, minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square. I'm going to
assume in this calculation that <i>γ</i> over 2 is bigger than
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. Let's do that first. Then, you can see that
that's a negative number, that's a negative number, the whole thing is
negative, so <i>α</i> minus is definitely, let me see how I wrote it.
Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake here. I think these are called just
plus and minus <i>α</i>, <i>α</i> has two roots and I have to write
them as they are. Okay. I'm sorry. So please remove this, I put
unwanted sign there. Because they are the two answers for <i>α</i>. So,
I put <i>e</i> to the <i>α</i> plus <i>t</i>. So again, I should change
my answer here. I'm really sorry about this one. Now, I'm going to
write it below so you have a second chance. So, here is what it looks
like. <i>Ae</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over 2, plus square root of
<i>γ</i> over 2 square, minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square <i>t</i>,
plus <i>Be</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over 2 minus <i>γ</i> over 2
square minus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square <i>t</i>.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You forgot the minus.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: You forgot the minus in.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I think I did mean this. Or did
I get it wrong? These are the two values of <i>α</i>. So, they both
have the first number to be minus <i>γ</i> over 2, and the square root
comes for the plus sign for one of them and minus sign for the other
one. I probably have <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> mixed up. Let me check that.
No, I think even that's okay. Yes? I'm willing to be corrected if I got
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> mixed up. I know these are correct. I want to
make sure this is what I call <i>B</i>. <i>B</i> has a coefficient
<i>α</i> minus, which would be this one.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, yes. Yes. So, what should I
do, call this <i>A</i>? Call this <i>B</i>? How is that now? Let's see
if that works out. This should be <i>Be</i> to the <i>α</i> minus
<i>t</i>. <i>B</i> over the minus <i>γ</i> over 2 minus that. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay. The point of writing it
this way is to show you that both these powers, this is clearly a
positive number so it's <i>e</i> to the minus a negative number. I just
want to show you that this object--that's all I wanted to emphasize.
Inside the square brackets is also positive. Okay, this is <i>γ</i>
over 2. You can see this is a number smaller than <i>γ</i> over 2
square. So, if you take the square root of that number, it'll be
smaller than <i>γ</i> over 2, so this cannot overturn the sign of this.
It'll still be a positive over all signs to be negative; so, if you
draw the picture here, it's a sum of two exponentials, it'll just die
down after a while.</p>

<p>And how do I find <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>? To find <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, what I have to do is to take extra data, one of them may be
initial position, <i>x</i> of 0 is given to me. If <i>x</i> of 0 is
given to me as some number, I take the solution, I put <i>t</i> = 0 and
have it match this. If I put <i>t</i> = 0, well all this exponential
will vanish and I just get <i>A + B</i>, because <i>e</i> to the 0 is
1. So, I already have one condition on <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. Their sum
must be the initial position. How about their initial velocity? Go back
to this <i>x</i> and take <i>dx/dt</i>. What do you get? <i>dx/dt</i>
is <i>α</i> plus <i>A</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>α</i> plus <i>t</i>, plus
<i>α</i> minus <i>B</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>α</i> minus <i>t</i>. The
derivative of my answer is this. Evaluate it at <i>t</i> = 0. At
<i>t</i> = 0, you put <i>t</i> = 0 here, you find <i>x</i> dot of 0,
equal to <i>α</i> plus <i>A</i>, plus <i>α</i> minus <i>B</i>. So, here
are the two equations you need to find <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. Solve
these two simultaneous equations. In other words, I will tell you the
initial position and I will tell you the initial velocity. You will
take then this number, known, and that number known. This is a linear
simultaneous equation for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. You will fiddle around
and solve for <i>A</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Are <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> still complex numbers?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah. Now, we have to ask the
following question. In this problem, if everything is real--See
previously, what happened is when I took the complex conjugate of this
function, the conjugate turned into the other function, and the
conjugate of that function turned back into this one. That's why
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> were related, by complex conjugation. Here, if I
take the complex conjugate of <i>x</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>α</i> plus
<i>t</i>, if it's real, it remains itself. So, <i>A</i> just goes into
<i>A</i> star, <i>B</i> goes into <i>B</i> star, and you want the
answer to be unchanged. That requires <i>A</i> equal to <i>A</i> star
and <i>B</i> equal to <i>B</i> star. Thanks for pointing out that here.
We do want <i>A</i> equal to <i>A</i> star and <i>B</i> equal to
<i>B</i> star. So, what I'm telling you is go take the solution,
conjugate it and equate it to itself, and remember that now this
exponential remains real to begin with so it doesn't go into anything.
It remains itself, and I compare this exponential before and after its
coefficient that went from <i>A</i> to <i>A</i> star, they have to be
equal so <i>A</i> is <i>A</i> star and <i>B</i> is <i>B</i> star.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, look at these functions.
There are no complex numbers here. That's why everything is real. So,
what problems have I solved now? First, I put <i>γ</i> = 0. No
friction. And I just re-derived the harmonic oscillator because when I
got the <i>cos (ω<sub>0</sub> t - φ)</i>--Then I took a problem with
friction. Then, I got a solution that was just exponentially falling
because even though it looks like <i>α</i> plus, that's a negative
number, that's a negative number, in the end both are falling. It says
you pull the mass and let it go, it'll relax to its initial position,
it'll stop. But all of you must know that there's got to be something
in between. In the one case, I have a mass that oscillates forever, the
other case I have a mass when I pull it and let it go, it goes back to
equilibrium and reaches 0 at infinite time. But we all know that the
real situation you run into all the time when you pull something and
let it go; it vibrates and it vibrates less and less and less and less
and then eventually comes to rest. Where is that solution? It's got to
come out of this thing. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's correct. So, you've got
to go back to the roots I found. For <i>α</i>, it's minus <i>γ</i> over
2, plus or minus square root of <i>γ</i> over 2 square, minus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square. I've taken <i>γ</i> over 2 to be bigger
than <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. So, what I did was I turned on friction but
I didn't turn on a small amount of friction. I turned on a rather hefty
amount of friction so that the friction term was bigger than the
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> term. But if you imagine the other limit where you
have no friction and you turn on a tiny amount of friction, then the
tiny <i>γ</i> over 2 will be smaller than this <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. Of
course, then you've got the square root of a negative number, right?
So, you should really write it. So, let's take γ over 2 less than
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>, then you will write this as minus <i>γ</i> over
2, plus or minus <i>i</i> times <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square, minus
<i>γ</i> over 2 square. In other words, write this stuff inside as
minus of this number now, and take the square root of minus 1 and write
it as <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>So now, what do the solutions look like? They look like <i>x</i>
equal to <i>Ae</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over 2. Let me write the
exponentials if you like. <i>Ae</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over 2,
<i>t</i> plus <i>iω</i> prime <i>t</i>, but I'm going to call this
combination as <i>ω</i> prime. That's why we have <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>
and <i>ω</i> prime. Plus <i>Be</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over 2 minus
<i>iω</i> prime <i>t</i>. Now <i>e</i> to the minus <i>γ</i> over
<i>γt</i> over 2 is common to both the factors. You can pull it out.
Imagine pulling this factor out common to the whole expression. Then,
you just got <i>A</i> to the <i>iω</i> prime, plus <i>B</i> to the
minus <i>iω</i> prime. That's a very familiar problem. If you want that
to be real, you want <i>A</i> to be equal to the complex conjugate of
<i>B</i>. Then, you repeat everything I did before, so I don't want to
do that one more time. You will get some number C, times <i>e</i> to
the minus <i>γ</i> over 2<i>t</i>, times <i>cos ω</i> prime <i>t</i>,
plus, you can add a <i>φ</i>, if you like. There.</p>

<p>So, what does this look like? What does this graph look like? It
looks like <i>cos ωt</i> but it's got this thing in the front. If
<i>γ</i> vanishes, then forget the exponential completely. This is our
oscillating mass. If <i>γ</i> is not 0, imagine it's one part in
10,000, then for the first one second this number will hardly change
from 1. Meanwhile, this would have oscillated some number of times. But
if you wait long enough this exponential will start coming into play
and the way to think about it is, it's an oscillation whose amplitude
itself falls with time. And if you draw a picture of that, I think you
will not be surprised that if you draw the picture it will look like
this. It's called a damped oscillation.</p>

<p>So, that's the method by which you describe the three cases. One is
no friction and one is small friction or friction obeying this
condition, when you have oscillatory motion whose amplitude is damped
with time. Then you have the other case where the gammas has crossed
some threshold when <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> is smaller than <i>γ</i> over
2, then you get two falling exponentials.</p>

<p>So, what do you imagine the mass is doing? There's no friction if
you pull it and let it go; it vibrates forever. That's not very
realistic. If you turn a tiny amount of friction, it will do this,
which is very ubiquitous. We see it all the time. You pull a spring and
you let it go. After a while, it comes to rest. This tells you it never
quite comes to rest because as long as <i>t</i> is finite, this number
is going to be non-0, but it'll be very small. At some point you just
cannot see it. Third option is overdamped. Overdamped is when <i>γ</i>
is bigger than <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> over 2, then the answer has nothing
that oscillates. Nothing oscillates, everything falls exponentially
with time. That is, you should imagine you pull something, let it go,
it comes slowly and stops. When you buy your shocks in your car, the
shock absorbers, they're supposed to damp the vibration of the car.
It's got a spring suspending the tires, but it's immersed in some
viscous medium. So that is, vibrations are damped. So, when you hit a
bump, if your shocks are dead, you vibrate a lot of times and slowly
settle down. That's when your shocks are in this regime. When you
bought them, they were in this regime. When you bought them they were
doing this. Once you hit a bump and you overshoot from your position,
you come down to 0 and you stay there. That's the ideal situation for
damping. All right. So, I'm going to the last topic in oscillation but
is there anything that you need clarification? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah, yes. So, when <i>γ</i> over
2 equals <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>, this thing vanishes, and you seem to
have only one solution, <i>e</i> to the minus <i>γt</i> over 2. You
don't have the plus or minus, right. And we sort of know in every
problem there must be two solutions, because we should be able to pick
the initial position and velocity at will. If a solution has only one
free parameter, you cannot pick two numbers at will. Now, that's a
piece of mathematics I don't want to do now, but what you can show is
in that case, the second solution looks like this. It's a new function,
not an exponential but <i>t</i> times an exponential will solve the
equation. Those who want to see that this is true can put that into the
equation and check. In other words, pick your <i>γ</i> carefully so
that the square root vanishes. Only a <i>γ</i> is left, but that
<i>γ</i> is not independent of <i>ω</i>. That <i>γ</i> is equal to
2<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>. For that problem you can check that that's a
solution, so is that. There are nice ways to motivate that but I think
I don't have time to do that. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Why was <i>A</i> equal to
<i>A</i> star here? You mean here? Okay, take this <i>x</i>. Demand
that when you conjugate it nothing should happen, okay. In this
particular example, when <i>α</i> plus an <i>α</i> minus real numbers,
<i>e</i> to the <i>α</i> plus <i>t</i>, remains <i>e</i> to the
<i>α</i> plus <i>t</i> when you take conjugate. So therefore, <i>A</i>
has to remain <i>A</i> star, and <i>B</i> must also remain invariant
when you take the conjugation. In other words, if this was an imaginary
exponential like in the other problem, when you take the conjugate,
this exponential becomes this guy and that exponential becomes that
guy. Then, by matching the solution, you will be able to show this must
be the conjugate of that; that must be the conjugate of this. But if no
imaginary exponentials appear, each term must separately be real.</p>

<p>Now, this is something you will have to think about. I'm not saying
my repeating it makes it any clearer, so what I want you to do is take
the <i>x</i>, take the complex conjugate of <i>x</i>, equate the two
sides. There's a rule among functions that if you got <i>e</i> to the
plus <i>αt</i>, its coefficient should match on both sides and <i>e</i>
to the minus <i>αt</i> should have matching coefficients. It's like
saying when two vectors are equal, the coefficient of <i>I</i> should
match and the coefficient of <i>J</i> should match. There's a similar
theorem that if you take a sum of two independent functions, equate it
to the sum of [same] two independent functions, the coefficient must
separately match. If you impose that you will find what I told you.</p>

<p>Okay, now for the really interesting problem. The really interesting
problem is this. I got the mass, I got the spring, I got the friction,
but I'm going to apply an extra force, <i>F<sub>0</sub> cos ωt</i>.
This is called a "driven oscillator." So far, the oscillator was not
driven. In other words, no one is pushing and pulling it. Of course,
you pulled it in the beginning and you released it, but once you
released it, no one's touching the oscillator. The only forces on it
are due to internal frictional forces or spring force. But now, I want
to imagine a case where I am actively driving the oscillator by my
hand, exerting <i>cos ωt</i> force. So <i>ω</i> here is the frequency
of the driving force, okay. That's why there are so many <i>ω</i>s in
this problem. The <i>ω</i> prime that you saw here is not going to
appear too many times. It's a matter of convenience to call this
<i>ω</i> prime. But this <i>ω</i> will appear all the time. When I
write an <i>ω</i> with no subscript, it's the frequency of the driving
force, and the equation we want to solve is <i>x</i> double dot, plus
<i>γ</i> plus dot, plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square <i>x</i> equal to
<i>F</i> over <i>m</i>, because I divided everything by <i>m</i>,
<i>cos ωt</i>. So, we've got to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Now, this is really difficult because you cannot guess the answer to
this by a word problem. Now, you can do the following. If the
right-hand side had been <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i> instead of <i>cos
ωt</i>, you would be fine because then you can pick an <i>x</i> that
looks like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, and when you take two
derivatives that look like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, one derivative
would look like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>; <i>x</i> itself would look
like <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, you can cancel it on both sides. But
what you have is <i>cos ωt</i>.</p>

<p>So, here is what people do. It's a very clever trick. People say,
let me manufacture a second problem. Nobody gave me this problem. Okay,
this is a problem you gave me. I make up a new problem, the answer to
which is called <i>u</i>. But <i>y</i> is the answer to the following
problem. The driving force is <i>sin ωt</i>, but this is what you give
me to solve. This is my artifact. I introduced a new problem you did
not give me, but I want to look at this problem. Now, here is a trick.
You multiply this equation by any number; it's still going to satisfy
the equation. Let me multiply by <i>i</i>. Put an <i>i</i> here, put an
<i>i</i> here, put an <i>i</i> here, put an <i>i</i> here. Multiply
both sides by <i>i</i> and add them. Then I have got <i>x</i> plus
<i>iy</i>, double dot, plus <i>γ</i> times <i>x</i> dot, plus <i>iy</i>
dot is <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square times <i>x</i>, plus <i>iy</i>.</p>

<p>Let's introduce a number <i>z</i>, which is <i>x</i> plus <i>iy</i>.
It varies with time. Then this equation, by adding the two equations,
look like <i>z</i> double dot, plus <i>γz</i> dot, plus
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square <i>z</i> is <i>F</i> over <i>me</i> to the
<i>Iωt</i>. So, I have manufactured a problem in which the thing that's
vibrating is not a real number. The force driving it is also not a real
number. It's a <i>cos ωt</i> plus <i>I sin ωt</i>. But if I can solve
this problem by some trick, at the end what do I have to do? I have to
take the real part of the answer, because the answer will look like a
real part and an imaginary part; I'll have to dump the imaginary part.
That'll be the answer to the question I posed. The imaginary part of it
will be the answer to the fictitious question I posed.</p>

<p>Now, why am I doing this? The reason is the following. If the
driving force is <i>e</i> to the i<i>ωt</i>, I can make the following
<i>ansatz</i>, or a guess. <i>z</i> is some constant times <i>e</i> to
the <i>iωt</i>. I will show you now solutions of this form do exist,
because let me take that assumed form and put it into this equation.
Then, what do I get? I get minus <i>ω</i> square, <i>Z<sub>0</sub>e</i>
to the <i>iωt</i> because two derivatives of <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>
give me <i>iω</i> times <i>iω</i>. Then, one derivative gives me
<i>iω</i> times <i>γ</i>, times <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> e to the
<i>iωt</i>, and no derivatives, just leaves it alone, <i>e</i> to the
<i>iωt</i> equals <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the
<i>iωt</i>. So, let me rewrite this as follows. Let me rewrite this as
minus <i>ω</i> square, plus <i>iωγ</i>, plus <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i>
square, times <i>z<sub>0</sub>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, is <i>F</i> over
<i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>. This is what I want to be true.
Well, <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, whatever it is, can be canceled on
two sides because it is not 0. Anything that's not 0 you can always
cancel, and here is the interesting result you learn. For this equation
to be valid, the <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> that you pick here in your guess
satisfies the condition, <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> equals <i>F</i> over
<i>m</i> divided by <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square minus <i>ω</i> square,
plus <i>iωγ</i>.</p>

<p>Now, parts of it may be easy, parts of it may be difficult. The easy
part is to take the guess I made and stick it into the equation, cancel
exponentials and get the answer. What you should understand is,
<i>x</i> was what I was looking for. I brought in a partner <i>y</i>,
and I solved for <i>z</i>, which is <i>x</i> plus <i>iy</i>, and
<i>z</i> was assumed to take this form with the amplitude, which itself
could be complex, times <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>. If
<i>z<sub>0</sub></i> looks like this, then <i>z</i>, which is
<i>z<sub>0</sub>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>, looks like <i>F</i> over
<i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i> divided by this number in the
denominator, I'm going to call <i>I</i> for impedance. <i>I</i> is
called impedance and there's the following complex number,
<i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square, minus <i>ω</i> square, plus
<i>iωγ</i>.</p>

<p>Okay, we're almost done now. The <i>z</i> looks like
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>Iωt</i> divided
by this complex number <i>I</i>. Imagine this complex number <i>I</i>.
What does it look like? It's a got a real part and an imaginary part.
Imaginary part is <i>iωγ</i>, real part is <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square
minus <i>ω</i> square. This is the complex number <i>I</i>. So, we are
told the answer to our problem is to find this number <i>z</i>, then
take the real part. Does everybody agree that every complex number I
can be written as an absolute value times <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i>.
<i>φ</i>, which is going to be here. And I'm going to write it that way
because now things become a lot simpler if you write it that way.
<i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, divided by absolute value of
<i>i</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i>, <i>e</i> to the <i>iωt</i>. Now,
this <i>e</i> to the <i>iφ</i>, I can delete it here and put it
upstairs as minus <i>iφ</i>. So, let me write it in that form. Then
it's very easy. <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, divided by the
magnitude of this <i>I</i>, times <i>e</i> to the <i>Iωt</i> minus
<i>φ</i>, where <i>φ</i> is this angle. Well, now that <i>I</i> got
<i>z</i>, I know how to find <i>x</i>. <i>x</i> is the real part of
<i>z</i>. Now, when I look at real part, all of these are real numbers
so I will keep them as they are. <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>
divided by <i>i</i>, and the real part of this function, I hope you
know by now, is <i>cos ωt</i> minus <i>φ</i>.</p>

<p>And that's the answer. The answer to the problem that was originally
given to us is the following. You know the magnitude of the applied
force, the amplitude of the applied force. You know the mass of the
particle. You need to find the absolute value of <i>I</i> and <i>φ</i>.
For that, you construct this complex number whose real part is this,
whose imaginary part is <i>iωγ</i>. Then, the absolute value of
<i>I</i> is just by Pythagoras' theorem, <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square
minus <i>ω</i> square square, plus <i>ω</i> square <i>γ</i> square. And
the phase <i>φ</i> obeys the condition <i>tan</i> <i>φ</i> is equal to
<i>ωγ</i> divided by <i>ω<sub>0</sub></i> square, minus <i>ω</i> square
square is <i>ω</i> square <i>γ</i> square. I'm sorry. It's just the
imaginary part over the real part.</p>

<p>So, this is the answer to the problem that was given to us. But
there's one subtle point you should notice, which is the following.
Where are the three parameters in this problem? Everything is
determined in this problem. <i>φ</i>, absolute <i>I</i>, all these are
known, but we know every equation should have two free numbers. You
know what they are? Anybody know? Okay, let me tell you what the answer
to that question is. I'm saying, I can add to this the solution I got
earlier on without the driving force, because in this problem, when I
had a right-hand side with a driving force, let me add a 0 to that.
That's harmless, and by superposition principle, if that force will
produce that displacement, 0 will produce what? Well, we have seen all
morning that even when the right-hand side is 0, they are the solutions
I got for you. <i>e</i> to the <i>γ</i> over 2 <i>cos ω</i> prime
<i>t</i> etc., so you can always add to this, what you call a
complementary function, which is the solution of the equation with no
driving force, which is what we were studying earlier in the class. But
usually, people don't bother with this because they all have in them
<i>e</i> to the minus <i>γt</i> over 2. So, if you wait long enough,
this will die out, and this is the only thing that will remain. So at
earlier times, this is not the full answer. You should add to this the
answer when there is no driving force and together they form the full
answer, and the numbers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> that you have there will
be chosen to match some initial conditions, like initial position,
initial velocity.</p>

<p>Okay now, time is up. I'm going to stop, so I have not been able to
finish some parts of this, so I'm trying to see what I can do. I had
asked for you to give this problem set to me on--what is this today? On
Wednesday, right. So, you don't have enough time. I mean, I haven't
taught you a few other things you need about five minutes more of work.
I don't want to keep you back. So, here is what I will do. I will post
on the website some notes on just the missing part here, so you can
read it and you can do one or two problems you may not be able to do
without that. Then, I will come on Wednesday, I will teach that to you
again, but you will be able to hand in your problem set. Okay.</p>
