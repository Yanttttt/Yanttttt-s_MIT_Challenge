<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Let me remind you that
everything I did so far in class came from analyzing the Lorentz
transformations. And you guys should be really on top of those two
marvelous equations, because all the stuff we are doing is a
consequence of that. I won't go over how we derive them, because I've
done it more than once. But I remind you that if you've got an event
that occurs at x,t for one person, and to a person moving to the right,
at velocity <i>u</i>, the same event will have coordinates <i>x' = x -
ut/√</i> and t<sup>'</sup> = (t - ux/C<sup>2</sup>)/√. This is it. This
is the key. From this, by taking differences of two events, you can get
similar equations for coordinate differences. In other words, if two
events are separated in space by <i>Δ</i>x for one person and
<i>Δ</i>x' for another person and likewise in time, then you get
similar formula for differences. So, differences are related the same
way that coordinates themselves are. But I will write it anyway,
because I will use it sometimes one way and sometimes the other way.
Even this one you can think of as a formula for a difference, except
one of the coordinates, or the origin. This isn't generally, if you've
got two events, not necessarily at the origin, then there's spatial
separation and time separation are connected in this fashion.</p>

<p>So, I put this to work. I got a lot of consequences from that. You
remember that? For example, I said, take a clock that you are carrying
with you. Or let's take a clock that I'm carrying with me and let's see
how it looks to you. And let's say it goes tick and it goes tick one
more time. So for me, the time difference between the two ticks will
be, let's say, one second. It's a one-second clock. The space
difference is zero because the clock is not going anywhere for me. So
for you, <i>Δt' =</i> 1<i>s/√</i> which is more than one second. So you
will say, hey, the time your clock ticked one second, I really claimed
two seconds have passed. Therefore, you will say my clocks are running
slow. And it's easy to see, from the same equations, that if you
replace the prime and unprimed ones, simply change <i>u</i> to
<i>-u</i>, nothing changes. The clock that you think is set best with
respect to you will look slow to me.</p>

<p>Then, I showed you how when you wanted to measure the length of a
stick which is traveling past you, you get your assistants on the--who
are all lined up on the <i>x</i> axis to measure the two ends of the
rod, or any particular time they like. Take the special difference.
That's the meaning of the length of a moving rod. You've got to measure
both ends at the same time. So, you make sure the two measurements are
done at the same time, so <i>Δt = 0</i>. The distance between them is
what I call the length of the rod. You are moving with the rod. And as
long as you're moving with the rod, the rod has got two points which
are separated by the length L<sub>0</sub>. And one thing occurs at one
end, another thing occurs at the other end. The spatial difference
between them will be simply the length of the rod in your frame of
reference. So, <i>l</i> will be <i>L<sub>0</sub></i> times--if you
bring the square root to the other side, <i>L</i> will be
<i>L<sub>0</sub></i>√ whereas <i>Δt'</i> would be some <i>Δτ</i> under
this frame, divided by the square root. Okay. Now, the important result
I showed you was a lack of simultaneity. It's not absolute. So, I
started with unfortunate example of twins born in Los Angeles and New
York, and you guys were pointing out that no normal woman could do
that, except the one from "your momma" jokes. "Your momma" jokes; your
momma is so big she can have a kid in New York. So, I don't want to
deal with such cosmological objects right now.</p>

<p>So, I will say, pick a better example. Two things happen. Something
here, something there, separated by distance. People cannot agree that
they were simultaneous. Now, you've got to say, it is very surprising,
people cannot agree on length difference between two events. For
example, New York and Los Angeles; over 3000 miles apart. We think you
can move in a train; you can move in a plane. You all have to agree on
the separation, but you don't. That's just a consequence of now the new
relativity. In the old days, before I did relativity, I was taking just
the good old <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates. And I said you can take
a point, you can assign to it some coordinates <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
Then, somebody comes along with a rotated axis, but no one seems to be
troubled by the fact that the same point is now given a new set of
coordinates by this new person. Or take a pair of points on this line.
For that person in the rotated system, these events have the same
<i>y'</i> coordinate. Because you see, this is the <i>y '=</i> 0 axis.
It occurred at the same <i>y'</i>, but for me, they're not the same
<i>y</i> coordinate, because that has that <i>y</i> coordinate; that's
a different <i>y</i> coordinate. So, we are fully used to the fact that
having the same <i>x</i> coordinate for two events is not an absolute
statement difference on the frame of reference. Having the same
<i>y</i> coordinates is also not absolute. But somehow, in the case of
time, we used to think that time differences are absolute and spatial
differences are absolute. And what we are learning is no, they are just
like the <i>x</i> and the <i>y</i>. Okay.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to do one more thing with the Lorentz transformation.
This is pretty interesting. Let's take this equation for time
difference; <i>Δt' = Δt - uΔx</i> over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> divided by
this. So, let's take two events. First, something happens; then,
something else happens. And <i>Δt</i> is a separation in time between
them, <i>t<sub>2</sub> - t<sub>1</sub></i>. Let's say <i>t<sub>2</sub>
- t<sub>1</sub></i> is positive, so <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, the second
event, occurred after the first event, according to me. How about
according to you? Well, <i>Δt'</i> doesn't have to have the same sign
as <i>Δt</i>, because you can subtract this number, <i>uΔx</i> over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>; <i>Δx</i> can be whatever you like. Therefore,
you can find that <i>Δt'</i> could be negative for you. And you've got
to understand, that's a big deal. I say this happened first and that
happened later. Then, you say, no, it happened the opposite way. Now,
this can lead to serious logical contradictions, especially if event
one is the cause of event two. This is a standard example both in
special and general relativity that people talk about; event one is
somebody's grandmother is born. And event two, that person is born. We
say the birth of the kid takes place long after the birth of the
grandmother, according to me. What if, in some other point of view, the
kid is born, but the grandmother is not yet born. And somebody goes and
assassinates the grandmother. This is--In fact, this is called killing
the grandmother. These words are taken right out of textbooks. Why this
kind of violence is inflicted on grandmothers I don't know, but it's a
standard example. All logical contradictions involving time travel have
to come--have to do with coming back and doing something.</p>

<p>So, here's an example. The grandchild is born. Grandmother is not
yet born, and something is done, you know, to prevent her from being
born or two seconds after she is born, she is hit by the mafia. How do
you explain the grandchild? Where did the grandchild come from? Because
the cause has been eliminated. Or, event 1, I fired a bullet. Event
two, somebody is hit. And you go to frame of reference in which the
person has been hit and I haven't fired the bullet. So, you come and
you finish me off. So now, we've got this person dying for no apparent
reason because the cause has been eliminated. That simply cannot
happen. Einstein recognized that there is a limit to how far he can
push this community, and he conceded that if <i>A</i> can be the cause
of <i>B</i>, you better not find an observer for whom they occur in
reverse order. Because if the cause occurs after the effect, then there
is some time left for somebody to prevent the cause itself from
happening and we have an effect with no perceivable cause. So, we want
to make sure that <i>Δt'</i> cannot be reversed whenever the first
event could be the cause of the second event. So, you go and ask this
equation: if <i>Δt</i> is positive, when will <i>Δt'</i> be negative?
That is simple algebra; you want this term to beat that term. So,
that'll happen if <i>u</i>, <i>Δx--</i>let me put a <i>c</i> here,
another <i>c</i> here, is greater than <i>Δt</i>. If that happens,
things are going to happen backwards, right? So, let's modify that a
little bit by putting this <i>c</i> over here, and rewrite it finally
as <i>u</i> over cis bigger than<i>cΔt</i> over <i>Δx</i>. Let's
understand what this equation means. This equation means that if there
were two events separated in time by <i>Δt</i> and in space by
<i>Δx</i>, I can find an observer, at a certain speed <i>u</i>, so that
<i>u</i> divided by <i>c</i>, if it exceeds this number, for that
observer, the time order of the events will be reversed. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's not yet clear the velocity
is greater than <i>c</i>. It depends on what's happening in the top and
bottom. You have to ask. What is <i>cΔt</i>? Remember, <i>Δt</i> is a
time between two events. <i>cΔt</i> is what? It's the distance a light
pulse can travel in that time. The denominator is a spatial separation
between those two events. Event 1 is here, event 2 is there; <i>cΔt</i>
is how far a light signal can travel in the time separating these two
events. If <i>cΔt</i> looks like that, then there's enough time for a
light signal to go from here to here. In that case, <i>cΔt</i> would be
bigger than <i>Δx</i>, but then the velocity that you want of your
frame will be bigger than one, and that's not possible in units of
speed of light. The only time you will get a sensible value for the
second frame, namely with <i>u/c &lt;</i> 1 would be if <i>cΔt &lt;
Δx</i>; that means, here's the first event and here's the second event.
A light signal could have only gone from there to there in the time
between the events. So, it is saying that if two events are such that
there was not enough time for a light signal to leave the first event
and arrive in time for the second event, then we can actually find an
observer with the sensible velocity for whom the order of events is
reversed. Therefore, what have we learned from this? We learned from
this that it should not be--if there is enough time for a light signal
to go from one event to the other event, then we will not play around
with the order of events. But if there is no time even for the light
signal to go, the system in fact allows you to see them in reverse
order.</p>

<p>But we have seen that events which are causally connected, the order
cannot be reversed or should not be reversed. So, what this is saying
is, it should be impossible for an event here to affect a second event
by using a signal faster than light. In other words, we are going to
say that if there wasn't enough time for a light signal to go from this
event to that event, then this event could not have been the cause of
that event. We will demand that. Therefore, what the theory for it to
be make logical sense is, no signal should travel faster than the speed
of light. Because if you had a signal that can travel faster than the
speed of light, then the first event could have been the cause of the
second event, because you send the signal and the signal may blow
something up, but that is not enough time for light to get there in the
same time. But if you allowed such things, then you will find a frame
of reference with a velocity perfectly sensible in which they occur
backwards, and cause and effect will have been reversed.</p>

<p>So, the answer to the whole thing, in case you're still struggling
with this issue, is the following. What the theory of relativity
demands is that it should be impossible for events to influence other
events with signals traveling faster than light. Once you accept that,
there is no logical contradiction in the theory, because the only time
events are reversed is in when there is no time for light signal to go
from here to there. That means there was no way this could have been
the cause of that. For example, when I fire a bullet, the cause is my
firing of the bullet, the effect is whatever happens to the recipient.
And the whole thing takes place at the speed equal to speed of the
bullet. In that case, <i>cΔt</i> is definitely bigger than <i>Δx</i>,
because in the time it took the bullet to go from here to there, the
light pulse could have also gone there and beyond. In that case, you'll
never find an observer at a speed less than that of light for whom the
events will appear backwards. So, the special theory of relativity is
another way to ensure that everything is consistent is to demand that
no signal travels faster than the speed of light. No energy, no signal
can travel that fast.</p>

<p>But this leads to something very interesting. Our view of space-time
is now modified, you see? In the old days, here is space and here is
time. And let's say <i>(0,0)</i> is where I am right now. I am at the
origin, my clock says zero; I'm here right now. Any dot I pick here is
in my future, because <i>t</i> is positive for the events. They have
not happened yet. Any dot I draw here is an event in my past, because
it occurred at an earlier time. So, in the Newtonian view of the world,
there is something called right now, this horizontal line. And
everything above it is called later or future. Everything below it is
called past. But in special relativity, after you've taken into account
a relativistic thing, let's draw here an axis <i>ct</i>. So, whenever
you have another event so that <i>ct &gt; x</i>, there is enough time
for a light signal to go from here to here. That's the meaning of
saying <i>ct &gt; x</i>. This is the line <i>ct = x</i>. This is the
line <i>ct &gt; x</i>. This event is in the future of this event
according to me, and also according to anybody else. In other words,
<i>Δt</i> is positive for me, but if you go back to these equations,
since <i>cΔt &gt; x</i>, you will never find anybody who said this
event occurred earlier than this event.</p>

<p>Another way to understand it is if I want to cause that event,
suppose that is some explosion going off there. I send a signal that
goes and makes that happen. That signal has to travel slower than light
to get there. Therefore, it could have caused the event. And therefore,
there is no screwing around with the order of that event. That is in my
future according to me and according to all observers. If you take an
event here, so this is called--this whole event north of this 45 degree
line is called the "absolute future." By "absolute," I mean future of
me not only according to me, but according to all observers. For every
observer, this will occur later than this. It won't be later by the
same number of seconds, but it will be later. So, the <i>Δt</i> between
this event and this event is positive for me, will be positive for all
people. They will all agree this occurred after this; therefore, the
effect appeared before the cause. Sorry, the cause will appear before
the effect.</p>

<p>And it is not really necessary that this event be caused by this
event. It's only necessary that it could have been caused by this event
because not everything in the universe is caused by some other event.
It can just simply happen. We have heard that; stuff happens. So, stuff
happens here with no obvious cause, as long as this in the future,
according to me; by this definition, it's in the future according to
all people. So, this is called the future because you can affect it.
For example, if I heard something terrible is going to happen at this
point, I can send my guys to go over there and do something. They have
to travel at a speed that is less than the speed of light so they can
affect it. These events are called the "absolute past." What that
means, any event here could have been the cause of what's happening to
me right now because from that event, a signal can be sent to arrive
where I am right now at a speed less than the speed of light. This
line, which is called the light cone, is a borderline case where you
can communicate from here to here using a light signal. So, that's also
considered a future.</p>

<p>But what about an event here? Suppose this distance is two seconds
times the velocity of light. That has not happened yet. And suppose I
go there and open my envelope and say something terrible is going to
happen at this point. There is nothing I can do. There's nothing I can
do. In the Newtonian days, there's something you can do. Tell someone
else to really hurry up and get there and do something. But now you
cannot do that because for that someone to leave you with the
instruction to do something about this requires that person to travel
faster than light, and that's not allowed. So, even though you know
things can happen here in the future, and you have knowledge of the
fact that someone is planning to do something there, you cannot get
there. Okay? That's a very important thing even for people who are
going to law school. And all of you guys are not going into physics.
But suppose you're going to law school. You've got the DNA defense,
right? My client's DNA doesn't match. Here's another defense. If your
client was accused of doing something here, and was last seen here, you
can argue that my client was outside the light cone. That's called
outside the light cone defense, and it's absolutely water-tight. It's
better than anything because if that event is outside the light cone of
your client, the client cannot be held responsible, because your client
will have to send a signal faster than light, and that law is
unbroken.</p>

<p>So, what about the status of an event like this? The status of this
event is, I can actually find other observers moving at a speed less
than light, but for whom this event occurs before this event. So, order
of events can be reversed. But it will not lead to logical
contradictions because we know the two events are not causally
connected. So, space and time, we just divide into upper half plane and
lower half plane. The future and past, and a tiny sliver called present
now divided into three regions; the absolute future that you can
affect, the absolute past whose events can affect you, and this
is--now, it doesn't have a name. If you want, you can call it the
relative future according to you, but I'll find somebody to whom that
occurs before this one. Okay? That's also a consequence of the Lorentz
transformation. So, you can see that the equations are very deceptively
simple. In fact, they're a lot easier looking than some equations with
angular momentum, right? But the consequences are really stupendous.
They all follow from that equation. And of course, if you invent a
theory like this, you've got to make sure that there are no
contradictions, right?</p>

<p>Suppose you find a theory, you're very happy with everything;
velocity of light is coming out right. But somebody points out to you
that the order of events can be reversed. And you've got to agree
you'll be in a panic because, how can I reverse the order of events?
And the theory is so beautiful; internally, it says you can reverse the
order of events if they could not have been causally connected. Where
the causally connected means a signal traveling at a speed less than
light could not have gone from the first or the second event. Then, the
theory does not allow them to be--If a signal could have gone, it
allows them to be never reversed. If a signal could not have gone, it
does say you can find people for whom events occurred in the reverse
order. Alright. So, this is the second thing, and it's called the light
cone for the following reason. I've only shown you an <i>x</i>
coordinate. If we had a <i>y</i> coordinate coming out of the
blackboard, the surface would look like a cone. That's why we call it
the light cone. Sitting at a point in four-dimensional space-time,
there's a cone. And all points in that forward light cone are the
events you can affect. All points in the backward light cone are events
that can come and get you right now. And the rest of the thing outside
the two cones, you cannot do anything about, even though you know
something is going to happen. And they cannot do anything to you. You
open an envelope, and it says somebody here is planning to do something
to you. You don't have to worry, because that person cannot get to you
in the time available. Because the fastest signal is the light signal,
and that won't get there. And neither will anything else. Alright.</p>

<p>Now, we're going to do something which is theoretically or
mathematically very pretty. So, for those of you who like mathematical
elegance, this is certainly the best example I can offer you, because
it is simple and also rather profound. But it's completely by analogy.
The analogy is the following. We have seen that when we rotate our
axis, as I've shown there, that the <i>x'</i> is not the same as
<i>x</i> related by this formula. And <i>y'</i> is also not the same as
<i>y</i> related by this formula. Nothing is sacred. Coordinates of a
point are not sacred. They are just dependent on who is looking at them
from what orientation. But even in this world, we noticed that
<i>x<sup>'2</sup> + y'<sup>2</sup></i> is the same as <i>x<sup>2</sup>
+ x<sup>2</sup></i>. Namely, the length of the point connecting the
origin to you, or the distance from the origin is unaffected by
rotations. This is called an invariant. This doesn't depend on who is
looking at it. Everyone will agree on this. But they won't agree on
<i>x</i> and they won't agree on <i>y</i>, but they will agree on this.
So, it's reasonable to ask in the relativistic case, where people
cannot agree on time coordinate or space coordinate, maybe the square
of the time plus the square of the space will be the same for two
people. One can ask that question. So, when we look at that, we'll find
out that that's not the case; <i>t<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup></i> is
not invariant. But even before you do that, you should shudder at the
prospect of writing something like this. Right? What's wrong with
this?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Good. Everyone's on top of the
units here. So, you cannot add <i>t<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup></i>.
There is no way this can be anything. So, we know how we have to fix
that. We've got to have either both coordinates in space-time measured
with lengths or with time. The standard trick is to do the following.
Let's introduce an object with two components. I'm going to call it
<i>X</i>. The first component of that is going to be called
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i>--is going to be called <i>X<sub>0</sub></i>. The
second is going to be called <i>X<sub>1</sub></i>.
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i>, I mean, <i>X<sub>1</sub></i> is just our familiar
<i>x</i>. <i>X<sub>0</sub></i> is going to be essentially time, but
multiplied by <i>c</i>. Why do I switch from <i>t</i> and <i>x</i> to
zero and one? It is just that if you want to go back to more
coordinates, if you want to bring back <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>, then I
just mention for future use that in four dimensions you really have
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>2</sub></i> and
<i>X<sub>3</sub></i>. That is a shorthand for <i>X<sub>0</sub></i> and
what you and I used to call the position <i>r</i> of a particle. It's
just that in one dimension, the vector <i>r</i> becomes a number
<i>x</i>, and I want to call the number <i>X<sub>1</sub></i> because
it's the first of the three coordinates. And if you're doing super
strings, you can have ten coordinates, and one will be
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i> and the nine will be spatial coordinates. So, we
like the numerical index rather than letters in the alphabet because we
run out of letters. But you don't run out of these subscripts. So, I'm
writing it purposely in many ways, because if you ever go read
something or you're involved in a lab project or the group is studying
something and you want to read the paper, people who refer to
coordinates in space-time in many ways. Some will call it--Some people
like to write the <i>X</i> the following way; <i>X<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>X<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>3</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>4</sub></i>, but
<i>X<sub>4</sub></i> is <i>ct</i>. That's why you call that the fourth
dimension. But still, the fourth dimension, but you can either put it
at the end of that first family of three or at the beginning. So, it's
very common for people to use either notation. I'm just going to call
it <i>X<sub>0</sub></i>. <i>X<sub>0</sub></i> is just time, okay,
multiplied by <i>c</i> so that it has units of length and multiplying
by <i>c</i> doesn't do anything. Everybody agrees on what <i>c</i> is.
So, we're all multiplying our time coordinates by <i>c</i>.
Alright.</p>

<p>So, let's ask the following question. What does the Lorentz
transformation look like when I write it in terms of these numbers? So,
first take <i>x'</i> is <i>x - ut</i> divided by the famous square
root. But <i>t</i> is not what I want; <i>ct</i> is what I want. So, I
fudge it as follows; I write it as (<i>x - u/cct)/(</i>1 <i>-
u<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)</i>. This I'm going to write as <i>x</i>
is now called <i>X<sub>1</sub></i>, and I'm going to introduce a new
symbol <i>β</i> here. This guy is called <i>X<sub>0</sub>/</i>1 <i>-
β<sup>2</sup></i>. But <i>β</i> is universal convention for <i>u/c</i>.
If all the velocities are measured as a fraction of the velocity of
light, then <i>β</i> is a number between zero and one. So, the final
way I want to write the Lorentz transformation for coordinate is that
<i>X<sub>1</sub>' = (X<sub>1</sub> - βX<sub>0</sub>)/√</i>. So, you
have to get used to this <i>β</i>. I mean, you're following nicely what
I was saying in terms of velocity <i>u</i>, but you have to get used to
this <i>β</i>. We won't use it a whole lot, but I put it here so you
can recognize it when people refer to it in the literature, when you go
read something.</p>

<p>What's the transformation law for time? Remember <i>t' = (t -
ux/c<sup>2)</sup>/(√</i>1 <i>- β<sup>2</sup>)</i>. <i>β<sup>2</sup></i>
is clearly what's sitting downstairs. <i>u/c</i> is <i>β</i>. So, what
do you think we should do? We should multiply both sides by <i>c</i>.
Because if you multiply both sides by <i>c</i>, put a <i>c</i> there,
put a <i>c</i> there and get rid of this one, then you find
<i>X<sub>0</sub>'</i> is (<i>X<sub>0</sub> - βX<sub>1</sub>)/(√</i>1
<i>- β<sup>2</sup>)</i>. So, let me write that here. Now, you see the
relationship with the coordinates is nice and symmetric. If you write
in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>, the coordinates transformation law
is not quite symmetric. And that's because one has units of length and
one has units of time. But if you rescale your time to turn it into a
length, then the transformation laws are very simple and symmetric
between the two coordinates and space-time.</p>

<p>There are also the other coordinates; the <i>y</i> direction,
<i>X<sub>2</sub>'</i> = <i>X<sub>2</sub></i> and in the <i>z</i>
direction, <i>X<sub>3</sub>'</i> = <i>X<sub>3</sub></i>. In other
words, the length is perpendicular to the motion, or something you can
always agree on. One can talk and talk about why that is true.
Basically, what we are saying is, if you are zooming along, and you
drew a line that says <i>y =</i> 1 and originally we agreed on it, we
will have to agree on it even when I start moving relative to you,
because you've got your own line. And there's no reason your line
should be above my line or should be above your line or below your
line. If the lines originally agreed, there is no reason why my line is
above yours or your line is below mine, because by symmetry, there's no
reason why one should be higher than the other. And the reason this is
required is that the two lines, which last forever, can be compared
anywhere you like. Unlike the rods, which are running away from each
other and cannot be compared, the line here which says <i>y =</i> 3 has
got to be <i>y =</i> 3 for both of us. So, the transverse coordinates
are not modified. So, that's why I don't talk about them too much. All
the interesting action is between any one coordinate along which the
motion is taking place and time. So now, let's ask ourselves maybe
<i>X<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> + X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup></i> is the
same as this square plus that square. Well, let me just tell you that
I'm not going to try something that I know will not work. In other
words, you might think <i>X<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> +
X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup>=X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> +
X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. Well, that just doesn't work. That
doesn't work because 1<i>/√</i> is not a <i>cos θ</i>, and <i>β/√</i>
is not a <i>sin θ</i>. You cannot make them cosine and sine of
something. If you could, that'll work. But it doesn't work. But I'll
tell you what does work.</p>

<p>Let's take <i>X<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> -
X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup></i>, the square of the time coordinate minus
the square of the space coordinate with a minus. So, let's try to do
this in our head by squaring this and subtracting it from the square of
this one. Downstairs, I think we all agree you get <i>1 -
β<sup>2</sup></i> because the square root is squared. How about
upstairs? First, you've got to square this guy, this guy will give you
<i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + β<sup>2</sup>X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>
-</i> 2<i>βX<sub>0</sub>X<sub>1</sub></i>. From that, I should subtract
the square of <i>X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup></i>. That'll give me
-<i>X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - β<sup>2</sup>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>
+</i> 2<i>βX<sub>0</sub>X<sub>1</sub></i>. Just simple algebra. And
these cross terms cancel out. And you notice I got an
<i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>(</i>1 <i>- β<sup>2</sup>)
-X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>(</i>1 <i>- β<sup>2</sup></i>), right? This
algebra, I trust you guys can do at home. And the result of this is
going to be <i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> -
X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. That's very nice. It says that even
though people cannot agree on the time or space coordinate of an event,
just like saying people cannot agree on what is <i>X</i> and what is
<i>Y</i>, they can agree on this quadratic function you form out of the
coordinates. But it's very different from ordinary rotations, where you
take the sum of the squares; here you've got to take the difference of
the squares. And that's just the way it is. Even though time is like
another coordinate that mixes with space, it's not quite the same. In
other words, if I brought back all the transverse coordinates, then you
will find <i>X<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> - X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup> -
X<sub>2</sub>'<sup>2</sup> - X<sub>3</sub>'<sup>2</sup> =
X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> -
X<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - X<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. This you can
do because <i>X<sub>1</sub>'</i> individually is equal to
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i>. So, you can put them on both sides. This is the
actual four-dimensional result for people who really want to leave the
<i>x</i> axis and move freely in space, which you're allowed to. This
is the invariant. This is the object that everyone agrees on. Allow me
once again to drop this. Most of the time, I'm not going to worry about
transverse coordinates.</p>

<p>So, this is the analogue of the length square of a vector, and it's
called the space-time interval. It's not the space interval; it's not
the time interval. It's a space-time interval between the origin and
the point (<i>x,t)</i>. And this is denoted by the symbol--there's no
universal formula, but let's use <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> for space-time
separation. Notice that even though it's called <i>s<sup>2</sup></i>,
<i>s<sup>2</sup></i> need not be always positive, definite. You can
take two events, but if the time coordinate is the same, or the time
coordinate is zero, the space coordinate is not zero, then
<i>s<sup>2</sup></i> will be negative. Whereas the usual Pythagoras
length square, <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></i> is positive
definite, always positive, the space-time interval can be positive or
negative or zero. It's positive if <i>X<sub>0</sub></i> can beat the
sum of the squares of those guys. It's negative if they can beat
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i> and it's equal to zero if
<i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> equal to that square.</p>

<p>So, if you want, if you go back to this diagram I drew here, this is
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i>. This is <i>X<sub>0</sub> = ct</i>. These are
events for which <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is positive. These are also
events for which <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is positive. These are events for
which <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is negative. These are events in which
<i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is zero. So, whenever <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> is
positive, we have a name for that. It's called a time-like separation.
Well, it's called time-like separation because the time-part of the
separation squared is able to beat the space-part of the separation.
It's got more time component than space component. Now, you can also do
the following. Let me introduce some rotation now. Let us agree that we
will use <i>X</i> for a space-time with what's called a four-vector. A
four-vector has got four components. And the components are
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i>, and since I'm tired of writing,
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>3</sub></i>, I
will call it <i>r</i>. So, in the special theory of relativity, what
you do is, you take the three components of space and add one more of
time and form a vector with four components. And we will agree that the
note symbol for a space-time vector is an <i>X</i>. Now, I've been
careless in my writing. Sometimes I use <i>x</i> and <i>X</i>, but you
guys should be a little more careful. <i>X</i> like this, but no
subscript, will stand for these four numbers. It is a four-vector. It's
a four-vector; it's a vector living in space-time. And when you've got
another frame of reference, the components of four-vector will mix with
each other. Then, we're going to define a dot product. It's going to be
a funny dot product. It's going to be called <i>X∙X</i>. Usual dot
product was some of the squares of the components. But this funny dot
product will be equal to <i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> minus the
length of the spatial part, squared.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Is that a small x?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> This is an <i>X</i>. These are
all small. <i>X</i> is the name for a vector with four components. It's
a position vector in space-time. These are--This is the same as writing
<i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> -
X<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - X<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. Suppose
there are two events. One occurs at the space-time coordinate <i>X</i>.
The second event occurs at a new point, let me call it
<i>X<sub>bar</sub></i>, whose time coordinate <i>X<sub>0bar</sub></i>,
whose position coordinate, this is unfortunate, vector <i>r</i> with a
bar on it. These are like two vectors in the <i>x,y</i> plane. You and
I, if we are going relative to each other, will not agree on the
components of this or the components of that. But we will agree on
<i>X∙X'</i>. In other words, <i>X∙X</i> will be the same as
<i>X'∙X<sub>bar</sub>'</i>. What I'm saying is, if we go to a moving
frame of reference, the components of the vector <i>X</i> goes into
<i>X'</i>, whose components are <i>X<sub>0</sub>'</i> and some
<i>r'</i>. And likewise, the vector <i>X<sub>bar</sub></i> has new
components; <i>X<sub>bar</sub>'</i>, which are <i>X<sub>0bar</sub>'</i>
and <i>r<sub>bar</sub><b>'</b>.</i></p>

<p>Look, it's a story as the same like in two dimensions. Components of
vectors are arbitrary. They vary with the frame of reference. But the
dot product of vectors is the same no matter how you rotate your axis,
because the dot product is length of <i>A</i> times length of <i>B</i>
times cosine of the angle between them. None of the three things
changes when you rotate your axis. Well, this is the analogue of the
dot product in space-time because this is the guy that's same for
everybody. You can say, "Why don't you study this combination?" It's so
nice. All pluses. I like that. I don't study that because that
combination is not special. If I have one value for the combination,
you will have a different value for the combination. There's nothing
privileged. It's the one with the minus signs in it that has the
privileged role of playing the role of the dot product. So, space-time
is not Euclidean. Euclidean space is the space in which we live, and
distance squared is the sum of the squares of all the coordinates. So,
it's a pseudo-Euclidean space in which to find the invariant length,
you've got to square some components and subtract from them the square
of some other components. Okay.</p>

<p>So, finally, if you take a difference vector, in other words, take
the difference of two events, then the spatial coordinate according to
me, the difference in space coordinate, namely, <i>cΔt<sup>2</sup> -
Δx<sup>2</sup></i> will be <i>cΔt' - Δx'<sup>2</sup></i>. Or if you
like, <i>X<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> will
be <i>X<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> - X<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup></i>. I'm
using the notations back and forth so you get used to writing the
space-time coordinates in two different ways. So, it not only works for
coordinates, but for coordinate differences. You understand? Two events
occur, one here now and one there later; let's say they are separated
in time by two meters. They are separated in space by two meters and
time by 11 seconds. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to write this. I meant to
write <i>ΔX<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - ΔX<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> =
ΔX<sub>0</sub>'<sup>2</sup> - ΔX<sub>1</sub>'<sup>2</sup></i>. So, do
you guys follow the meaning of this statement? Most things are
relative. Distance between events -- relative. Time interval between
events -- relative. But this combination is somehow invariant.
Everybody agrees on what it is.</p>

<p>Now, we are going to understand the space-time interval.
<i>Δs<sup>2</sup></i> is a name for a small or a space-time interval
formed under differences. Now, we are going to apply this to the
following problem. I'm going to give you a feeling for what space-time
interval means when applied to the study of a single particle. So
previously, <i>Δx</i> and <i>Δt</i> were separations between two
random, unrelated events or arbitrary events. But now I want you to
consider the following event. Here is a particle in space-time. And it
moves there. This is where it is in the beginning, that's where it is
at the end. So now, I want <i>Δx</i> to be the distance the particle
travels. And I want <i>Δt</i> to be the time in which it did this. So,
these are two events in the life of a particle. Two events lying on the
trajectory of a particle. In the <i>x,t</i> plane, you draw a line,
it's a trajectory, because at every time, there's an <i>x</i>, and that
describes particle motion. And this is the <i>Δx</i> and this is the
<i>Δt</i>.</p>

<p>Let's look at the space-time interval between the two events.
<i>Δs<sup>2</sup></i> will be <i>cΔt<sup>2</sup> - Δx<sup>2</sup></i>.
But we're going to rewrite this as follows. Equal to
c<i>CΔt<sup>2</sup>[</i>1 <i>- (v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i> where
<i>v</i> is <i>Δx/Δt</i>. Because these are two events in the life of a
particle, the distance over time is actually the velocity of the
particle. I have always used <i>v</i> for the velocity of a particle
that I'm looking at, and <i>u</i> for the velocity difference between
my frame of reference and your frame of reference. So, <i>u</i> is
always the speed between frames. And <i>v</i> is the speed of some
particle I'm looking at. So, let's take the square root of both sides,
and we find <i>Δs = cΔt√[</i>1 <i>- (v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>.
So, the space-time interval between two events in the life of a
particle is <i>c</i> times the time difference times this factor. Now,
this is supposed to be an invariant. By that I mean no matter who
calculates this space-time interval, that person is going to get the
same answer. So, let's calculate the space-time interval as computed by
the particle itself. What does the particle think happens? Well, the
particle says, in other words, you're riding with the particle. So, in
your frame of reference, for the particle, now, the time difference
between the two events--let me call this one <i>Δτ.</i> And the space
difference? What's the space difference between the two events?
Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Zero. Because as far as the
particle is concerned, I'm still here. If I'm moving, from my vantage,
my <i>x</i> coordinates, wherever I chose to put in the beginning, and
that's where it'll follow me. So the two events, particle sighted here
and particle sighted there, have different <i>x</i> coordinates for the
person to whom the particle is moving. But if you're co-moving with the
particle, then your <i>x</i> coordinate as seen by you does not change.
Therefore, <i>Δx</i> is zero. Therefore, the space-time interval would
be simply <i>cΔτ</i> where τ is the time measured by a clock going with
the particle. So, <i>Δ</i>τ is the time in particle's frame. In other
words, if the particle had its own clock, that's the time it will say
has elapsed between the two points in its trajectory. So, it's not so
hard to understand. See, I am the particle. I'm moving, looking at my
watch, and I'm saying that time will pass for me, right? One second and
two second; that's the time according to me. If you guys see me, you
will disagree with me on how far I moved and how much time it took.
That's your <i>Δx</i> and your <i>Δt</i>. But for me, there's only
<i>Δτ</i>. There's no <i>Δx</i> for me. So, the space-time interval,
when you describe particle behavior, is essentially the time elapsed
according to the particle. So, it's not hard to understand why
everybody agrees on that. See, you and I don't have to agree on how
much time elapsed between when the particle was here and when it was
there. But if we ask, how much time elapsed according to the particle,
we are all asking the same question. That's why we all get the same
answer.</p>

<p>The space-time interval is called the proper time. So, proper time
is another name for the time as measured by a clock carried with the
particle. S,o let's write it this way. The space time interval is
really <i>cΔτ</i>. And <i>Δτ</i> is also an invariant. Namely, everyone
agrees on <i>Δτ</i>. And what's the relation between <i>Δt</i> and
<i>Δτ</i>? <i>Δt</i> is the time according to any old person. And
<i>Δτ</i> is the time according to the clock. And you saw that the
space-time interval, <i>cΔτ</i> was equal to <i>Δt√[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>. So, we are going to--I'm sorry, the
<i>c</i> cancels on both sides. This is the relation. So, I will be
using the fact that <i>dτ/dt = √[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i> or <i>dt/dτ =</i> 1<i>/√[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>. In other words, the time elapsed
between two events in the life of a particle, as seen by an observer
for whom it has a velocity, compared to as seen by a clock moving with
the particle, that ratio is given by this. As the particle speeds up,
let's see if it makes sense. As <i>v</i> approaches <i>c</i>, this
number approaches zero. That means you can say it took--the particle
has been traveling for 30 hours, but with this number almost vanishing,
the particle would say, I've been traveling for a very short time.
That's the way it is. The particle will always think it took less time
to go from here to there, compared to any other observer, because the
clock runs fastest in its own rest rate. Okay.</p>

<p>Now, this is the new variable I'm going to use to develop the next
step. The next step is the following; in Newtonian mechanics, particles
have a position <i>x</i> and maybe <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>. But let me
just say <i>x.</i> Let me take one more. It had <i>x</i> and it had
<i>y</i>. And these were varying with time. Then, I formed a vector
<i>r</i>, which is <i>ix + jy</i>. And the vector is mathematically
defined as an entity with two components so that when you rotate the
axis, the components go into <i>x'</i> and <i>y'</i>, which are related
to <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, but they're <i>cos</i> and <i>sin θ</i>.
That's defined to be a vector. Now, if I went to you and said, okay,
that's one vector, the position vector. Can you point to me another
vector? Anybody know other vectors in Newtonian mechanics? Yes sir? You
don't know any other vectors in the good old mechanics days? The only
vector you've seen is position?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Velocity is one.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Very good. Yeah. That's right.
You're right. You certainly know the answers. So, you shouldn't
hesitate. So, how do you get to velocity from position?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Take the derivative.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You take the derivative. So,
you've got to ask yourself; why does the act of taking derivative off a
vector produce another vector? Well, what's the derivative? You change
the guy by some <i>Δ</i>, and you divide it by the time. Now, change in
the vector is obviously a vector, because difference of two vectors is
a vector. Dividing by time is like multiplying by the reciprocal of the
time. That's like multiplying by number. And I've told you multiplying
a vector by a number also gives you a vector; maybe longer or shorter.
Therefore, <i>Δr</i> is a vector because it's the difference of
<i>r</i> later minus <i>r</i> now, dividing by <i>Δt</i> is the same as
multiplying by 10,000 or 100,000 or 1 million. It doesn't matter.
That's also a vector. And the limit is also a vector. Therefore, when
you take a derivative of a vector, you get a vector. And then you
can--Once you got this derivative, it becomes addictive. You can take
second derivatives. As you said, you can have acceleration. Then you
can get--you can take the acceleration, multiply a mass by a mass.</p>

<p>Now, that is called a scalar. The mass of particle is a number that
everyone will agree on. It has no direction. So, the product of a
number and a vector is another vector, and that vector, of course, is
the force. So derivatives of vectors and multiples of vectors by
scalars, namely things that don't change when you rotate your axis, are
ways to generate vectors. So what I want to do is, I want to generate
more vectors. The only four-vector I have is the position four-vector,
which is this guy, <i>X</i>, whose components I write for you again are
<i>X<sub>0</sub></i>, which is code name for <i>ct</i> and
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i>, which is code name for <i>x</i>. And you can put
the other components if you like. Now, take this <i>X</i> to be the
coordinate in space time of an object that's moving. I want to take the
derivative of that to get myself something I could call the velocity
vector in relativity. But the derivative cannot be the time derivative.
You guys have to understand that if I take these things--Of course in
space-time, the particle is moving. I can certainly tell you where it
is at one time and where it is a little later. And I can take time
derivative. But the time derivative of a vector in fourth dimension is
not a vector, because time is like any other component, you know? It's
like taking the <i>y</i> derivative of <i>x.</i> That doesn't give you
a vector. You've got to take a derivative with respect to somebody that
does not transform, that does not change from one observer to the
other. So, do you have any idea where I'm going with this? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Space-time.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. Or you can take derivative
with respect to the time as measured by the clock which is moving with
the particle. So, you can take the <i>τ</i> derivative. In other words,
let the particle move by some amount <i>ΔX</i>, namely
<i>ΔX<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>ΔX<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>ΔX<sub>2</sub></i>,
etcetera. That difference will also transform like a vector. We have
seen many, many times differences as coordinates and they transform
like a vector. Divide it by this guy, now, which is the time according
to a clock moving with the particle. Everybody agrees on that, because
we're not asking how much time elapsed according to you or according to
me. We are going to quarrel about that indefinitely. We are asking, how
much time passed according to the particle itself? So, no matter who
computes the time, you will get the same answer, and that's what you
want to divide it by. So, I'm going to form a new quantity called
velocity, which is the derivative of this with respect to <i>τ</i>. And
I'm going to use the chain rule and write it as <i>dx/dt(dt/dτ)</i>.
That becomes then 1<i>/[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]dX<sub>0/</sub>dtdx<sub>1</sub>/dtdx<sub>2</sub>/dt…</i></p>

<p>So, you find the rate of change as measured by a clock moving with
the particle. And that has the virtue that what you get out of this
process will also be a four-vector. By that I mean, its four components
will transform when you go to a moving frame just like the four
components of <i>X</i>. You remember when you took <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> and you rotated the axis, <i>x'</i> is <i>x cos τ</i> plus
<i>y sin</i> and so on. But if you take time derivatives, you'll find
the <i>x</i> component of the velocity, in the rotated frame related to
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in the old frame by the same cosines and the
same sines, because the act of taking derivatives doesn't change the
way the object transforms. So, this is my new four-vector. In fact, let
me put the third guy too; <i>dX<sub>3</sub>/dt</i>. So, what I did was
I took the <i>τ</i> derivative for which we don't have good intuition
and ordered in terms of a <i>t</i> derivative, for which we have a good
intuition. Because no matter how much Einstein tells you about space
and time, we think of time as different from space. So, we'll think of
time in terms of derivatives. But to form a four-dimensional vector,
it's not enough to do that. That's what I'm saying. Every term there is
divided by this, because that's the way of rewriting <i>d</i> by
<i>dτ</i> as <i>d</i> by <i>dt</i> times this factor. So now, I am
ready to define what I'm going to call momentum in relativity. It's
going to be called the four-momentum. Everything is the four something.
The four-vector position, this is called the four-velocity. Now, I'm
going to define something called the four-momentum. The four-momentum
is going to be the mass of a particle when it's sitting at rest.
Multiply it by this velocity. So, what is it going to be? Let me write
it out. What is <i>dX<sub>0</sub>/dt</i>? You guys remember
<i>X<sub>0</sub> = ct</i>. Sorry?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> <i>X<sub>0</sub> = ct</i> and
<i>dX<sub>0</sub>/dt</i> will be equal to <i>c</i>. You're right. If
that's what you were saying, I agree with you. Yes. So, this is a
vector, <i>m<sub>0</sub>c/[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>. Then the other guy, other
component, let me write simply as <i>m<sub>0</sub></i> times the
familiar velocity times <i>[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>. If you wanted to keep the <i>x,
y</i>, and <i>z</i> velocities, you can keep them as a vector. Or, if
you just wanted to live in two dimensions, one space and one time, drop
the arrow<i>.</i> So, we have manufactured now a new beast. It's got
four components. What is it? I modeled it after the old momentum. I
took the mass and I multiplied it by what's going to pass for velocity
in my new world. And I got this creature with four parts. You've got to
understand what the four parts mean. It's got a part that looks like an
ordinary vector. And it's got a part, there's no vectors in it.
Completely an analogy with the fact that <i>X</i> had a part that
looked like a vector in the three spatial components and a part that in
the old days was called a scalar, because it didn't transform. But of
course, in the new world, everything got mixed up. We got to know who
this is and we have to know who this is. So, I want to show you what
they are.</p>

<p>So, here is my new four-vector; <i>m<sub>0</sub>c/[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)</i>. And <i>m<sub>0</sub>v</i>, let me
drop the other components except this in the <i>x</i> direction. I may
not worry about that now. I wrote that because I want to be able to
call it a four-vector. It's crazy to call this a four-vector. I should
call it a two-vector. You guys have already seen two vectors. Well, you
have seen two-vectors in the <i>x,y</i> plane. This is a two-vector in
space-time. Or, it's part of this big four-component object. It's a
four-vector in four dimensional space-time. So, we have created
something, and we're trying to understand what we have created. So, let
me look at this guy first. This guy looks like <i>m<sub>0</sub>v</i>
divided by this factor. I don't know what it stands for, but I say,
well, relativistic physics should reduce the Newtonian physics when I
look at slowly moving objects because we know Newton was perfectly
right when he studied slowly moving objects. If I go to a slowly moving
object, so <i>v/c</i> becomes negligible, I drop that, and that becomes
<i>mv</i>; I know that's the old momentum. So, this guy is just the old
momentum properly corrected for relativistic theory. So, this quantity
here deserves to be called momentum <i>p</i>; you can put an arrow on
it, if you want, to keep the <i>p</i> component or don't put an arrow
so that of the four vector--the three components are just momentum, but
not defined in the old way. It's not <i>m<sub>0</sub>v</i>. It's
<i>m<sub>0</sub></i> divided by this. So, the momentum of a particle is
very interesting in relativity, even though nothing can go faster than
light, that doesn't mean the momentum has an upper limit at
<i>m<sub>0</sub>c</i>, because the momentum is not mass times velocity;
it's mass divided by this crazy factor. So, as you approach the speed
of light, as <i>v</i> approaches <i>c</i>, the denominator is very
close to zero, this number can become as big as you like.</p>

<p>So, why are people building bigger and bigger accelerators? If you
ask them how fast is a particle moving, for everybody in Fermilab, in
Surin it's all close to the velocity of light. It's 99.9999, other
person has a few more nines. Nothing is impressive when you look at
velocity. But when you look at the momentum, it makes a big difference
how much of the one you have subtracted on the bottom. If you've only
got a difference in the 19th decimal place, well, you've got a huge
momentum. So, particles have limited velocity in relativity, but
unlimited momentum. It also means, to speed up this particle is going
to take more and more force as it picks up speed. In other words,
you'll be pushing it like crazy. It won't pick up speed, but its
momentum will be going up. It'll pick up speed, but this pickup in
speed will be imperceptible because in the 19th decimal place of
<i>v/c</i>, it'll go from 99999 to something near the end. The last
digit will change. But the momentum will change a lot. But I don't want
to stop before looking at this guy.</p>

<p>So, we don't know who this is. So, we take this thing, this is a
zero component of <i>p</i>. Just like I called it <i>X<sub>0</sub></i>
in the old days, I'm going to call it <i>P<sub>0</sub></i>.
<i>P<sub>0</sub></i> was <i>m<sub>0</sub>c/[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]</i>. So, I don't know what to make of
this guy either. If I put <i>v =</i> 0, I get <i>m<sub>0</sub>c</i>.
That looks like the mass of a particle, but I have no idea. Okay, so
it's the mass of a particle. See here, when I put <i>v =</i> 0 on the
bottom, because the top had a <i>v</i>, not <i>v/c</i>, something was
left over that looked like something familiar, namely momentum. Here,
if I take <i>v =</i> 0 too quickly, what's left over is nothing
reminiscent of anything in Newtonian mechanics. So, you want to go in
what's called the next order in <i>v/c</i>. You don't want to totally
ignore it. You want to keep the first non-zero term, so we write it as
<i>m<sub>0</sub>c[</i>1 <i>-
(v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)]<sup>-1/2</sup>.</i> I've just written it
with a thing upstairs for the - ½ as the exponent. Then, I remind you
of the good old formula: 1 <i>+ x<sup>n</sup> =</i> 1 <i>+ nx</i>
plus<i>--</i>if <i>x</i> is very small. So, if you use that, you get
<i>m<sub>0</sub>c[</i>1 <i>+ (v<sup>2</sup>/2c<sup>2</sup>)</i> plus
higher powers of <i>v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>.</i></p>

<p>So, what are these terms coming out? Well, there's the first term,
for which I have absolutely no intuition. The second term looks like ½
<i>(mv)<sup>2</sup>/c</i>. So, for the first time, I see something
familiar. I see the good old kinetic energy, but not quite, because I
have this number <i>c</i> here. So, I decided maybe I shouldn't look at
<i>P<sub>0</sub></i>, but I should look at <i>cP<sub>0</sub></i>. Maybe
that looks something more familiar. That looks like
<i>m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> +</i> ½ <i>(mv)<sup>2</sup></i> plus more
and more terms depending on higher and higher powers of
<i>v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup></i>. But now we know who this guy is.
This is what we used to call the kinetic energy of a particle by virtue
of its motion. As the particle picks up speed, the kinetic energy
itself receives more connections because the other terms with more and
more powers of <i>v/c</i> are not negligible. You've got to put them
back in. Basically, you have to compute this object exactly. But at low
velocities, this is the main term. So, this is what led Einstein and
mainly him to realize that this quantity is talking about the energy of
an object. This is certainly energy recognized. I can put it to good
use, right? You run windmills and so on with kinetic energy, or
hydroelectric power is from channeling kinetic energy of water into
work. So, you figure this is also part of the energy.</p>

<p>So, the first conclusion of Einstein was, even a particle that's
non-moving seems to have an energy, and that's called the rest energy.
If the particle is moving, then go back to the derivation and you can
find <i>cP<sub>0</sub> = m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup></i> over this
thing. This is the full expression for the energy of a moving particle.
Not the approximate one, but if you keep the whole thing, this is what
you get. So, this says when a particle moves, it's got an energy that
looks like some velocity depending on <i>mc<sup>2</sup></i>. And when
the particle is at rest, it has got that energy, and that's the origin
of the big formula relating energy and mass. So, it leaves open the
possibility that even a particle at rest; you think when a particle is
at rest, you have squeezed everything you can get out of the particle,
right? What more can it do for you? It gave it all it's got and it's
stopped. But according to Einstein, there is a lot of fun left. We can
do something more if there's a way to destroy this. So, in his theory,
it doesn't tell you how you should do that. But it did point out that
if you can get rid of the mass, because it was energy, some other form
of energy must take its place by the law of conservation of energy.</p>

<p>So, that's how all the nuclear reactions work. In nuclear reactions,
you can take two parts, like two hydrogen atoms, hydrogen nuclei. You
can fuse them into helium and you will find the helium's mass is less
than the mass of the two parts. So, there is some energy missing. Some
mass missing; that means there's some energy is missing. That's the
energy released in fusion. Or you can take uranium nucleus and give it
a tap and break it up into barium and krypton and some neutrons. And
you will find the fragments together have a mass less than the paired.
And the missing mass times <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> is the energy of the
reaction that comes out in the kinetic energy of the fast moving
particles. So, Einstein is wrongly called the father of the bomb,
because this is as far as he went. Didn't specify how to extract energy
from mass, but showed very clearly that rest energy--that a particle at
rest seems to have a term that should be called energy because this guy
certainly is. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Will be 3/8
<i>m<sub>0</sub>(v<sup>4</sup>/c<sup>4</sup>)</i>. I don't carry more
terms in my head, but frankly, you won't need it.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> There are more corrections to
kinetic energy. In other words, why is this an important concept? If
two particles collide, we believe energy is conserved. So, you want to
add the energy before and compare it to energy after. If you want them
to perfectly match, if you stop here, your book keeping will not work.
Before will not equal after. You've got to keep all this infinite
number of terms to get it exactly right. But if you're satisfied to one
part in a million or something, maybe that's as many terms as are
needed. And at very low velocities, you don't even need that because
this is never changing in a collision. Every particle has a rest mass.
This is what we balanced when we collided. Remember, we collided blocks
and we balanced the kinetic energy? Actually, that energy is there in
every block, but it is not changing. It is canceling out in the before
and after. So, unless the two blocks annihilated and disappeared, then
you would really have something interesting. But you don't have that in
the Newtonian physics. Okay.</p>

<p>So, I should tell you that I've given you guys two more problems,
one of which is optional. You don't have to do that, but it's a very
interesting problem. And I want you to think about it because it's a
problem whether there's two rockets headed towards each other, both of
the same length; say one meter. And this guy thinks he is at rest, and
the second rocket is zooming past him like this. When the tail of this
rocket passes the tip of this, he sends out a little torpedo aimed at
this one. Clearly, it doesn't do any harm. But look at it from the
point of view of this person. This person says, "Well, I'm a big
rocket. I'm moving like this, and when my tail met the tip of this
rocket, he sent out an explosive, which certainly hit me down here."
So, the question is, "Does this upper rocket get attacked?" Does it get
hit by the lower one or not? From one point of view, you miss. The
other point of view, when you expand this one and shrink this one, you
definitely got hit. So, you've got to ask, I mean, do you get hit or
don't get hit? You cannot have two answers to one question. So, I've
given the problem. I've given you a lot of terms, and I think even
though it's optional, if you do that problem, you've got nothing to
fear. Okay? It'll give you good practice in how to think clearly about
any number of these problems. And I've given you enough hints on how to
do that.</p>
