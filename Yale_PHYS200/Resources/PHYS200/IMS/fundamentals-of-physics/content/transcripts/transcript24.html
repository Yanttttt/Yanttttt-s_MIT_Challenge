<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay let's begin the final round
of talks on the subject. Okay, what I did last time was describe to you
a certain heat engine called the Carnot engine. So, let me refresh your
memory on what that was. The whole engine consisted of a gas at some
pressure and some volume. And the gas was subject to a cycle, and the
cycle went like this. You start at some point <i>A</i>, you expand at a
certain temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, isothermally, until you come
to point <i>B</i>. So, the way you should imagine that is that this gas
is placed on a reservoir whose temperature is frozen, I mean stuck at
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. Reservoirs never change the temperature. And what
you do is you lift one grain after another of sand, so you let the gas
expand, but you don't let it cool down. The minute it tries to cool
some heat will go from below to maintain the temperature and start at
that volume and end at that volume. During this process, some amount of
heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> enters the gas. Next thing you do, you let
the gas expand some more, but now you let it expand adiabatically.
Adiabatic means you put the whole thing in a heat insulating material,
so no heat can go in or out. Now, you can see if it expands, it's going
to have to pay for it with its own internal energy, so the temperature
will drop. So, you wait till it drops to a lower temperature
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, then you go backwards like this; that's when you
start compressing the gas by putting some grains of sand back, but this
time the gas is kept in a lower temperature on top of a temperature
reservoir <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, and you drop more sand on it to
compress it, that is this part. During this portion, heat will actually
be rejected by the gas.</p>

<p>Why is heat rejected? Because normally, when you compress a gas,
you're doing work on it, the energy should go up, the energy goes up,
the temperature should go up; but you're not letting the temperature go
up, you're forcing it to have the temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. So,
it will reject heat into this heat bath. And finally, you come back to
the starting point by further compression, but adiabatic, and adiabatic
means it's insulated from the outside world; no heat flow.</p>

<p>So, there are four parts. There are two things you have to notice
about the Carnot engine. In fact, let me draw a schematic of the Carnot
engine. This is the standard way people draw that. The engine takes
some heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> from the furnace at
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, it has some <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> rejected at the
exhaust, which is at <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> and it delivers a certain
amount of work which, by the Law of Conservation of Energy, has to be
<i>Q<sub>1</sub> - Q<sub>2</sub></i>. Do you understand that? The work
done by the gas equal to that. And who paid for it? It is the
reservoir, upper reservoir furnished the heat, some heat was rejected
downstairs and the difference between the two is the work.</p>

<p>Now, we call this a cyclic process because at the end of the day,
the gases come back to where it is. That's very important, if you want
to make an engine, it's not enough to convert; the whole purpose of
heat engines was to burn something and get some work out of it. But you
don't want it to be a one shot thing. You want to be able to do it over
and over and over again and you can do that with this engine because
after the cycle, it's back to where it started and you can do this any
number of times.</p>

<p>Now, we define an efficiency for this engine, which is what you get
divided by what you pay for. What you get from the engine is of course,
the work <i>W</i> and what you pay for is the coal that you burn which
is <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. Now, writing <i>W</i> as <i>Q<sub>1</sub> -
Q<sub>2</sub></i> you can write this as 1 minus <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. This is true for any engine. Any engine,
even if it's not a Carnot engine; with the Law of Conservation of
Energy you can write something like this. Anyway, let me say with the
Carnot engine I got this as the efficiency.</p>

<p>Now, why is the efficiency not 100%? That's because
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> is not zero. You can say why are we building a
stupid engine that rejects some heat? Why not just use all of it in
some other fashion, and that's what we're going to talk about, but
assuming that the engine operates between two temperatures, the furnace
temperature and the ambient atmospheric temperature, you can calculate
the efficiency for this engine by actually calculating
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. That's a simple problem
of integrating the work done and going from here to here. Do you
remember that? 1 - <i>nRT<sub>1</sub></i> <i>log V<sub>B</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>A</sub></i> and downstairs you have <i>NR T<sub>2</sub> log
V<sub>C</sub></i> over <i>V<sub>D</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Again, you've got to remember why that is true. When you go from
<i>A</i> to <i>B</i> there is no change in internal energy because
temperature is the same. Therefore, the work done and the heat import
are equal numerically, so <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> is the work done and
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> is the work done there. So, that's what I got.
Then, I did a little bit of calculation to show you by using the fact
that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are on an adiabatic curve, <i>A</i> and
<i>D</i> are on an adiabatic curve, that these logs actually cancel,
these guys of course, cancel to give the final result 1 minus
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. That's the bottom line.
I don't care what else you remember but this is something I need for
today's discussion. Efficiency of the Carnot engine is 1 minus
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Okay now, you can say why I'd be interested in this very primitive
engine containing a cylinder and gas and so on. Okay, this efficiency
of this stupid engine, I'm sure people can build a better engine. So,
here is Carnot's claim. Mr. Carnot say,s "No engine can beat my
engine." Okay that's his claim. By "beat my engine" he means, no engine
can be more efficient than my engine. And he's going to demonstrate
that. I'm going to demonstrate that for you. You don't get something
for nothing. It's based on the following postulate, which I told you
last time. I'm just now going to write it; I will repeat it. We are
going to postulate, as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, that it's
impossible to find a process, the sole result of which is to transfer
some heat from a cold body to a hot body. We all know you can transfer
heat from a cold body to a hot body in a refrigerator. You take heat
out of the freezer and dump it into the room; no one says that's wrong.
But that's not the sole effect, because you get an electric bill at the
end of the month, because there's a compressor doing a lot of work. The
claim is--not--no other agency in the end should be affected in any
fashion. If at the end of the day all you had was heat flow up hill.
That's not allowed; that's a postulate and you have to grant him that
postulate which we accept to be phenomenologically valid. But taking
that postulate, Carnot will now show you that no engine can beat his
engine.</p>

<p>The key to the whole Carnot engine is that it is a reversible
engine. By reversible engine I mean on every step in the Carnot cycle,
let's say going from here to here, I can also go backwards. I can put a
grain of sand and compress a piston, or I can take a grain it'll go
back to where it was. You're never far from equilibrium and if you can
go one way you can go the other way. That also means the Carnot engine,
starting at the point <i>A</i>, can go backwards to <i>D</i> then
<i>C</i> then to <i>B</i> and then to <i>A</i>. If the Carnot engine
went backwards it would look like this: it will take heat
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>--I'm sorry it will take heat <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>,
somebody will give it work <i>W</i> and it'll reject
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> at this temperature. This is the Carnot
refrigerator and that's the Carnot engine. The Carnot engine and the
refrigerator are the same machine; you just can make it run one-way or
the opposite way. That's what we're going to use.</p>

<p>So, let me give you a demonstration that's for--as far as I can tell
is good enough for our present purpose, that you cannot beat the Carnot
engine. So, let us say a Carnot engine takes some heat, say 100
calories, delivers 20 calories in work, rejects 80 calories is
operating between some two temperatures <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. This is the Carnot. I am taking a particular
example where the efficiency is what, one-fifth. But don't worry about
the fact that, yeah, so it's one-fifth, so one minus
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> should be one-fifth.
Now, if you say you have a better engine, you have a better efficiency.
What you really mean is that your engine can take a 100 calories and
deliver more than 20 calories, maybe even deliver 40 calories and
reject only 60 calories, but it's also operating between the same two
temperatures. So, this is your engine. <i>U</i> for--no, <i>Y</i> for
your engine, okay; your engine is better than Carnot's engine, okay
that's your claim. You're now going to get shot down.</p>

<p>So, how am I going to shoot this down? I am going to run the Carnot
engine backwards first thing, then I am going to get a Carnot engine
which is twice as big as this Carnot engine, it's not more efficient,
it has just got twice as much gas. If you take a Carnot engine and do
the following things, run it backwards and make it twice as big. What
will that Carnot engine do? It will look like this; it will take up 160
calories from downstairs, it will want 40 calories input and it'll dump
200 calories upstairs. So, this is a two-times Carnot; let me put a
star saying it's Carnot run backwards.</p>

<p>See, it doesn't take any special genius to make an engine bigger. It
won't be more efficient; it'll have the same efficiency. But if you can
build something with one piston, I can make the same design with a
bigger piston or smaller piston. I'm just saying I want it to be twice
as big for the following simple reason. Your engine's giving out 40
units of work; my refrigerator needs 40 to run. So, what we do is we
directly take the output from your engine and feed it to my
refrigerator.</p>

<p>Okay, your heat engine makes work, my refrigerator needs work and
I've scaled mine so that its appetite matches your output; that's all
I've done. Now, let's draw a box around these guys, don't look under
the hood and see what you've got. At the end of a full cycle, when
everything is done, all the gases, all the pistons, everything has come
back to where it starts. But, no need to plug this gadget into the
wall. You don't have to plug this into anything because this
refrigerator is getting the power from this heat engine, so it doesn't
need external power. I look at the lower reservoir; I see 100 calories
leaving. You see that 60 coming down and 160 going up? I look at the
upper reservoir; I see 200 calories out, in and 100 out, so basically,
the combined gadgets, yours and mine are equal to this gadget. It
simply transfers heat from a cold body to hot body with no other
changes anywhere in the universe, and that is not allowed. Therefore,
you cannot have an engine more efficient that the Carnot engine. The
logic is pretty simple.</p>

<p>These numbers picked are representative, but you can take any number
as long as your engine does better than mine, instead of 40 calories,
would have made 30 calories needed. If it produced 30, I'll get an
engine which is one-half times as bigger than the standard engine; run
it backwards, your 30 will feed my engine and you will find once again
heat is flowing from a cold body to hot body with no other changes
anywhere in the universe, that is forbidden by the postulate. So, this
is how Carnot's engine, even though it's a very primitive engine, is
the standard for all engines. No engine can be better than the Carnot
engine. Now, the key to the Carnot engine is that it's a reversible
engine. If I had more time I could show you that all reversible engines
operating between two temperatures will have the same efficiency,
namely that of the Carnot engine.</p>

<p>Okay, now what has the Carnot engine got to do with what I started
saying earlier? You remember I started saying earlier there are certain
things in our world that seem allowed but don't seem to happen. Like
you know, drop an egg it doesn't come back in your hand. You let the
weight go down and turn the paddle. The paddle doesn't turn backwards
and lift the weight. I said many things are forbidden and there is a
law that's going to forbid all of them, so I am coming to that law. But
it all started with a person asking a very practical question, "How
good can I make engines?" And what Carnot is telling you is the best
efficiency any engine can have is this. Therefore, even today hundreds
of years after Carnot, no company in America or Japan, China, anywhere
can build an internal combustion engine for example, whose efficiency's
better than this one. It's a theoretical maximum. In reality,
efficiency will be less than this because most engines have a loss;
there is heat leaking, there is friction that's good for nothing, so in
the end efficiency will be always lower than this.</p>

<p>Okay now, let me leave the practical domain and go to more
theoretical issues that follow from this. What I want you to notice if
the following: for a Carnot engine <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> turned out to be <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Right, I did that for you here. Therefore, I am
going to write it as follows: <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> minus <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> equal to zero. That's just a simple rewrite. But I
am going to write this in another rotation. My cycle had four parts;
remember, I did this, then I did this, then I did this, then I did
that. In this segment I had <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. In this segment there was no <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>
or <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, there was no <i>Q</i>, because this is the
adiabatic process. In this segment, I had minus <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> and the last segment I had zero and whole
thing is zero. In other words, what I'm telling you is the following.
At every stage, if you looked at the heat absorbed by the system, in
stage <i>i</i>, divided by the temperature of stage <i>i</i> and you
added all of them you get zero. My process had four stages. Stage 1 is
here, stage 2 is adiabatic, state 3 is this, and stage 4 is zero again.
In this summation <i>Q<sub>i</sub></i> is defined to be
<i>∆Q<sub>i</sub></i> is the heat input in stage <i>i</i> in the cycle,
or in the process. So, we define <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> to be positive,
even though it was rejected by the engine, but in this summation, the
agreement I make is <i>∆Q</i> is positive if the heat comes into the
system, <i>∆Q</i> is negative if heat leaves the system. So, why is
that important?</p>

<p>Now, this is the heart of the whole entropy concept. Remember I told
you there is nothing called the heat in a system. You cannot look at a
gas and say that's the amount of heat in the system. Why? Because if
you take a point there and say there's some amount of heat in the
system, if you go through some kind of cycle and come back to the same
point, then since you come back to the same point internal energy
doesn't change, this is the work done, therefore, the work done is
equal to the heat and it is not zero. So, in this example what would've
happened is you'd added heat <i>Q</i> to the system. So, if there is
some notion of how much heat is there in the beginning, you got that
plus the <i>Q</i> that you added and yet you are back to where you are.
Therefore, you cannot define something and say that's the amount of
<i>Q</i> in the system because you're able to add <i>Q</i> to the
system and bring it back to where it is. What happened, of course, is
you added <i>Q</i> and you did some work. But the point is you cannot
say the <i>Q</i> here is so and so. But you can say the energy here is
so and so. Because if you come back to the same point <i>P</i> times
<i>V</i> is equal to 3 is equal to <i>RT</i> and the internal energy of
a gas is proportional to the <i>T</i>, energy returns to the old value.
But now I'm going to tell you so listen very carefully.</p>

<p>Energy is a state variable because it comes to the starting value,
if you come to the starting point. It doesn't matter where you wander
off in the <i>PV</i> diagram. Heat is not a state variable, there's
nothing called a heat at that point, because I am able to go on a loop,
change the value of <i>Q</i> or add some <i>Q</i> to it, and I come to
the same point. So, there's no unique <i>Q</i> associated with that
point.</p>

<p>But there is a new unique quantity <i>S</i>, called entropy, which
has a fixed value at a given point and if you go for a little loop in
the <i>PV</i> diagram and you come to the same point, <i>S</i> will
return to the starting value. So, who is this <i>S</i>? That <i>S</i>
is defined by saying the change in the entropy is the heat you add
divided by the temperature. In a tiny little process, if you are at
some temperature <i>T</i>, you add a little amount of <i>Q</i>, keep
track of all the changes, and that change will be zero, as I showed you
in this Carnot cycle. You can show more generally that if you take any
path, not just the Carnot engine bounded by adiabatic and isothermals,
but any path you take, you can show that the <i>∆Q</i> added up is not
zero, but <i>∆Q/T</i>, namely give a weighting factor of 1/<i>T</i> to
the heat you add, then the positives and negatives cancel and give you
exactly zero. In other words, <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> was not
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> is bigger than
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, but <i>Q<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub></i> precisely
balances <i>Q<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>2</sub></i>. The heat absorbed at
higher temperature if divided by <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, to compute the
change in entropy, then in the upper part of the Carnot cycle here, and
the lower part of the Carnot here; the two cancel as far as the entropy
change is concerned. So, entropy is a new variable; it's a
mathematically discovered variable. What we find is that if I postulate
there's a variable called entropy, the change in which, in any process,
is the heat transfer divided by temperature, then that has the property
that when you go around on a loop you come back net zero change. That
means every point can be associated with a number you can call
entropy.</p>

<p>Entropy is like a height. Suppose you are walking around on some
landscape, each point is a height. You can walk here and there and come
back at every stage; you keep track of the change in height if you come
back to where you are, the change in height will add up to zero. That's
what I told you in the case of a potential energy function. It is just
like a potential energy function. Internal energy and the entropy are
now state variables. At every point the gas has a certain internal
energy and an entropy. They deserve to be called state variables
because when you go on a loop and come back they return to the starting
values.</p>

<p>Now, you have no idea what this quantity stands for; you agree it's
bizarre. Work done, we understand. Heat absorbed and heat rejected we
understand. What is <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>? Why is dividing by
<i>T</i> make such a big difference? Why does it produce a new
variable? We can see it is true; at least in the Carnot cycle you can
verify in detail that the change in the total of all the <i>∆Q</i>s
over <i>T</i> is in fact zero. So, we'll develop up a feeling for what
it means, but historically this is what happened. People realized, hey
there's another state variable. We introduce this new variable, we have
no idea what it means but it is a state variable so we'd better take it
very seriously.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to tell you what it means. But first I want you to get
some practice calculating the entropy change for a couple of processes.
So, let us take for example, one gram of water, let's say <i>m</i>
grams of some substance. It's got some specific heat <i>C</i>. And I'll
change the temperature say from some <i>T</i> initial for some <i>T</i>
final. I do that by keeping the system--starting the system at
<i>T<sub>i</sub></i> and I should never be far from equilibrium. That's
one of the conditions on this. In fact, you can say it should be near,
always near equilibrium. So, the system starts at temperature
<i>T<sub>i</sub></i>, I put it on a heat bath, which is infinitesimally
warmer than this and I let it heat up at that point. Then, I put it on
another reservoir, slightly hotter than this one. At all stages I want
the system to be almost near equilibrium. In the sense of calculus you
can make the difference as small as you like provided you do enough
number of times and slowly I raise this guy from here to here. At every
stage the system has a well-defined temperature, has a well-defined
heat input and I wanted to add it all up. So, what's the change in
entropy? <i>S</i> final minus <i>S</i> initial is equal to <i>dQ</i>
over <i>T</i>, summed over all the parts, I should write this as an
integral, mC ∆T over T. Do you see that, dQ is mC ∆T? But I got to
divide by <i>T</i> and that integral is done between some initial and
final temperature and we can do this integral rather trivially in an
<i>mC log T</i> final over <i>T</i> initial. That is the increase in
entropy of some <i>m</i> grams of some substance of specific heat
<i>C</i> that's heated from <i>T</i> initial to <i>T</i> final.</p>

<p>We're just getting practice calculating this. We still don't know
what this guy means. So, don't worry about that right now. If it did
not divide by <i>T</i>, what are you calculating? <i>mC ∆T</i>
integrated is just <i>mC</i> times change in temperature. That's the
old calorimetric problem you did. How many calories does it take to
raise the substance from initial to final temperature? That you
understand. When you divide by <i>T</i>, something you don't
understand, but anyway, let's make sure we know how to calculate the
increase in entropy when water or something is heated from a lower to
higher temperature. If you cooled it from a higher to lower
temperature, you can use the same formula <i>T<sub>f</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>i</sub></i>, but <i>T<sub>f</sub></i> will now be smaller than
<i>T<sub>i</sub></i>; if you cooled it, if the log of a number less
than one is negative and the entropy changes it'll be negative.</p>

<p>So, let me do one more entropy calculation that's going to be pretty
important for us. That entropy calculation is this. Take a gas and
watch it expand isothermally from some starting point, at some fixed
temperature <i>T</i> that goes from <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. What is the change in entropy when it goes from
here to here? Again, the system must always be in equilibrium or near
equilibrium so I can plot it as a point in the <i>PV</i> diagram, so I
slowly take grain after grain, do the whole thing I told you, and find
<i>S<sub>2</sub> - S<sub>1</sub></i>, this is 2 and this is 1. That is
equal to the sum of all the heat transfers divided by temperature at
every little step of the way. But remember this is also the same as
<i>P∆V</i> over <i>T</i>. Why? Because on an isothermal <i>∆U</i> is
zero, I repeated it many times but you've got to know this, <i>∆Q</i>
is <i>P∆V</i>. But <i>P</i> over <i>T</i> is <i>nRT</i> over <i>V</i>,
<i>∆V</i>. You also want to divide it by a <i>T</i>. Do you understand
<i>P</i> over <i>T</i> is <i>nR</i> over <i>V</i>? So, <i>P = nRT</i>
over <i>V</i>, I'm just saying, <i>PV</i> is n<i>RT</i>, so <i>P</i>
over <i>T</i> is <i>NR</i> over <i>V</i>. Now, <i>dV</i> over <i>V</i>
when you sum or integrate will give you <i>nR log V<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. That is the change in entropy of this gas
when it went from volume <i>V</i> and went to volume
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i>, at a given temperature.</p>

<p>You don't have to use calculus to do this. Does everybody understand
why this could have been done a lot easier? You don't need to do the
integral here. Because I showed you in studying the heat engine that
the heat transfer <i>Q</i> is <i>nRT log V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. Since the whole process takes place at fixed
temperature, instead of dividing by <i>T</i> at every step, you can
just divide by <i>T</i> overall. Just bring the <i>T</i> here; that's
why this is a change in entropy. In other words, during the whole
process you feel at one temperature then integral of <i>∆Q</i> over
<i>T</i> is just 1 over <i>T</i> times integral of <i>∆Q</i>, which is
the total heat transfer. Anyway, this is the heat, this is the change
in entropy, <i>S<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>S<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>nR log
V<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Okay, so what have I done so far? Let's collect our thoughts here. I
went to the Carnot engine today and reminded you what the efficiency of
the Carnot engine was. Then, I showed you no engine can be better than
the Carnot engine. That's a separate story. That has to do with how
efficient things can be. Then, a byproduct of the Carnot engine was
this great realization that if you go on a closed loop and at every
stage you add, you compute the heat absorbed, but divide by the
temperature at that point, the sum of all those is zero. What that
means is that, there is a quantity <i>S</i> whose change, if it is
defined to be <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>, has a property the total change
in <i>S</i> is zero and you go around a loop. That means at every point
you can associate an <i>S</i>. <i>S</i> is a property of the point.</p>

<p>Another example--so then, I said let's get used to computing change
in entropy. I took one example of heating a substance of some mass and
specific heat <i>C</i> by a temperature <i>dT</i> and the change in
entropy was <i>mC log TF</i> over <i>TI</i>. You got the log because of
integral of <i>dT</i> over <i>T</i> was logarithm. Then, I took an
ideal gas, I let it expand isothermally, I found the entropy change, I
got this answer. By the way, here's an interesting exercise, I don't
have time to do it, but you can ask the following question. If you tell
me that every point there is a unique entropy, then the entropy
difference between 2 and 1 should be independent of how I go from 1 to
2. Do you understand? If you're walking on a mountain, you take two
points, they have a height difference, and I can find the height
difference by going on this path keeping track of the change in height
or any other path. In the end, the height difference between two points
is the height difference. So, I could find the entropy another way. Let
me show you another way that's easy for you guys to work out. Come down
like this and go to the right like this. And find the entropy change.
You'll get the same answer as I got on this thing.</p>

<p>Okay, it's too tempting for me to just leave it here. Let me tell
you how it works. Call this intermediate point, give a subscript zero
for all its parameters. Then in this step, when you come from here to
here, the entropy change will be--let's take one mole of a gas when I
go from here to here. Then for one mole of a gas the heat transfer
<i>dQ</i> is <i>C<sub>V</sub>dT</i> and I divide by <i>T</i> and I do
the integral from <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> to this point
<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>. That's the entropy change here. Then in the
horizontal part, since I'm going at constant pressure, I go
<i>C<sub>P</sub>dT</i> over <i>T</i> from <i>T<sub>0</sub></i> up to
back to <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, because this <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> are the same temperature. I have to add all these
to get the entropy change. Now it's a two-step process, you come down
because you're at constant volume and you're doing something to the
gas, <i>dQ</i> is <i>C<sub>V</sub>dT</i>. Horizontally, you're at
constant pressure, <i>dQ</i> is <i>C<sub>P</sub>dT</i>. That's the
definition of specific heat at constant volume, constant pressure. But
notice the following: <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> is equal to
<i>C<sub>V</sub></i> + <i>R</i>. So, put <i>C<sub>V</sub> + R</i> here
and look what you get, then you get <i>C<sub>V</sub></i> times <i>log
T<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> plus <i>log</i>
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>, which we can write as
the product here, plus <i>R</i> <i>log T<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>.</p>

<p>In other words, this log is log of <i>T<sub>0</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, the next log is log of <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>log A</i> plus <i>log B</i> is log of
<i>AB</i>. But when you do this look what happens here. This all
cancels, log of 1 is zero; the total entropy change is <i>R log
T<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>. But for a gas at constant
pressure, using <i>PV = RT</i>, this ratio of temperature is also the
ratio of the volumes. So this one--I'm sorry I should write it more
carefully. When I say <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> I really meant the
temperature at this point, second point. So, that temperature, or this
temperature is also that volume divided by the initial volume, which is
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. See, this is a confusing problem because
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> happens to be <i>T<sub>0</sub></i>. The correct
way to do this for me would be to write <i>T<sub>0</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> times <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>T<sub>0</sub></i>, then realize the fact that <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>
and <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> are equal because I am on an isotherm. That's
what I should have done. So, I should cancel this factor because
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> is <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, but here
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>0</sub></i> is <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, which is <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. That's, of course, the entropy change I got in
one shot here. So, you can find entropy change anyway you like. You
usually pick the easiest path.</p>

<p>Alright, so we have now learned how to find entropy change. We have
no idea what it means. It seems as if when you heat something entropy
goes up; when you cool something entropy goes down. That's certainly
correct, because <i>∆Q</i> is positive for heating and you divide by
<i>T</i>, and you make it a logarithm, but we know at every
infinitesimal portion we're adding positive numbers. And when I cooled
things it goes down. Why not just call it temperature? Why do you need
this new concept called entropy? So, that's what the rest of the
lecture is about. It's a very, very powerful and beautiful concept so I
wanted to explain it, make sure I get it right.</p>

<p>Here is now the result for all this hard work. Remember I told you
there are many, many, many phenomena that seem forbidden in our world,
and we're not quite sure what law to invoke to prevent all of them from
happening. Do we want a law for each one that says if you drop a bottle
and it shatters it won't come back? If you drop an egg it won't come
back. If you let hot and cold mix, they're not going to unmix. Or if
you let a gas trapped in half a room, escape to the whole room, it'll
never untrap and go back to half the room. A lot of things happen one
way but not the other and I said I am looking for a mega law that will
prevent all these things from happening. Now, I'm ready to state that
law.</p>

<p>This is the third law--I mean, the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Carnot said it one way, but I'm going to say it in a way that's very,
very general. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says <i>∆S</i> for the
universe is either zero or positive. There you have it, that's the
great law. The law says, take any process, if at the end of the process
the entropy of the universe is bigger than it was before, that will
happen. If the entropy of the universe is smaller than it was before,
it will not happen. Now, we have to make sure that this law has
anything whatsoever to do with all the other things we have studied and
I will show you; this will forbid everything that should be forbidden
and allow everything that should be allowed.</p>

<p>So, let me start with the most obvious formulation. Mr. Carnot's
version of the Second Law was that you cannot have a process in which
some heat <i>Q</i> goes from a hot body to a cold body. I'm sorry this
allowed, right, according to Carnot, this is not allowed. Right, heat
can flow downhill, cannot flow up hill. Let's see the entropy change
the universe with the two cases. In this case, with this guy, the
change in entropy is the following: the upper reservoir lost some
amount <i>Q</i>, so <i>∆Q</i> is a negative number, add some
temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, the lower reservoir gained <i>Q</i>
at temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Now, what's the overall sign of
this? Think about it. <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is bigger than
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, so this negative number is smaller than this
positive number, so the whole thing is positive. That means it's
allowed; it's okay. By the same token, if you take this process when
heat flows up hill, then this reservoir loses some heat <i>Q</i> at
temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, the other one gains heat <i>Q</i> at
temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, but this is clearly less than zero
because this positive number is smaller than this negative number.</p>

<p>So, there you have a very simple example where if heat flows the
wrong way, the entropy of the universe goes up. And it's very simple,
it's only--it's because, it's true that the heat loss of this guy is
the heat gain of that guy, that's the Law of the Conservation of
Energy. So, energy doesn't change, but entropy changes, because for
entropy it's not the heat transferred, it's heat transferred divided by
temperature. Therefore, a heat loss at one temperature and a [equal]
heat gain at a lower temperature don't cancel when it comes to entropy.
In one case the entropy goes up and is allowed; other case entropy goes
down, that's not allowed.</p>

<p>Okay so let's try, that's certainly one process that you know should
not be allowed, but it's forbidden by the Third Law, by a computation
of entropy. So, the reason when you put a hot and cold body together,
heat flows from the cold to the hot--I'm sorry from the hot to the
cold, is because that's the way the entropy will go up. So, let's take
one more example. Suppose I have some mass of water at some temperature
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and an equal mass of water at temperature
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. One is hot and one is cold. I put them together,
what will happen? We believe it will then get this big mass, all at
some common temperature <i>T</i> star which is <i>T<sub>1</sub> +
T<sub>2</sub></i>/2; this is just by symmetry. It's equal mass, equal
specific heat, where will they meet? They will meet half way. They will
meet here. Energies, of course, is conserved, and that's how we
determine in fact where they will meet. But look at the entropy. What
happens with entropy change? With entropy change, you should imagine
this water being steadily heated by putting it in contact with a lot of
reservoir, so it's never far from equilibrium and slowly bringing it to
this point. Then, the <i>∆S</i> total will be <i>M</i> specific heat is
1, then <i>∆T</i> over <i>T</i> starting from <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>T</i> star for one thing and <i>dT</i> over <i>T</i> from
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> to <i>T</i> star for the other one. Do you
understand that? They both meet at <i>T</i> star, upper limit is
<i>T</i> star, lower one is <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> for one and
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> for the other, so the change in entropy becomes
<i>M log</i> <i>T</i> star squared over
<i>T<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Now, we have to ask, okay you got an
entropy change from start to finish, but how do you know it's positive?
Can anybody give some reason why this has to be a positive without
looking into properties of logarithms and so on? Any of these in,
what--yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, that's one way to prove
that. But I am saying, I'm going to prove it to you that way. But can
you think of a reason why at every step of the process, when I brought
this down and when I pushed that up, the entropy change is always
positive in each step. So, let me explain why. Imagine cooling this
down a little bit, by putting, taking some heat <i>∆Q</i> out of this
guy. That's happening at some temperature here, this one is gaining
some <i>∆Q</i>, but at a lower temperature. Okay. Therefore, the gain
has got the same <i>∆Q</i>, but at a lower temperature, this is always
at an upper temperature. Throughout the process, at every stage, this
guy's hotter than this guy. So, every calorie of heat it gains at a
higher temperature, every calorie it loses is divided by higher
temperature, every calorie this gained is divided by lower temperature.
At every increment, at every infinitesimal step you can see the total
entropy change is positive.</p>

<p>Now, to prove it, we will do what he just said. If you want to prove
this is positive, you want to show that the fellow inside the logarithm
is bigger than 1, so I'm asking is <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> plus
<i>T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over 4 bigger than
<i>T<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i>? Or I'm saying is
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> plus <i>T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> bigger than
4<i>T<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i>? If you rearrange this, you can show
the left-hand side becomes <i>T<sub>1</sub> -
T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>; that's of course, a positive number
because this will be <i>T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> + 2<i>T<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i>.
When I bring this guy to the other side, it'll become minus
2<i>T<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i> and so it's clearly positive. So,
when hot and cold meet and create lukewarm, entropy of the universe has
gone up. It follows, therefore, if lukewarm spontaneously separated
into hot and cold, the entropy would go down and that's why that
doesn't happen. That's why if you leave a jar of water at one
temperature, it doesn't spontaneously separate into a part on top which
is cold and a part on bottom, which is hot. Such a separation would not
violate anything. It would not violate the Law of Conservation of
Energy, but it will violate the law that entropy has to always go up.
So, one way is allowed another way is not allowed. So, you see over and
over again, that anything that's allowed is in the direction of
increasing entropy; anything that is forbidden is in the direction of
decreasing entropy.</p>

<p>But who is this entropy? What does it mean? Well, that we have not
understood at all from any of these calculations. Because <i>dQ</i>
over <i>T</i> doesn't speak to us the way <i>dU</i> or <i>dQ</i> or
<i>PdV</i> does. So, that last part of what I'm going to do is going to
explain to you what is the microscopic basis of entropy. Why is the
entropy going up? Why is--why do we understand the tendency of things
to go the direction of increasing entropy? All I've shown you now is
that it's a mystical quantity called entropy, circumstantially you find
every time something is forbidden, it's because had it taken place
entropy would have gone down. Do you remember the examples? Heat
flowing from hot to cold entropy goes up, allowed. Flowing from cold to
hot, entropy goes down, not allowed. Hot and cold mix and become
lukewarm; allowed, entropy goes up. Luke warm separates into hot and
cold; not allowed, entropy goes down. So, there's definitely a
correlation. And yet we don't know what it means. So, we're going to
talk about what it means.</p>

<p>For that, I'm going to consider the following process. I take a gas
and I put it in a room in a box where there's a partition, half way.
The molecules are stuck on the left side, gas has reached equilibrium
and it's done what it can, which is to spread out over this volume.
Now, I suddenly remove the partition, rip it out. So, let's follow this
gas. Initially, it is a point here. Then, there is a period when it
goes off the radar because I told you when you suddenly remove the
wall, the gas is not in a state of equilibrium. It doesn't even have a
well-defined pressure. The minute you remove the wall, pressure is
something here, pressure is zero in the vacuum. So, you got to wait a
bit, so gas has gone off the radar. We cannot talk about what's
happening. Then, if you wait long enough, I get a gas that looks like
this after some seconds, or whatever milliseconds. That is again gas in
equilibrium. It's got a certain state; I can call it 2. What is the
entropy change now? That's what I want to ask. What's the change in
entropy here? Because I know that this is allowed, that is forbidden,
so I want to ask did the entropy go up? Now, how do we do the entropy
calculation? Here's the wrong way to do the calculation. You go back
and say <i>∆S</i> at <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>, but this whole box I
forgot to mention--I'm sorry, this whole box is thermally isolated.
It's not in contact with anything. I just ripped out the partition in
the middle; that's it. So, you might say, well, if it's thermally
isolated, <i>∆Q</i> = 0 so you can divide by <i>T</i>, you can do what
you want, so this entropy change is zero. But that is a wrong argument.
Can you think about why that's not the way to do the entropy change?
Why that's the wrong analysis? First of all, could that be the right
answer? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It can't because then that would mean that going
backwards is not a valid process.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, that is correct, but I'm
saying this computation of entropy. The one line calculation I did,
namely there is no heat inflow, the <i>∆Q</i> = 0, so <i>∆Q</i> over
<i>T</i> summed up is also zero. That's not how you do the entropy
change. Is there any condition I made on computing? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, uhm… there's a gas [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Wait in fact, here's the
interesting thing. What's going to be the temperature difference
between before and after? Which is going to be hotter or cooler? Any
views on this? Yep.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah, well, you can say it is
cooler because it was insulated and expanded, but you cool down because
you expand against an external pressure, right? If, when--If I were to
move this piston here, there is no pressure pushing this gas back. Do
you understand that? Doesn't do any work, doesn't take any heat. So,
what does that mean? In the end when you settle down, what can you
conclude? No heat input, no work done, so what does that mean in terms
of temperature?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Same.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Same. Because the internal
energy cannot change because <i>∆Q</i> = 0, work done is zero. So, in
fact, this is a surprise. This gas when it expands will be at the same
temperature. You guys are thinking of the computer air, where if you
let it expand it cools down because that is expanding against the
atmospheric pressure. This gas is expanding into a complete vacuum.
It's got no piston to push against, nothing from outside pushing, so
these two points are the same temperature. So, the correct answer,
maybe you didn't catch on, but I will tell you the correct answer is:
There is an entropy increase in this problem, because the final state
definitely has a well-defined entropy you can calculate, because it's
an equilibrium state. Initial one has a well-defined entropy, in
between stages here, are not on the <i>PV</i> diagram because they were
not equilibrium states. So in this experiment, the way to calculate the
entropy change is not to do <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i> as it happened in
this experiment. What you really want to say is my gas was here in the
beginning, my gas is there in the end, both are states of equilibrium,
both have well-defined temperature and I can find the entropy change in
going from here to here for any process I want. As long as that process
keeps the system near equilibrium, so I can follow dot by dot where I'm
moving and add the <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>s. The correct rule for
entropy change is <i>∆Q/T</i> computed on a path in which the system
never strays from equilibrium. Now, your system strayed from
equilibrium all the time. But we're not interested in how it got from
here to here. We are saying what's the entropy here and what's the
entropy here. Since this at the same temperature, I know one way to go
from there to there is to follow the isotherm because that'll connect
the two points in this particular problem. Then I know the entropy
change is <i>S<sub>2</sub> - S<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>nR log
V<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, here is the subtle point I want to explain to you. This is worth
understanding. A lot of people do all the problems and get everything
right, but don't appreciate this particular question. The free
expansion of a gas into a vacuum takes it from one equilibrium state
called 1 to another equilibrium state called 2. In the actual
expansion, the system went through a stage which cannot be even shown
in the <i>PV</i> diagram, they were not equilibrium states, they didn't
have well defined pressure, didn't have well defined temperature. How
do you find a temperature when half the box is empty? Doesn't have it,
you cannot it <i>T</i> temperature of the gas. So, what do you mean by
<i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>, there is no <i>T</i>. Only when it settles
down, there is a <i>T</i>. Every settled down equilibrium state is a
well-defined entropy. What we're trying to do is to compute that
difference. The way to compute the difference is to forget about what
actually happened and instead do the following. Take the gas like that
and turn it this way, [90 degree rotation] if you like. Just for
convenience, put a piston there at the halfway point, put some weights
on it so that the pressure equals the pressure inside and slowly remove
little by little, and keeping it on a reservoir a temperature
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. Which is the temperature at which all of this
happens, or at some temperature <i>T</i>. As you remove the grain of
sand, what happens is the gas gets some energy, that's the <i>∆Q</i>
over <i>T</i>, the reservoir loses some heat; in fact, the reservoir
loses the same amount of heat <i>∆Q</i> at the same temperature
<i>T</i>. So in fact, what happens in this process is entropy of the
universe does not change at all. The entropy gain of the gas; this is
an entropy loss of the reservoir. But I used this as a device for
finding the entropy gain of the gas in the other process.</p>

<p>So, this is the part that is absolutely central to this whole
argument how entropy is calculated. In a real spontaneous expansion of
a gas, where there was no reservoir, no nothing, we just broke the
partition and expanded, there is a change in entropy. That's an
irreversible process. But to find the change in entropy in this
problem, since 1 and 2 have well-defined entropies, we can find the
change between 1 and 2 by going to a different experiment in which it
was brought from 1 to 2, not in this crazy irreversible way, but by
putting it in contact with the heat bath at that temperature <i>T</i>,
removing grain after grain, never straying far from equilibrium, that's
when we find this change. So, you replace the dotted line, where you
cannot compute anything, by a solid line where you can. But since the
change in entropy between 1 and 2 doesn't depend on how you got there,
that's the answer. But this process, where you can actually see it is
the one in which <i>∆S</i> of the universe is actually at zero. Why?
Because you are putting in contact with the reservoir at the same
temperature, so <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i> for the gas and <i>∆Q</i> over
<i>T</i> for the reservoir exactly cancel because they're at the same
temperature and <i>∆Q</i> for one is minus <i>∆Q</i> for the other.</p>

<p>So, don't confuse the two processes. One is a reversible process in
which a gas is slowly allowed to expand from the initial state of the
final stage by removing grain after grain of some externally applied
pressure in a process where the entropy of the universe doesn't change,
gas and reservoir change by equal amounts. But the punch line is I
don't care what happens in reservoir, I want to know how much the gas
gained, because that is the gain I need to find <i>S<sub>2</sub> -
S<sub>1</sub></i> for this process.</p>

<p>So, this is how we always find entropy change. In real life
processes happen in a way in which entropy of the universe goes up.
Because take this box, in the real experiment, remember there is no
reservoir, there's only the box of gas. It expanded, its entropy went
up, so entropy of the universe actually went up. That's why it's
allowed. The entropy of the universe went up by an amount equal to the
increase in entropy of the gas when it goes from 1 to 2. To find the
increase in entropy of the gas when it goes from 1 to 2, I create a
second process in which I can compute the change by letting it go in a
sequence of connected dots and finding the change. So, the way you use
to find the change in entropy is not the way the entropy increase took
place in the real process. So, I don't think I want to repeat it
anymore, but it's an important point and you should really think about
that. Alright, now the last point is, what does--Let's analyze this
final formula I got for entropy change for free expansion of a gas.
Let's take a simple case where the gas expanded from some volume
<i>V</i> to volume 2 times <i>V</i>. What is <i>S<sub>2</sub> -
S<sub>1</sub></i>? <i>S<sub>2</sub> - S<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>nR log</i>
2. 2 happens to be <i>V<sub>2</sub>/V<sub>1</sub></i>; the volume is
doubled. Let me re-write this as <i>Nk log</i> 2, because the number of
moles times <i>R</i> is the number of molecules times <i>k</i>. Let me
re-write that as log of 2 to the <i>N</i> times <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>Now, I will tell you what all these factors mean and that comes from
the following. Thermodynamics only told you the formula for the change
in the entropy of a gas, didn't tell you what the entropy itself is.
So, the formula for the entropy of a gas, without talking about the
change and also this formula <i>∆S</i> is <i>∆Q</i> over <i>T</i>,
doesn't even believe in atoms. You don't need atoms, you don't need
molecules, you don't need to know what anything is made up of. In fact,
it was discovered long before atoms were proven to exist. Boltzmann is
the guy who gave the formula for what the entropy of a gas is in terms
of what the individual molecules are doing. That's the punch line of
what's called statistical mechanics, which gives you the microscopic
origin of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics to this stage talk about
fluids and solids and gases and nothing there requires that everything
be made up of atoms, you don't have to know what it's made of. But if
you tell me it's made up of atoms, you have a better idea of what
entropy means and here is Boltzmann's formula for entropy.</p>

<p>I am going to write it down. Boltzmann constant times <i>log Ω</i>.
I'll tell you what omega is in a minute. This is such an important
formula it is written in Boltzmann's tombstone. So, when physicists go
to Vienna, we skip the orchestras and everything else, we go to
Boltzmann's tomb and we read this formula once more with some passion.
That's a summary of a lifetime of work. But it's a great formula and
you will understand once you know the formula what all this means. So,
let me tell you what omega means. I am going to say it in words and
then I am going to apply it to this problem.</p>

<p>If you took any gas, let it be under certain conditions that
macroscopically has some pressure and some volume and so on. So, here
is the gas at one instant; now we believe in atoms, here are these
atoms scattered all over the place. Suppose I wait a little bit, what
did the gas look like? It looks like that. If you can see every atom,
the atomic configuration has changed. But macroscopically nothing has
changed. Instead of atom <i>A</i> being here, maybe <i>A</i> has gone
there and <i>B</i> has come here. In particular, if you divide the
volume into some number of little cells that you can count, on the
average the gas' uniform density, there are some number of atoms, per
every little cube you can form, a little later I move on and somebody
else moves in. Macroscopically, it looks the same to me.
Microscopically, stuff is going on.</p>

<p>Omega is the number of different microscopic arrangements that agree
with what is seen macroscopically. When I say microscopic arrangements,
I really mean the following: give every molecule a name, <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, whatever. Then put <i>A</i> here and
<i>B</i> here, <i>C</i> here and <i>D</i> there; that's one
arrangement. Then permute them, put <i>D</i> here and <i>B</i> here and
<i>C</i> here and <i>A</i> there, that's another arrangement. To my
naked eye they, all look the same, but they all produce the same
macroscopic effect, but they're different microscopic arrangements. And
you're supposed to take the log of the number of these arrangements
multiply by this constant, called Boltzmann's constant, to get the
entropy of the state.</p>

<p>So, now let's apply it to this gas here. Now, the number of
microscopic arrangements, if you really want to get down to it,
requires dividing the box into tiny little cells, maybe 1 cubic
millimeter and saying how many atoms are in each region. But we're
going to do a crude calculation in which we'll only say the following:
that either a molecule is on the left or is on the right. We are saying
these are the only two positions open to the gas; left or right. Of
course, in the left, there is left corner top and left corner bottom,
but don't worry about it. Just say that only two things it can do, it
can be on the left or it can be on the right. Now, let's ask ourselves
if the gas looks like this. How many ways can it be in this
arrangement? As compared to how many ways it can be in this
arrangement? It is like the following: molecules are moving randomly, a
given molecule has got 50/50 chance of being on the left or being on
the right. You are demanding that all the <i>N</i> molecules on their
own, there's no partition now, on their own be on the left-hand side.
You can see it's like tossing a coin <i>N</i> times and wanting heads
every time. Because you want every guy in a random process to end up
picking left. So, if you want them all to be left, there's only one way
to do that, and that's like saying I tossed a million coins, I wanted
all heads. There's only one way to do that. So, that arrangement, if
you like, we will say looks like this, left, left, left, left, left;
for everybody, that's the arrangement here. Take another one where one
molecule is over here, and all the others are here on the left side.
That looks like left, left, left, right, left, left, left. But that's
one arrangement. But have I done my complete homework here? Are there
more arrangements? I want you to think about it.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] arrangements</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] arrangements.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> This is only one of the
arrangements for the molecule on the right. There's another arrangement
in which I can have the second molecule, molecule Moe or Joe or Poe,
whoever's here. You can pick them in <i>N</i> ways. Already when one is
on the left and <i>N</i> - 1 on the right, there are more ways in which
that can happen. So, your eye sees one on the right, <i>N</i> - 1 on
the left. There are <i>N</i> ways in which that can happen. It's like
saying if I toss coins, I want 1 head and 99 tails. Well, it turns out
there are a 100 ways in which it can happen, because the one head I got
could have occurred in one of the hundred different turns. Now, suppose
I want 2 heads and 98 tails, then as you know the way to do that is 100
times 99 divided by 1 times 2. These are some combinatorics you learn
in high school. So, you find that if you plot number heads over the
total number, and ask for how many ways in which that can happen, all
heads can occur in only way, every coin has to be head, 1 head less, 1
tail and 99 heads can occur in <i>N</i> ways, then it'll become more
and more and more. And you will find the 50/50 chance of half the
number of heads and half the number of tails has the biggest occurrence
rate, because that's the most number of ways to get 50/50 than anything
else. And 100 heads is as bad as 100 tails. Again, there's only one way
in which you can get all heads in one way and which you can get all
tails. But as you start scrambling them there are more and more
ways.</p>

<p>That means for the molecule, if you have a 100 molecules, the number
of states omega is largest when they're equally distributed. In fact,
as the number molecules goes from 100 to 1000 to million to
10<sup>23</sup>, this function is so sharply peaked that the
approximate formula for omega, when it's at the 50/50 thing, is in fact
2 to the <i>N</i>. Namely, all the arrangements more or less belong to
this configuration. Therefore, if you go back to the Boltzmann formula
and, wait let me keep the formula here, and look at <i>S = K log Ω,</i>
then you find <i>S<sub>1</sub></i> is when everybody is on the left,
that is <i>k log</i> 1, and <i>S<sub>2</sub></i> is 50/50 mix, half on
the left and half on the right, that entropy is <i>k log</i>
2<i><sup>N</sup></i>,. Therefore, you can see that's what I wrote down
here, <i>K log</i> 2<i><sup>N</sup></i>.</p>

<p>So, the way to understand entropy is the following. If I give you a
gas and ask, "Will they ever like to be in the left half of the box on
their own?" Of course they won't. But if you start them out that way,
you force them to be on the left they'll be on the left. The question
is if you remove the partition, what would they likely do? Unlike
coins, which once they land on the head, they have to stay on the head,
these molecules can move around. The question is if they were all left
to begin with, how long can they possibly last? If they start moving
randomly, they will always end up doing this because there are many,
many more ways to do this, than to do this. So, things go from one
arrangement, macroscopic to another one, left to their own device,
because the final state can be realized in many, many more ways than
the initial state.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you combine a hot gas and cold gas--This is hot and
this is cold, with a thermally insulating partition, then all the hots
are on the left and all the colds are on the right. If you remove the
thermal insulation, but not even remove it, just replace it by a
heat-conducting thing, eventually the temperatures would equalize. So,
what you find every time is, there's many, many ways in which you can
pack your atoms--if you put all the hot on the left and all the cold on
the right, that can be achieved in fewer ways than in which you let
them go wherever they like. [He should have said, "If you put all hot
ones on one side and cold on the other, there are fewer ways of doing
that, than if you let them go wherever they liked"]</p>

<p>So, what you find is entropy is the direct measure of how disordered
your system is. One technical measure of disorder is to ask how many
microscopic arrangements can lead to what I see, and take the log of
that number. And what you find is this has a very low entropy; this is
a very high entropy. Because this configuration--In other words, if you
took a gas in a whole room and asked will it ever go to this
configuration, there is a slight chance it will. That chance is one
part and 2<i><sup>N</sup></i>, where <i>N</i> is 10<sup>23</sup>, so
it's not something you should wait for, but it can happen. So, the
Second Law of Thermodynamics is a statistical law. Microscopically,
it's perfectly allowed for a gas, for suddenly all the gas in the whole
room to come to where I am. It's allowed but you don't hold your
breath, because that's not likely to happen. The odds for that is again
one part in 1 over 2 to some huge number. On the other hand, if in this
part of the room we release some gas, it'll very quickly spread out,
because there are more ways to do it. So, we understand completely now
why certain things occur and why they don't. Because if you took hot
water and cold water, you are separating them to fast molecules and
slow molecules, as long as they're in different insulated containers,
that's the best they can do. But if you put them in contact, so that
they no longer have to be separated, the question is will they remain
separated. It's like saying I have bunch of coins which are all left
and all right, but they're allowed to flip as a function time, but
they'll never remain that way. Okay, so what'll happen is the cold
molecules and hot will mingle, and soon the container will have cold
everywhere and hot everywhere and you will get some intermediate
temperature.</p>

<p>Or if you took two different dyes, you know water here, on top of it
you pour some red paint, they'll be initially separated after a while
they will mix, because there's no reason for the hot--for the red
molecules to stay on the top forever; they would like to occupy the
whole box and so would the colorless ones, and eventually it will
become pink. Because there's more ways to remain pink than to remain
separated. Likewise, if pink spontaneously separated into red and
colorless, that is very, very improbable, because entropy for that
state would be lower. So, you have to understand the Second Law of
Thermodynamics is saying certain things occur because if you go in that
direction you can realize that arrangement in more ways. And since
microscopic motion is random, it's like tossing coins to ask for
<i>N</i> heads many thousand times; it's like asking all the molecules
to be on the left side of the room, to ask for 50/50 head and tails, is
like asking for molecules to populate the room equally.</p>

<p>Okay, so that's called the arrow of time. But you've got to be
careful about one thing; the entropy of a part of the universe can go
down. It's just the entropy of the whole universe will not go down. So,
all of life is an example of lowering entropy because, you know, the
creation of life or the creation of tomatoes out of mud is a highly
organizing process so the entropy there is really going down. But if
you kept track of the rest of the world, you will find there's some
corresponding increase of entropy somewhere else. Or take your freezer,
you know, your refrigerator sucks heat out of your freezer, <i>∆Q</i>
over <i>T</i> for that is negative, but somewhere there's bigger heat
emitted outside from the exhaust of the refrigerator. If you took care
of all of that, entropy of the universe will go up or remain same; it
really doesn't go down.</p>
