<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: </b>All
right. Shall we begin now? So as usual, and as promised, I will tell you what
we have done so far, and that's all you really need to know, to follow what's
going to happen next. The first thing we learned is if you're studying a
particle living in one dimension, that's all I'm going to do the whole time
because it's mathematically easier and there is not many new things you gain by
going to higher dimensions. There's a particle somewhere in this
one-dimensional universe. Everything you need to know about that particle is
contained in a function called the wave function, and is denoted by the symbol &#968;.
By the way, everything I'm doing now is called kinematics. In other words,
kinematics is a study of how to describe a system completely at a given time.
For example, in classical mechanics for a single particle the complete
description of that particle is given by two things, where is it, and what its
momentum is. </p>
<p>Dynamics is the
question of how this changes with time. If you knew all you could know about
the particle now can you predict the future? By predict the future we mean can
you tell me what <i>x</i> will be at a later time and <i>p</i> will be at a
later time. That's Newtonian mechanics. So the kinematics is just how much do
you need to know at a given time, just <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>. Once you've got <i>x</i>
and <i>p</i> everything follows. As I mentioned to you, the kinetic energy,
for example, which you write as &frac12;<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>, is given just in terms
of <i>p</i>, or in higher dimensions the angular momentum is some cross product
of position and momentum, so you can get everything of interest just by giving
the position and momentum. I claim now the equivalent of this pair of numbers
in this quantum world is one function, &#968;<i>(x)</i>. So it's a lot more
information than you had in classical physics. In classical physics two
numbers tell you the whole story. Quantum theory says &#8220;give me a whole
function&#8221;, and we all know a function is really infinite amount of information
because at every point x the function has a height and you've got to give me
all that. Only then you have told me everything. </p>
<p>That's the
definition. And the point is &#968; can be real, &#968; can be complex, and sometimes &#968;
is complex. So we can ask, you've got this function, you say it tells me
everything I can know, well, what can I find out from this function? The first
thing is that if you took the absolute square of this function, that is the
probability density to find it at the point <i>x</i>. By that I mean if you
multiply both by some infinitesimal <i>&#916;x</i> that is the probability that the
particle will be between <i>x</i> and <i>x + dx</i>. That means that you take
this &#968; and you square it. So you will get something that will go to 0 here, go
up, go to zero, do something like that. This is &#968;<sup>2</sup>, and that's your
probability density and what we mean by density is, if the function <i>p(x)</i>
has an area with the <i>x</i>-axis like <i>p(x)dx</i> that's the actual
probability that if you look for this guy you'll find him or her or it in this
interval, okay? </p>
<p>So we will make the
requirement that the total probability to find it anywhere add up to 1. That
is a convention because--well, in some sense. It's up to you how you want to
define probability. You say, &quot;What are the odds I will get through this
course, 50/50?&quot; That doesn't add up to 1 that adds up to 100, but it
gives you the impression the relative odds are equal. So you can always give
odds. Jimmy the Greek may tell you something, 7 is to 4 something's going to
happen. They don't add up to 1 either. I mean, 7 divided by 11 is one thing
and 4 divided by 11 is the absolute probability. So in quantum theory the wave
function you're given need not necessarily have the property that its square
integral is 1, but you can rescale it by a suitable number, I mean, if it's not
1, but if it's 100 then you divide it by 10 and that function will have a
square integral of 1. That's the convention and it's a convenience, and I will
generally assume that we have done that. </p>
<p>And I also pointed
out to you that the function &#968; and the function 3 times &#968; stand for the same
situation in quantum mechanics. So this &#968; is not like any other &#968;. And if &#968;
is a water wave 3 inches versus 30 inches are not the same situation, they
describe completely different things. But in quantum mechanics &#968; and a
multiple of &#968; have the same physics because the same relative odds are
contained in them. So given one &#968; you're free to multiply it by any number, in
fact, real or complex and that doesn't change any prediction, so normally you
multiply it by that number which makes the square integral in all of space
equal to 1. Such a function is said to be normalized. If it's normalized the
advantage is the square directly gives you the absolute probability density and
integral of that will give you 1. That's one thing we learned. You understand
now? </p>
<p>What are the
possible functions I can ascribe with the particle? Whatever you
like within reason; it's got to be a single value and it cannot have
discontinuous jumps. Beyond that anything you write down is fine. That's like
saying what are the allowed positions, or allowed momentum for a particle in
classical mechanics? Anything, there are no restrictions except <i>x</i>
should be real and p should be real. You can do what you want. Similarly all
possible functions describe possible quantum states. It's called a quantum
state. It's this crazy situation where you don't know where it is and you give
the odds by squaring &#968;. That's called a quantum state and it's given by a
function &#968;. </p>
<p>All right, now I also
said there is one case where I know what's going on. So let me give you one
other case. Maybe I will ask you to give me one case. The particle is known
to be very close to <i>x</i> = 5 because I just saw it there and &#949; later I know
it's still got to be there because I just saw it. Now what function will
describe that situation? You guys know this. Want to guess? What will &#968; look
like so that the particle is almost certainly near <i>x</i> = 5?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yeah? Centered where?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Centered at 5.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
At 5, everybody agree with that? I mean the exact shape we don't know. Maybe
that's why you're hesitating, but here is the possible function that describes
a particle that's location isn't known to within some accuracy. So one look at
it, it tells you, &quot;Hey, this guy's close to 5.&quot; I agree that you can
put a few wiggles on it, or you can make it taller or shorter if you change the
shape a bit, but roughly speaking here is what functions, describing particles
of reasonably well know location, look like. They're centered at the point
which is the well-known location. On the other hand, I'm going to call is &#968; <i>x</i>
= 5. That is a function, and the subscript you put on the function is a name
you give the function. We don't go to a party and say, &quot;Hi, I am
human.&quot; You say, &quot;I'm so and so,&quot; because that tells you a
little more than whatever species you belong to. Similarly these are all
normalizable wave functions, but <i>x</i> = 5 is one member of the family,
which means I'm peaked at <i>x</i> = 5. </p>
<p>Another function I
mentioned is the function &#968;<i><sub>p</sub>(x)</i>. That's the function that
describes a particle of momentum <i>p</i>. We sort of inferred that by doing
the double slit experiment. That function looks like this. Some number <i>A</i>
times <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>. Now you can no longer tell me you have no
feeling for these exponentials because it's going to be all about the
exponential. I've been warning you the whole term. Get used to those complex
exponentials. It's got a real part. It's got an imaginary part, but more
natural to think of a complex number as having a modulus and a phase, and I'm
telling you it's a constant modulus. I don't know what it is. But the phase
factor should look like <i>ipx/&#8463;</i>. So if I wrote a function <i>e</i> to the
<i>i</i> times 96<i>x/&#8463;</i>, and I said, &quot;What's going on?&quot; Well,
that's a particle whose momentum is 96. So the momentum is hidden in the
function right in the exponential. It's everything <i>x</i> of the <i>i</i>,
the <i>x</i> and the <i>&#8463;</i>. Whatever is sitting there that's the momentum.
</p>
<p>I am going to study
such states pretty much all of today. So let's say someone says, &quot;Look, I
produced a particle in a state of momentum <i>p</i>. Here it is. Let's
normalize this guy.&#8221; To normalize the guy you've got to take &#968;<sup>2</sup> and
you've got to take the <i>dx</i> and you've got to get it equal to 1. If you
take the absolute square of this, <i>A </i>absolute square is some fixed
number. I hope you all know the absolute value of that is 1 because that times
its conjugate, which is <i>e<sup>&#8722;ipx/&#8463;</sup> </i>will just give you <i>e<sup>0</sup></i>
which is 1. I want 1 times <i>dx</i> over all of space to be equal to 1.
That's a hopeless task because you cannot pick an <i>A</i> to make that happen,
because all of space, the integral of <i>dx</i> over all of space is the length
of the universe you're living in, and if that's infinite no finite <i>A</i>
will do it. </p>
<p>So that poses a
mathematical challenge, and people circumvent it in many ways. One is to say,
&quot;Let's pretend our universe is large and finite.&quot; It may even be the
case because we don't know. And I'm doing quantum mechanics in which I'm
fooling around in a tiny region like atoms and molecules, and it really doesn't
matter if the universe even goes beyond this room. It goes beyond this room.
It goes beyond the planet. It goes beyond the solar system. I grant you all
that, but I say allow me to believe that if it goes sufficiently far enough
it's a closed universe. So a closed universe is like this. A closed
one-dimensional universe is a circle. In that universe if you throw a rock
it'll come back and hit you from behind. In fact you can see the back of your
head in this universe because everything goes around in a circle. All right,
so that's the world you take. </p>
<p>Now that looks kind
of artificial for the real world, which we all agree seems to be miles and
miles long, but I don't care for this purpose what <i>L</i> is as long as it's
finite. If <i>L</i> is finite, any number you like, then the &#968; of <i>p</i> of <i>x
</i>will look like 1/&#8730;<i>L</i> <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>. Do you agree? If you
take the absolute square of this you'll get a 1/<i>L</i>. This'll become 1.
The integral of 1 of <i>L</i> over the length of space is just 1. So that's
the normalized wave function. Now this is also a very realistic thing if in
practice your particle is restricted to live in a circle. Again, there are a
lot of experiments being done, including at Yale, where there's a tiny metallic
ring, a nano scale object, and the electrons are forced to lived in that ring.
So the ring has a radius and this L is just 2&Pi;<i>R</i> where <i>R</i> is the
radius. There <i>L</i> is very real. It's not something you cooked up. It's
the size of the ring, but sometimes even if you're not doing particle in a
ring, if you're doing particle in a line you just pretend that the line closes
in on itself. That if you start at the origin and you go on the two sides it
closes in. If this is <i>x</i> = 0 you go right and you go left they all meet
at the back and it's a closed ring. </p>
<p>So let's imagine what
life looks like for a particle forced to live in a ring of circumference <i>L</i>.
The normalized wave function looks like this of momentum <i>p</i>. This is 1/&#8730;<i>L
e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>. The probability to find this guy at some point <i>x</i>
which is the absolute value of &#968;<sup>2</sup> is just 1/<i>L</i>. That means
the probability is constant over the entire ring. We don't know where it is.
You can find it anywhere with equal probability. It's always true that if you
know the momentum you don't know where it is. </p>
<p>Now let's ask one
other question. Here is the circle in which I'm living. If you look at the
real part and imaginary part with their sines and cosines they kind of
oscillate. Do you understand that? When the <i>x</i> varies they oscillate.
And one requirement you make that if you go all the way around and come back
it's got to close in on itself. Because if you increase <i>x</i> from anywhere
by an amount <i>L</i>, which is going all the way around the circle, you've got
to come back to where you start. The function has to come back where you
started meaning it's a single valued function. If you say what's &#968; here you've
got to get one number. That means if you start at some point, you go on
moving, you follow the &#968;, you go all the way around and you come back you
shouldn't have a mismatch. It should agree. So the only allowed functions are
those obeying the condition &#968;<i>(x+L) </i>= &#968;<i>(x)</i>. </p>
<p>You understand that?
Take any point you like, follow the function for a distance <i>L</i>. That
means you come back and the function better come back. So a function like <i>e</i>
to the &#8722;<i>x<sup>2</sup></i> is not a good function to go around a circle and
come back. If you go in real space, if you go on all the way it doesn't come
back to where you are. So you've got the right functions which have the
property that when you add L to them you come back where you are. That's a
condition of single valuedness. So that means in this function if I take it at
some point <i>e<sup>ipx</sup> </i>at some point <i>x</i> then I add to it <i>L</i>,
namely I'm getting <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> </i>times <i>e<sup>ipL/&#8463;</sup></i>.
That has to agree with the starting value which is <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>.
In other words I'm comparing the wave function at the point <i>x</i> and the
point <i>x + L</i>. See, if your world is infinite this is <i>x</i>, this is <i>x
+ L</i>, this is <i>x + 2L</i>, they're all different points. What the
function does here has nothing to do with what it does here, but if you wrapped
out the region back into itself what it does when you go a distance <i>L</i> is
no longer independent of what it does at the starting point. It has to be the
same thing. Therefore, I'm just applying the test. I'm saying take the
function at <i>x + L</i>, factorize it this way, demand that it be equal to a
function of <i>x</i>. These cancel and you learn then that <i>e<sup>ipL/&#8463;</sup>
</i>should be 1. Now how can that be 1? Well, one way is <i>p</i> = 0, but I
hope you know that it's not the only way. Do you know how else it can be 1
should <i>p </i>be 0?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti

Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I didn't hear that, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's infinite.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I didn't hear that again.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's infinite
[inaudible].</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You still have to say it louder.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> If it is infinite
[inaudible].</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Any other answers? Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> If it's a multiple
of 2&Pi;.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Is that what you said multiple of 2&Pi;?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Good. I'm glad you didn't say it loud enough. Okay good. It's a multiple of
2&Pi; because any trigonometry function if you add 2&Pi;, or 4&Pi;, or 6&Pi; whose argument
doesn't change then you should never forget the fact that this exponential is
the sum of two trigonometric functions cosine + <i>i</i> sine, and they all
come back. Therefore, it is too strong to say <i>p </i>should be 0. <i>p </i>should
be such that <i>pL/&#8463; </i>is 2&Pi; times any integer when the integer can be 0,
plus minus 1, plus minus 2 etcetera. That means <i>p</i> has to be equal to 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L
</i>times <i>m</i> where <i>m</i> is an integer, positive, negative, 0. </p>
<p>Now this is a very
big moment in your life. Why is it a big moment? Yes? You don't know? Well
if you haven't done it before, this is the first time you're able to deduce the
quantization of a dynamical variable. This is the first time you realize this
is the quantum of quantum theory. The allowed momenta for this particle living
in there, you might think it can zip around at any speed it likes, it cannot,
especially in a ring of nano proportions these values of<i> p </i>are all
discrete. <i>p</i> times.. 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i> times 0 is here, times 1 is here,
times 2 is here, 3 is here, -1, -2. These are the only allowed values of <i>p</i>.
So that's the case of quantization, and the quantization came from demanding
that the wave function had a certain behavior that's mathematically required.
The behavior in question is single valuedness. </p>
<p>Now I can say this
in another way. Let's write the same relationship in another way. So let me
go here. So I had the allowed values of <i>p</i> are 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i> times <i>m</i>.
I can write it as <i>p</i> times <i>L</i>/2&Pi; is equal to <i>m&#8463;</i>. <i>L</i>/2&Pi;
is the radius of the circle. So I find that <i>p</i> times <i>R </i>is equal
to <i>m&#8463;</i>. You guys know what <i>p</i> times <i>R</i> is for a particle
moving in a circle at momentum <i>p</i>? What is the momentum times the radial
distance to the center?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Angular momentum.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Angular momentum. That's usually denoted by a quantity <i>L</i> in quantum
mechanics. So
angular momentum is an integral multiple of <i>&#8463;</i>. That's something you
will find even in high school people will tell you angular momentum is an
integral multiple of <i>&#8463;</i>. Where does it come from and how does it come
from quantum mechanics? Here is one simple context in which you can see the
angular momentum is quantized to these values. </p>
<p>Now what I will do
quite often is to write the state &#968; as &#968; of <i>p</i> this way, <i>e<sup>2&Pi;</sup></i>,
I'm sorry, <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>, but to remind myself that <i>p </i>is
quantized to be integer multiples of some basic quantum where the multiple is
just <i>m</i>, I may also write the very same function the &#968;&#39;s of <i>m</i> is 1/&#8730;<i>L</i>
<i>e<sup>ix/&#8463;</sup></i>, but for <i>p</i> you put the allowed value which is 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L
</i>times <i>m</i>. And what do you get? You get 1/&#8730;<i>L</i> times <i>e<sup>2&Pi;imx/L</sup></i>.
They're all oscillating exponentials, but you realize that the label <i>p</i>
and the label m are equally good. If I tell you what <i>m</i> is you know what
the momentum is because you just multiply by this number. </p>
<p>So quite often I'll
refer to this wave function by this label m which is as good as the label <i>p</i>.
The nice thing about the label <i>m</i> is that <i>m</i> ranges over all integers.
<i>p</i> is a little more complicated. <i>p</i> is also quantized, but the
allowed values are not integers, but integers times this funny number. In the
limit in which <i>L</i> is very, very large, compared to <i>&#8463;</i>, the spacing
between the allowed values becomes very, very close, and you may not even
realize that <i>p</i> is taking only discrete values. So when you do a
microscopic problem where <i>L</i> is 1 meter the spacing between one allowed <i>p</i>
and another allowed <i>p</i> will be so small you won't notice it. So even if
you lived in a real ring of circumference 1 meter the momenta that you'll find
in the particle will look like any momentum is possible. That's because the
allowed values of <i>p</i> of so densely close, packed, that you don't know
whether you've got this one, or that one or something in between because you
cannot measure it that well. So it'll smoothly go into the classical world of
all allowed momenta if <i>L </i>becomes macroscopic. And the notion of macroscopic
is &#8220; how big is big&#8221;. Well, it should be comparable to <i>&#8463;</i>. I mean, it
should be much bigger than <i>&#8463;</i> then it'll become continuous. </p>
<p>So now I'm going to
ask the following question. If I have a particle in this world, in this
one-dimensional ring and I plot the wave function, some function &#968;<i>(x)</i>,
suppose it's not one of these functions? It's not <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>.
It's some random thing I wrote here. Of course it meets itself when you go
around a circle. That's a periodic function. Be very careful. A periodic
function doesn't mean it oscillates with a period. In this case periodic means
when I go around the loop it comes back to a starting value. It doesn't do
something like this where the two don't match. That's what I mean by
periodic. It doesn't mean it's a nice oscillatory function. These guys are
periodic and oscillatory with the period. These are periodic only in the sense
that if you go around the ring you come back to the starting value of the
function. So I give you some function like this and I ask you what's going on
with this guy. What can you say about the particle? So can you tell me
anything now given this function &#968;<i>(x)</i>? Does it tell you any
information? You mean if I draw the function like that, you get no information
from it. Is that what you're saying? You must know--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You square it you
get the probability</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, look. If you knew that you've got to say that because if I think that you
didn't realize that I know we are both in serious trouble. That's correct. I
want to reinforce the notion over and over again. Wave functions should tell
you something. Square it you get the probability. If you don't square it
don't think it's the probability because it can be negative. It can even be
complex. So don't forget if you square it you get the probability. Define a
certain position. That means if you went around with this little <em>Heisenberg</em> microscope all over the ring and you catch
it and you say, &quot;Good, I found it here,&quot; and you do that many, many
times. By many, many times I mean you take a million particles in a million
rings each in exactly this quantum state and make measurements, then your
histogram will look like the square of this function. But there is more to
life than just saying, &quot;Where is the particle?,&quot; because in classical
mechanics you also ask, &quot;What is its momentum.&quot; The question I'm
asking you is, &quot;What is the momentum you will get when you measure the
momentum of a particle in this quantum state? </p>
<p>You know the answer
only on a few special cases. If by luck your function happened to look like
one of these functions--right now I've not told you what &#968; is. It's whatever
you like, but if it looked like one of these you're in good shape because then
the momentum is whatever <i>p</i> you find up here, but it may not look like
that. This guy doesn't look like that. So then the question is if you measure
momentum what answer will you get. Now that is something--anybody know what
the answer is? Now I accept your silence because you're not supposed to know
this. This is a postulate in quantum mechanics. It's not logic. It's not
mathematics. No one could have told you 300 years ago this is the right
answer. So this is another postulate just like saying, &#968;<sup>2</sup> is
probability defined at <i>x</i>. There is a new postulate. It addresses the
following question. If I shift my attention from position, to momentum, and I
ask, &quot;What are the odds for getting different answers for momentum?&quot;
That answer's actually contained in the same function &#968; of <i>x</i> in the
following fashion. </p>
<p>Take this function &#968;<i>(x)
</i>and write it as a sum over <i>p</i> of these functions, &#968;<sub>p</sub> of <i>x</i>
with some coefficient <i>A<sub>p</sub></i>. I can also write it equally well
as the same function labeled by integer m and I want to call the coefficient
m. They're exactly the same thing, <i>p</i> and <i>m</i> are synonymous. The
same function. This function is called &#968;<sub>m</sub> because they contain the
same information on the momentum. So either you can write it this way if you
want to see the momentum highlighted, or you can write the function this way if
you want to see the quantum number m highlighted, but they stand for the same
physics. If m is equal to 4 it means the cosine and the sine contained in the
complex exponential finish 4 complete oscillations as they go around the
cycle. All right, so here's what you're told. Take the arbitrary periodic
function. Write it as a sum of these functions, each of definite momentum,
with some coefficient. Then the probability that you will get a momentum <i>p</i>
when you measure it, which is the same as the probability you will get the
corresponding <i>m</i>, is nothing but the absolute square of this
coefficient. In other words, anyway, this is a postulate. Let me repeat the
postulate. Somebody gives you a function. You write the function as a sum of
all these periodic functions, each with the index <i>m</i>, multiply each with
a suitable number so that they add up to give you the function that's provided
to you. Once you've done that the coefficient squared with the particular
value <i>m</i> is the probability you will get that value for m or the
corresponding momentum. </p>
<p>So there are two
questions one can ask at this point. First question is what makes you think
that you can write any function I give you as a sum of these functions.
Realize what this means. I'm saying I can write any function as <i>e<sup>2&Pi;imx/L</sup>&#8730;L
</i>times <i>A<sub>m</sub></i>. I'm writing out this function explicitly for
you. Now that is a mathematical result I will not prove here, it's called
Fourier series and it tells you that every periodic function, namely that which
comes back to itself when you go around a period length <i>L</i>, can be
written as a sum of these periodic functions with suitably chosen
coefficients. It can always be done. That is analogous to the statement that
if you are say living in three dimensions and there is a vector <i>V</i>, and
you pick for yourself three <em>orthonormal</em><em> </em>vectors, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>
and <i>k</i>, then any vector <i>V</i> can be written as <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>
times <i>i</i> + <i>V<sub>y</sub></i> times <i>j</i>+ <i>V<sub>z</sub></i>
times <i>k</i>. In other words, I challenge you to write any arrow in three
dimensions starting from the origin and pointing in any direction of any finite
length. I'll build it up for you using some multiple of <i>i</i>, some of <i>j</i>,
and some of <i>k</i>. We know that can be done in fact. That's if you want
the technical definition of three-dimension. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> With the Fourier
case would there be one unique way of writing ________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Good point. That's correct. There will be a unique way.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> There is?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There is. You agree in three dimensions there is no other mixture except this
one. If somebody comes with the second way of writing it you can show that the
second way will coincide with the first way. So the expansion of a function,
in what are called these trigonometric or exponential functions and it's called
the Fourier series of the function, has unique coefficients. And I'll tell you
right now what the formula for the coefficient is, but first I'm telling you
that just like it's natural to build a vector out of some building blocks <i>i</i>,
<i>j</i> and <i>k</i>, it's natural to build up periodic functions with these
building blocks the &#968;<sub>m</sub>. The only difference is there you need only
three guys. Here you need an infinite number of them because a range of m goes
from minus to plus infinity, all integers. But it's still remarkable that
given all of them you can build any function you like, including this thing I
just wrote down arbitrarily, can be built. The fact that you can prove it,
that you can do it, I don't want to prove because it's kind of tricky, but I
will prove the second part of it which is given that such an expansion exists
how do I find these coefficients given a function? </p>
<p>So let's ask a
similar question in the usual case of vectors. How do I find the coefficients?
Suppose I write the vector <i>V</i> as <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> times <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>
+ <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> + <i>e<sub>3</sub></i> times <i>V<sub>3</sub></i>.
Don't worry <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>e<sub>3</sub></i>
are the usual guys, <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>i</i>, <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> is <i>j</i> and <i>e<sub>3</sub></i> is <i>k</i>. People like to do that because in
mathematics you may want to go to 96 dimensions, but we've only got 26 letters,
so if you stuck to <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> and <i>k</i> you're going to have
trouble, but with numbers you never run out of numbers. So you label all the
dimensions by some number, which in this case happens to go from 1 to 3. You
also know that these vectors <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> have some very interesting
properties, <i>i</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>i</i>is 1. That's the
same as <i>j&#8901;j</i>. That's the same as
<i>k</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>k</i>. And that <i>i</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>k</i> and <i>i</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>j</i> are 0 and so on.
Namely the dot product of one guy with himself is 1, and any one with anything
else is 0. That just tells you they all have unit length and they're mutually
perpendicular. I want to write this as <i>e<sub>i</sub>&#8901;e<sub>j</sub></i>, but this could be
1, 2 or 3. That could be 1, 2 or 3. I want to say this is equal to 1 if <i>i</i>
is equal to <i>j</i>. This is equal to 0 if <i>i</i><b> </b>is not equal to <i>j</i>.
This is a usual vector analysis. I'm just saying the dot product of basis
vectors has this property, 1 if they match, 2 if they're different, so
there's a shortcut for this and that's write the symbol <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub>.</i>
<i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i> is called <em>Kronecker</em>'s delta. </p>
<p>Kronecker's in a lot
of things, but this is one place where his name has been immortalized. He just
said instead of saying this all the time, 1 if they're equal, 0 if they're
different, why don't you call it my symbol, the Kronecker's symbol, <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i>.
It's understood that this whole thing simply says <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i>. This
is shorthand. That means if on the left hand side there are two guys with
indices <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> if the indices are equal the right hand side is
1, indices are unequal right hand side is 0. Do you understand that this gives
you the fact that each vector is of length 1 and that each is perpendicular to
the other two. </p>
<p>Now that is what we
can use now to find out. So let me write the vector <i>V</i> in this notation
as <b>e<sub>i</sub></b> times <i>V<sub>ii</sub></i> from 1 to 3. You're all
familiar with this way to write the sum? So I come with a certain vector. The
vector is not defined in any axis. It's just an arrow pointing in some
direction. It's got a magnitude and direction. And I say, &quot;Can you write
the vector in terms of <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> and <i>k</i>?&quot; And the answer
is, &quot;Yes, of course I can.&quot; So here's your vector <i>V</i>. Here
is, if you like, <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>e<sub>3</sub></i>.
The claim is some mixture of <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>3</sub></i>
will add up to this <i>V</i>. That's granted, but how much? How much <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>
do I need? How much <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> do I need? There's a very simple
trick for that. Anybody know what that trick is? You might know that trick.
You've seen it anywhere? </p>
<p>Here is the trick.
Suppose you want to find V<sub>2</sub>? You take the dot product of both these
things with <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>. Take <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> dot this, and take
dot product with <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>. What happens is you will get--the dot
product can go inside. You'll get <i>e<sub>i</sub>&#8901;e<sub>2</sub></i>times <i>V<sub>i</sub></i>
where <i>i</i> goes from 1 to 3. What is <i>e<sub>i</sub>&#8901;e<sub>2</sub></i>? <i>e<sub>i</sub>&#8901;e<sub>2</sub></i>is <i>&#948;<sub>i2</sub></i>.
That means if this index size is equal to 2 you get 1. If not equal to 0 you
strike out. You get 0. So of all the three terms in this only one will
survive. That's the one when <i>i</i> is equal to 2 in which case you will get
1. That's multiplying <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> so it'll give you <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>.
So to find the component number 3 you take the dot product of the given vector
with <i>e<sub>3</sub></i>, and that will give you, you can see, that will give
you <i>V<sub>3</sub></i> or <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> or whatever you like. </p>
<p>I'm going to use a
similar trick now in our problem. The trick I'm going to use is the
following. So the analogy is just like you had <i>V</i> = sum over <i>i</i> <i>e<sub>i</sub></i>
times <i>V<sub>i</sub></i>, I have &#968; of <i>x</i> is equal to sum over <i>m</i>
of some <i>A<sub>m</sub></i> times the function &#968;<sub>m</sub> of <i>x</i>. </p>
<p>You understand that?
&#968;<sub>m</sub> is a particular function which I don't want to write every time,
but if you insist it is 2&Pi;<i>imx/L</i> divided by &#8730;<i>L</i>. So I'm trying to
find this guy. How much is it? That's the question. Now here we had a nice
rule. The rule says <i>e<sub>i</sub>&#8901;e<sub>j</sub></i> is <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i>. That was helpful
in finding the coefficients. There's a similar rule on the right hand side
which I will show you and we can all verify it together. The claim is &#968;<sub>m</sub>&#42;<i>(x)
</i>times &#968;<sub>n</sub><i>(x) dx </i>from 0 to <i>L</i> is in fact &#948;<sub>mn</sub>.
So the basis vectors &#968;<sub>m</sub> are like <i>e<sub>i</sub></i>. The dot
product of two basis vectors being <i>&#948;<sub>ij</sub></i> is the same here, like
same integral, but one of them star times the other one is 1 if it's the same
function and 0 if it's not the same function. Let's see if this is true. If <i>m</i>
is equal to <i>n</i>, can you do this in your head? If <i>m</i> is equal to <i>n</i>
what do we have? This number times this conjugate is just 1. You just get 1/<i>L</i>.
An integral of 1/<i>L dx</i>, so if you want I will write it here, it's 2&Pi;<i>i</i>
times <i>n</i> &#8722;<i>mx/L dx </i>from 0 to <i>L</i>. Do you understand that?
You take the conjugate of the first function. That where's it's a -m here, and
take the second function which is <i>e<sup>2&Pi;in</sup></i><sup>/<i>L</i></sup>
times <i>x</i>. </p>
<p>I'll wait until you
have time to digest that. The product of &#968;<sub>m</sub>&#42; with &#968;<sub>n</sub> you
combine the two exponentials, but the thing that had <i>m</i> in it has a -<i>m</i>
here because you conjugated everything. So I'm saying, &quot;What is the
integral going to be?&quot; If <i>n</i> is equal to <i>m</i> you can see that
in your head. This is <i>e</i><sup>0</sup>. That is just 1. The integral of <i>dx</i>
is <i>L</i>. That cancels the <i>L</i>. You get 1. That's certainly true if <i>m</i>
is equal to <i>n</i>. If <i>m</i> is not equal to <i>n</i>, suppose it is 6?
It doesn't matter. This will complete 6 full oscillations in the period, the
sine and the cosine, but whenever you integrate a sine or a cosine over some
number of full periods you get 0. So this exponential, when integrated over a
full cycle, if it's got a non-zero exponent integer exponent will give you 0. </p>
<p>So you see the
remarkable similarity between usual vector analysis and these functions. This
is an arbitrary vector. This is an arbitrary function. <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>,
<i>e<sub>3</sub></i> are basis vectors; &#968;<sub>m</sub> are if you want basis
function. I can build any vector out of these unit vectors. I can build any
function out of these basis functions. </p>
<p>And finally, if I
want to find out a coefficient, what should I do? You want to find the
coefficient <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>. What did I do here to find <i>V<sub>j</sub></i>?
You take <i>V&#8901;e<sub>j</sub></i> where <i>j</i> could
be whatever number you picked. Because if you take the dot product of the two
sides when you take dot product of <i>e<sub>j</sub></i> the only term who
survives is <i>i = j</i>. That'll give you the <i>V<sub>j</sub></i>. So
similarly here I claim the following is true. If you do the integral of &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;
<i>x</i> times the given function <i>dx</i> from 0 to <i>L</i> you will get <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>.
</p>
<p>So once I show this
I'm done. Now if you don't have the stomach for this proof you don't have to
remember this proof. That's up to you. See, I don't know how much you guys
want to know. I'm trying to keep the stuff I just tell you without proof to a
minimum. I felt bad telling you that every function can be expanded this way,
but the coefficients being given by the formula is not too far away, so I want
to show you how it's done. You may not know the details why this is working,
but you should certainly know that if you want coefficient number 13 you've got
to take &#968;<sub>13</sub>&#42; and multiply with the given function and integrate. </p>
<p>That you're supposed
to know, so why does this work? So let's see what this does. We are trying to
take &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;(x). The given function looks like a sum <i>A<sub>m</sub></i>&#968;<sub>m</sub><i>(x)
dx</i> 0 to <i>L</i> summed over <i>m</i>. So this summation you see you can
bring the &#968; in here if you like. It doesn't matter. Then do the integral over
<i>x</i> then you will find this is giving me--maybe I'll write it here. That
is going to be equal to sum over <i>m</i> <i>A<sub>m</sub></i> of &#968;<sub>m</sub>
of &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42; <i>x</i> &#968;<sub>m</sub><i>(x)</i> <i>dx</i>, and that is going
to be <i>&#948;<sub>mn</sub></i>. That means I will vanish unless <i>m</i> equals <i>n</i>,
and when <i>m</i> equals <i>n</i> I will give you 1. That means the only term
that survives from all these terms is the one where <i>m</i> matches <i>n</i>,
so the thing that comes out is <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>. </p>
<p>Once again, you will
see this in my notes, but do you have any idea of what I did or where this is
going? In quantum theory if you want to know what'll happen if I measure
momentum for a particle living in a ring you have to write the given function
in terms of these special functions each item defined as a definite momentum
with suitable coefficients. </p>
<p>The rule for finding
coefficient <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> is to do this integral of &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;.
This one, this is the rule. <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> is the integral of &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;&#968;
<i>dx</i>. And once you found the coefficients for all possible<i> n</i> then
the probability that you will have some momentum corresponding to <i>m</i> is
just <i>A<sub>m</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. That is a recipe. What the recipe
tells you is if your function is made up as a special function with a definite
momentum of course you will get that momentum as the answer when you measure
it. If your function is a sum over many different momentum functions then you
can get any of the answers in the sum, but if it had a big coefficient in the
expansion is more likely to be that answer. If it had a small coefficient it's
less likely. If it had no coefficient you won't get that momentum at all.
That's like saying if you had &#968;<i>(x)</i> it's likely where it's big, unlikely
where it's small and impossible where it is 0. </p>
<p>So that's your job.
Anytime someone gives you a function you have to find these coefficients <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>
then look at them. They'll tell you what the answer is. So that's what I'm
going to do now. I'm going to take some trial functions and go through this
machinery of finding the coefficients and reading off the answers. </p>
<p>So maybe if I do an
example you'll see where this is going. So let's take an example where I'm
going to pick first of all a very benign function then maybe a more difficult
function. The function I want to pick is this. Some number <i>n</i> cosine 6&Pi;<i>x/L</i>,
somebody gives you that function. That is not a state of definite momentum
because it is not <i>e</i> to the <i>i</i> something <i>x</i>. So we already
know when you measure momentum you won't get a unique answer. You'll get many
answers, but what are the many answers? What are the many odds is what we're
asking. </p>
<p>I forgot to mention
one thing in my postulate. What I forgot to mention is that for all this to be
true it is important that the functions, the momentum functions, are all
normalized and the given function is also normalized. You should first
normalize your function then expand it in terms of these normalized functions
of definite momentum. Only then the squares of the coefficient are the
absolute probabilities. By that I mean if you do this calculation, and you
then went and added all these <i>A<sub>m</sub></i><sub> </sub>squares, you will
find amazingly it adds up to 1. Because you can show mathematically that if &#968;&#42;&#968;
<i>dx</i> is 1 then the coefficients of expansion squared will
also be 1. So if you took a normalized &#968; then the probabilities you get are
absolute probabilities because they will add up to 1. There's also a
mathematical result which I am not showing. All right, so let's go to this
problem. </p>
<p>So the first job is,
normalize your &#968;. So how to normalize this function I'm going to demand that
if you square &#968; and you integrate it, so I say <i>N<sup>2</sup></i> times
integral of cosine square as 6&Pi;<i>x/L dx</i> from 0 to <i>L</i> should be 1.
Now you don't have to look up the table of integrals because when you take a
cosine squared or a sine squared over any number of full cycles the average
value is a half. That means over the length <i>L</i> this integral will be <i>L</i>/2.
So you want <i>N<sup>2</sup>L</i>/2 to be 1 or you want n to be square root of
2/<i>L</i>. So the normalized function looks like square root of 2/<i>L</i>
cosine 6&Pi;<i>x/L</i>. </p>
<p>So that's the first
job. Second is you can ask now what are the coefficients <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>.
So <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> is going to be integral 1/&#8730;<i>L</i> <i>e</i><sup>-2&Pi;<i>inx/L</i></sup>
times this function square root of 2/<i>L</i> cosine 6&Pi;<i>x/L dx</i>. Are you
with me? That's the rule. Take the function, multiply it by &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;,
which is this guy here, this is the &#968;<sub>n</sub>&#42;, this is the &#968; that's given
to you, and you're integrating the product in the integral. </p>
<p>That'll give you <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>.
But I claim, yeah, if you want you can do this integrals, but I think there's a
quicker way to do that. Have any idea of what the quicker way just by looking
at it? In other words, if you can guess the expansion I'll say I will take
it. Can you guess what the answer looks like without doing the work? In other
words I want you to write this function as a sum over exponentials just by
looking at it. Can you tell me what it is? I want you to write it in the form
sum over <i>m</i> <i>A<sub>m</sub> e<sup>2&Pi;imx/L</sup></i>. You can find the <i>A<sub>m</sub></i>
by doing all this nasty work, but I'm saying in this problem there's a much
quicker way. You see it anywhere? What's the relation between trigonometric
functions and exponential functions? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Euler's formula?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
And what does it say?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>e<sup>ix</sup></i>
= cosine <i>x</i> + <i>i </i>sine <i>x</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, but now I want to go the other way. It is certainly true that cosine &#952;,
I'm sorry, <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup> </i>is cosine &#952; + <i>I </i>sine &#952;. I told you,
you forget the formula at your own peril. The conjugate of that is <i>e<sup>-i&#952;</sup></i>
is cosine &#952; -<i>i</i> sine &#952;. If you add these two you'll find cosine &#952; is <i>(e<sup>i&#952;</sup>
+ e<sup>-i&#952;</sup>)/</i>2, and if you subtract them and divide by 2<i>i</i>
you'll find sine &#952; is e to the minus
over 2<i>i</i>. I wanted you to be familiar with complex numbers enough so
that when you see a cosine the two exponentials jump out at you. Otherwise you
will be doing all these hard integrals that you don't have to do. That's like
saying sine squared + cosine squared is 1, but you don't look it up. That's
something you know. What you look up is your Social Security number or
mother's maiden name. You're allowed to forget those things. You look in a
book. That's the name. But this you have to know because you cannot go
anywhere without this because if you don't know it all the time you must have
done these trigonometry calculations in school. You've got to plug in the
right stuff at the right time for things to all cancel out. You cannot say,
&quot;I will look it up,&quot; because you don't know what to look up. So
everything should be in your head, and the minimum you should know is this, the
minimum. </p>
<p>Therefore, I can come
to this function here and I can write it in terms of--what I'm telling you is &#968;<i>(x)</i>,
which was given to us, is equal to the square root of 2/<i>L</i> times cosine 6&Pi;<i>x/L</i>,
but I'm going to write it as square root of 2/<i>L</i> times &frac12;<i>e<sup>6&Pi;ix/L</sup>
</i>+ <i>e<sup>-6&Pi;ix/L</sup></i>. So that I will write it very explicitly as 1/&#8730;2
times <i>e<sup>6&Pi;ix/L</sup>/&#8730;L </i>+ (1/&#8730;2)<i>e<sup>-6&Pi;ix/L</sup> </i>divided
by &#8730;<i>L</i>. In other words, what I've done is rather than doing integrals I
just massaged the given function and managed to write it as a sum over
normalized functions, as I said, with definite momentum with some
coefficients. In other words, here it is in the form that we want. <i>A<sub>m</sub>e<sup>2&Pi;imx/L</sup></i>.
You agree that I have got it to the form I want? You see that? You take the
cosine, write it as sum of exponentials, then put factors of &#8730;<i>L</i> so that
that's a normalized function, and that's a normalized function, and everybody
else is <i>A</i>. So what do you find here? What are the <i>A</i>'s for this
problem? By comparing the two what do you find are the <i>A</i>'s in this
problem? What is <i>A<sub>14</sub></i>? Let me ask you this. If you compare
this to this one what <i>m</i> are you getting? Do that in your head. If you
compare this to this one what is <i>m</i>?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> 3.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> 3.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
m is 3 for this guy, so this is really &#968;<sub>3</sub> and this is &#968;<sub>-3</sub>
because you can see there are two momenta in the problem. And you can stare at
them, you can see right away. Therefore, <i>A<sub>3</sub></i> is 1/&#8730;2, and <i>A<sub>-3</sub>
</i>is also 1/&#8730;2. Therefore, the probability for m = 3 is &frac12;, and the
probability for m = -3 is &frac12; and nothing else. All other <i>A</i>'s are 0
because they don't have a role. So you might think every term must appear. It
need not. So this is a good example that tells you only two of the m's make it
to the final summation. All the other m's are 0 and they happen to come with
equal coefficients, 1 over root 2. The square of that is 1 over 2, and you can
see these probabilities nicely add up to 1. I told you if you normalize the
initial function the probability for everything will add up to 1. </p>
<p>So this is a
particle. If a particle is in a wave function cosine 6&Pi;<i>x/L</i>, which is a
real wave function, and you can plot that guy going around the circle, it
describes a particle whose momentum, if you measure, will give you only 1 of 2
answers, <i>m</i> = 3 is <i>p</i> = <i>2&Pi;&#8463;/L </i>times 3 or - 3 plus or minus <i>6&Pi;&#8463;/L</i>.
You can see that too. I mean, just look at this function. If you call it <i>e<sup>ipx</sup>
p</i> is 6&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i>, so this particle has only two possible answers when you
measure momentum. So it is not as good as the single exponential which has
only one momentum in it. This is made up of two possible momenta, but you
won't get anything else. You will not get any other momentum if you measure
this. So if you got <i>m</i> = 14 as a momentum there's something wrong. It's
still probabilities, but it tells you that there is non-0 probability only for
these two. </p>
<p>Now in a minute I
will take on a more difficult problem where you cannot look at the answer, you
cannot look at the function &#968; and just by fiddling with it bring it to this
form. You understand? It is very fortunate for you that I gave you cosine
which is just the sum of two exponentials so the two what are called plane wave
exponentials are staring at you and you pick them up. I can write other
functions, crazy functions for which you will have to do the integral to find
the coefficient. </p>
<p>But I'm going to tell
you one other postulate of quantum mechanics. In the end I will assemble all
the postulates for you. I'm going to tell you one more postulate. It's called
the measurement postulate. The measurement postulate says that if you make a
measurement, and you found the particle to be at a certain location <i>x</i>,
then right after the measurement the wave function of the particle will be a spike
at the point <i>x</i> because you know that you found it at <i>x</i> it means
if that has any meaning at all if you repeat the measurement immediately
afterwards you've got to get the same answer. Therefore, your initial function
could have looked like that, but after the measurement it collapses to a
function at the point where you found it. This is called the collapse of the
wave function. It goes from being able to be found anywhere to being able to
be found only where you found it just now. It won't stay that way for long,
but right after measurement that's what it'll be. But the state of the system
changes following the measurement. And if you measured <i>x </i>it'll turn
into a wave function with well defined <i>x</i> which we know is a spike at <i>x</i>
equal to wherever you found it. </p>
<p>Similarly, if you
measured momentum and you found it at--if you measure momentum, first of all
you'll get only one of two answers, <i>m</i> = 3 or <i>m</i> = -3. If you got <i>m</i>
= 3 the state after the measurement will reduce to this. This guy will be
gone. This will be the state. So from being able to have two momenta which
are equal and opposite the act of measurement will force it to be one or the
other. It can give you either one, but once you've got it that's the answer.
It's like the double slit. It can be here and it can be there. It is not
anywhere in particular, but if you shine light and you catch it, right after
the measurement it is in front of one slit or the other. Think of this as
double slit. There's some probability for 3 and some for -3, but if you catch
it at 3 it'll collapse to this one. So what happens is in the sum over many
terms the answer will correspond to one of them, and whichever one you got only
that one term will remain. Everything will be deleted from the wave function.
So the act of measurement filters out from the sum, the one term corresponding
to the one answer that you got, this is called the collapse of the wave
function. </p>
<p>So in classical
mechanics when you measure the position of a particle nothing much happens. It
doesn't even know you measured it because there are ways to measure it without
affecting it in any way. So if had a momentum <i>p</i> at a position <i>x</i>
before the measurement it's the answer right after the measurement because you
can do noninvasive measurements. In quantum theory there are no such
measurements in general. In general the measurement will change the wave
function from being in one of many options to the one option you got, but the
answer depends on what you measure. With the same wave function on a ring,
let's say, if you measure position and you found it here that'll be the
answer. If you measured momentum and you got 5 it'll be something with 5
oscillations in it. So it'll collapse to that particular function and what it
collapses it depends on what you measure. And for a long time I'm going to
focus only on <i>x </i>and <i>p</i>. Of course there are other things you can
measure and I don't want to go there right now, but if you measure <i>x</i> it
collapses to a spike at that location. If you measure <i>p</i> it collapses to
the one term wherever that was, that one <i>e<sup>ipx</sup></i> in the sum. </p>
<p>So another
interesting thing is the only measurement, only answers you will get in the
measurement are the allowed values of momentum. You'll never get a momentum
that's not allowed. And once you get one of the allowed answers there are two
things I'm telling you. One is the probability you will get that answer is
proportional to the square of that coefficient in the expansion of the given
function. In our problem there are only two non-zero coefficients. Both
happen to be 1/&#8730;2. It happened to be an equal mixture, but you can easily
imagine some other problem where this is 1/&#8730;6, and something that is 1/&#8730;6, and
something that is 1/&#8730;3, they should all add up to 1 when you square and add
them. Then you can get all those answers with those probabilities. </p>
<p>So the last thing
I'm going to do is just one more example of this where you actually have to do
an integral and you cannot just read off the answer by looking at it. Then
we're done with this whole momentum thing. I will write the postulates later,
so I don't want to write it in my handwriting, but one final time. Measurement
of <i>x</i> collapses the function &#968;<i>(x) </i>to a spike at <i>x</i>.
Measurement of <i>p</i> collapses &#968; to that particular plane wave with that
particular <i>p</i> or <i>m</i> on the exponent. And after that that's what's
taken to be. </p>
<p>People always ask,
&quot;How do we know what state the quantum system is in?&quot; Who tells you
what &#968;<i>(x)</i> is? It's the act of measurement. If you measure the guy and
you found him at <i>x</i> = 5 the answer is &#968; is a big spike there. If you
measure momentum and you've got <i>m</i> = 3 the answer is that particular wave
function with 3 on the exponent. So measurements are a way to prepare states. </p>
<p>By the way, it's
very important that if you had a system like this the probability for getting a
certain <i>x</i>, say at this <i>x</i>, is proportional to the square of that
number. Once you took the state and didn't measure <i>x</i>, but measured
momentum it'll become one of these oscillatory functions with a definite
wavelength. It's a complex exponential, but I'm showing you the real part.
Now if you measure position, in fact the square of this will be flat. Remember
<i>e<sup>ipx</sup></i> is flat. So in classical mechanics if I measure
position, and I measure momentum, and I measure position again I'll keep
getting the same answers. I see where it is. I see how fast it's moving.
Again, I see where it is. If I do all of this in rapid succession you will get
the same answer <i>xp xp xp</i>. In quantum theory once you measure <i>x</i>
it'll become a big spike at that point. You can get all kinds of answers <i>p</i>.
If you measure <i>p</i> you've got an answer. That answer is a new wave
function which is completely flat. That means if you measure <i>x</i> you'll
no longer get the old <i>x</i>. In fact you can get any <i>x</i>. That's why
you can never filter out a state with well defined <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>
because states of well defined <i>x </i>are very spiky, and states of
well-defined <i>p</i> are very broad, so you cannot have it both ways. </p>
<p>And that's what I
want to show you in this final example. I'm going to take the following wave
function on this ring. The function I'm going to take is, &#968; is some <i>ne<sup>&#8722;&#945;|x|</sup></i>,
mod <i>x</i> [ <i>|x|</i> ]means this is <i>x</i> = 0. To the right it falls
exponentially and to the left it falls exponentially. Is it clear what I'm
saying here? This is my ring and I'm trying to plot the function. It is
highest at the origin and falls exponentially equally for positive and negative
<i>x</i>. So that's the meaning of mod <i>x</i>. So how far can you go before
&#968; becomes negligible? Well, that's when <i>e<sup>-x</sup></i> is a big
number. </p>
<p>So I'm going to
assume that when you go all the way around half the circle, I'm going to assume
that &#945;<i>L</i> is much bigger than 1. That means its function dies very
quickly spreading negligible beyond some distance. How far does a function
live? Roughly speaking you can go a distance <i>&#916;x</i> so that &#945; times <i>&#916;x </i>is
roughly 1. Because if you plot this exponential you ask, when does it come to
say half its value or one fourth of its value, you'll find it's some number of
order 1/&#945;. So this is a particle whose position has an uncertainty of order 1/&#945;.
So you can make it very narrow in space so you know pretty much where it is or
you can make it broad, but I want to consider only those problems, where even
if it's broad it's dead by the time you go to the other side to the back.
That's for mathematical convenience. So this is the state and I want to ask
myself any question we can ask. First question I can ask is if I look for its
position what will I find? I think we have done it many, many times. You
square the guy you get <i>n<sup>2</sup>e<sup>-2&#945;|x|</sup></i>. So that's the
shape. That shape looks the same. If you square an exponential you get
another exponential. But now let me demand that this integral <i>dx</i> be
equal to 1. </p>
<p>So what is that
integral? I hope you can see that this function is an even function of <i>x</i>
because it's mod <i>x</i>. So it's double the answer I get for positive <i>x</i>.
Oh yeah, sorry, not minus infinity. It's &#8722;<i>L/2 </i>to +<i>L/2</i>. You can
go this way <i>L/2 </i>and we can go that way <i>L/2</i>. So it's <i>n<sup>2</sup>
</i>is 2 times e to the -&#945; <i>x</i> 2&#945; <i>x dx</i>.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Should it be L over
2?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Should it be L over
2.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti

Yes, thank you. So I'm going to now assume that in the upper limit of the
integration instead of going up to <i>L/2</i> I go to infinity. It doesn't
matter because this guy is dead long before that. That's why I made that
choice. So that I'm going to write this 2 times <i>N</i><sup>2</sup> times 0
to infinity <i>e<sup>-2&#945;x</sup> dx</i>. That's a pretty trivial integral.
It's just 1/2&#945;. If you want I will write it out. It's <i>e<sup>-2&#945;x</sup>/-2&#945;
</i>from 0 to infinity. At the upper limit when you put infinity you get 0.
At the lower limit when you put x = 0 you get 1. There's a minus sign from
this and you get <i>N<sup>2</sup></i>/&#945;. It should be 1, or <i>N</i> is equal
to the &#8730;&#945;. So my normalized wave function, this is the first order of
business, is square root of <i>&#945;e<sup>&#8722;&#945;|x</sup></i><sup>|</sup>. I just
squared it and I integrated it. The only funny business I did was instead of
cutting off the upper integral at <i>L/2</i> I cut if off at infinity because <i>e<sup>&#8722;L/2</sup></i>
is <i>e</i> to the minus nine million, let's say. So I don't care if it's nine
million or infinity. To make the life simpler I just did it that way. </p>
<p>Now I want to ask
you, what is <i>A(p)</i>? <i>A(p)</i>, the coefficient of the expansion
remember is <i>e<sup>&#8722;ipx/&#8463;</sup>/&#8730;L </i>times &#968;<i>(x) dx </i>from &#8722;<i>L/2 </i>to
+<i>L/2</i>. Now I'm going to work with p rather than m. I will go back and
forth. You should use to the notion that the momentum can be either labeled by
the actual momentum or the quantum number m which tells you how much momentum
you have in multiples of 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/m</i>. So you've got to do this integral. So
let's write this integral. This looks like &#8722;<i>L/2</i> to <i>L/2</i>. In fact
I'm going to change this integral to minus infinity to plus infinity because
this function <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> </i>times <i>e<sup>&#8722;&#945;|x|</sup> dx</i>. Do
you understand that these limits can be made to be plus and minus infinity
because area under a graph that's falling so rapidly, whether it's between
minus and plus <i>L/2</i> or minus and plus infinity, is going to be the same.
It's just that this integral is so much easier to do. Now you cannot jump out
and do this integral because it's a mod <i>x</i> here. So mod <i>x</i> is not <i>x</i>,
it is <i>x</i> when it's positive and it's -<i>x</i> when it's negative. </p>
<p>So you've got to
break this integral into two parts. One part where <i>x</i> is positive from 0
to infinity, I'm sorry, I also forgot a root, &#945; and <i>A&#8730;L</i>. Do you see
that? So this is really square root of <i>&#945;/L</i> times <i>e</i><sup>-&#945;<i>x</i></sup>
e<sup>&#8722;<i>ipx/&#8463;</i></sup><i> dx </i>plus another integral from minus infinity
to 0 <i>e<sup>+&#945;x</sup> </i>times <i>e<sup>&#8722;ipx/&#8463;</sup> dx</i>. I split the
integral into two parts. So I didn't make a mistake here. This really is <i>e<sup>+&#945;x</sup>
</i>because <i>x</i> is negative. So what one does in such situations, I'm
going to do it quickly and you can go home and check it, just calculus, change
the variable from <i>x</i> to -<i>x</i> everywhere. In the terms of new
variable this will make a -<i>x</i>. That'll become +<i>x</i>. <i>dx</i>
will become minus of the new variable. The limits will be plus
infinity to 0, and you can flip that for another change of sign 0 to infinity.
So that was a very rapid slight-of-hand, but I don't want to delay that. This
is just--you go home and if you want check that if <i>x</i> goes to -<i>x</i>
you get that. </p>
<p>So you notice this
is the complex conjugate of this one. Whatever function I'm integrating here
is the conjugate of it because this is real, <i>&#945;x</i>, and -<i>ipx</i> has
become +<i>ipx</i>. So if I find the first part of the integral I just take
that times its conjugate and I'm done. </p>
<p>So what do I get for
that? I get square root of <i>&#945;/L </i>times--remember integral <i>e</i><sup>-<i>&#945;x</i></sup><i>
dx</i> from 0 to infinity is 1/&#945;, but what I have here is <i>dx e<sup>-&#945;</sup>
+ ip/&#8463; x<sub>0</sub> </i>to infinity plus the complex conjugate. Now you may
be very nervous about doing this integral with a complex number in it because
real we all know the integral is just 1/&#945; <i>e<sup>-&#945;</sup></i>. It
turns out that it's true even if it's got an imaginary part as long as you have
a positive real part. In other words, the answer here doesn't depend on this
guy being real. So it's really &#945; over <i>L</i> times 1 over &#945; + <i>ip/&#8463;</i>
plus a complex conjugate which is &#945; &#8722; <i>ip</i>/<i>&#8463;</i>. Now you should be
able to combine these two denominators and you get square root of &#945;/L divided
by &#945;<sup>2</sup> plus <i>p<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i> times 2&#945;.
Again, this is something you can go and check, but I don't want to wait until
everyone can do this thing because I want to tell you the punch line. So this
is what it looks like. <i>A(p) </i>looks like a whole bunch of numbers I'm not
going to worry about, but look at the denominator. It's &#945;<sup>2</sup> + <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>
over <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>, or if you want multiply by <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>. </p>
<p>There are some other
numbers I'm not interested in. The numbers are not important. How does it
vary with <i>p</i> is all I'm asking you to think about. I'm sorry, <i>A(p),</i>
this is just <i>A(p)</i>, but I want the <i>A(p) </i>squared that looks like
the square of this. All I want you to notice is that this function is peaked
at <i>p</i> = 0 and falls very rapidly as <i>p</i> increases. When <i>p</i> is
0 you've got the biggest height. When does it become half as big or one fourth
as big? Roughly when <i>p<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to <i>h<sup>2</sup>&#945;<sup>2</sup></i>
because that's when these numbers become comparable, therefore when <i>p</i> is
<i>&#8463;&#945;</i> this function will have a denominator which is twice what it had here
or maybe one fourth. I'm not worried about factors like 1 and 2. The point is
in momentum space, in momentum you can get all kinds of values of <i>p</i>, but
the odds decrease very rapidly for <i>p</i> bigger than <i>&#8463;&#945;</i>. So the most
likely value is 0, but that's the spread. And <i>&#916;p</i> is <i>&#8463;&#945;</i>, or  &#945; times <i>&#916;p</i> is <i>&#8463;</i>, and that is the uncertainty principle
because  &#945; is just <i>&#916;x</i>. By the way, I will publish these notes
too, so you don't have to worry if you didn't write everything down. I suggest
you--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Can you go over
again what cc is?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Complex conjugate. That's what I did. Whatever number this one is the other
guy is obtained by changing <i>i</i> to -<i>i</i>. Look, all I want you to
notice is this. I took a function whose width is roughly 1/&#945;. Then I looked
at what kind of momenta I can get. Then I find that the narrower the function bigger
the spread in the possible momenta you can get. So squeezing it in <i>x</i>
broadens it out in <i>p</i>. And that's the origin of the uncertainty principle.
It's simply a mathematical result. The functions which are narrow in <i>x</i>
have a Fourier series which is very broad in <i>p</i>. The quantum mechanics
relates <i>p</i> to momentum and therefore the uncertainty principle. So
anyway, I'll give you some homework on this, and you can also fill in the
blanks of this derivation, which I think is very useful.</p>
