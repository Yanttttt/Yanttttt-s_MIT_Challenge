<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, let's get started now. I
think last time I gave you guys really all the ammunition you need to
do most of this term, because I told you about Newton's laws, and I
said, "Well, you got Newton's laws--"</p>

<p>[Talk about the sound system]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I was just saying that I am
beginning to recognize some of you people. I would ideally like to have
a class with maybe just ten students so that we can have a lot of
dialogue and I can find out what you're thinking about, address your
questions. That'll make a lot of fun but that's not possible in an
introductory course. But I think you should feel free to interrupt or
ask questions or discuss any reasonably related issue that I didn't get
to. Okay? But that'll make it interesting for everybody because I told
you many times the subject is not new to me. It's probably--it's new to
you. So what makes it interesting for me is the fact that it's a
different class with a different set of people with different
questions. And trust me, your ability to surprise me is limitless
because even on a subject which I thought is firmly fixed in my mind,
some of you guys come up with some point of view or some question
that's always of interest to me, of people who've been practicing this
business for a long time. So I welcome that, and that'll make it more
lively.</p>

<p>All right, so I think last time I got off on a rant about all the
different pedagogical techniques, some of which I don't endorse fully.
I'm going to go back now 300 years in time, to one of the greatest laws
that we have because--look at the power of this law, right? Here is the
equation, and all the mechanical phenomena that we see, around the
world, can be understood with this law. And I was starting to give you
examples on how to put this law to work, because I think I at least
made you realize that simply writing down the law does not give you a
good feeling for how you actually use it. So, maybe you have understood
it, but I'm going to remind you one more time on how you're supposed to
use this law. So, I'm going to take a concrete example. The use of any
law of physics is to be able to predict something about the future,
given something about the present. So, all problems that we solve can
be categorized that way.</p>

<p>So I'm going to take a very simple problem, a problem to which I
will return in great detail later on; but let me first start with--let
me start with this problem, which I will do very quickly now and we'll
come back and do it more slowly later. But at least it's a concrete
problem. The problem looks like this. So, here is a table and here's a
spring and here's the mass <i>m</i>. There's a force constant <i>k</i>.
I want to pull it by some amount <i>A</i>, and let it go. So that's the
knowledge of the present. The question is, when I let it go, what's
this guy going to do? That's the typical physics problem. It can get
more and more complex. You can replace the mass by a planet; you can
replace the spring by the Sun, which is attracting the planet; you can
put many planets, you can make it more and more complicated. But they
all boil down to a similar situation. I know some information now and I
want to be able to say what'll happen next. So, here I pull the mass,
when I want <i>A</i> and I want to know what'll it do next.</p>

<p>Remember, when we go back to the laws of Newton, the laws of Newton
only tell you this--and we've been talking about this is useful
information. The first thing you have to know in order to use the laws
of Newton, you have to separately know the left-hand side. You have to
know what force is going to act on a body. You cannot simply say, "Oh,
I know the force on the body, it is <i>m</i> times <i>a</i>; <i>ma</i>
is not a force acting on a body; <i>a</i> is the response to a force;
you got to have some other means of finding the force. And in this
case, the force on the mass is due to the spring. So, I pull the spring
by various amounts and I see what force it exerts. Now, I think you
know now in practice how I know what force it exerts, right? I pull it
by some amount, attach, say, the one kilogram standard mass. I see what
acceleration it experiences, and <i>m</i> times that acceleration, or 1
times the acceleration, is the force the spring exerts. So I pull it by
various amounts and I study the spring. And I've learned, by studying
the spring, that the force it exerts is some number <i>k</i>, called a
force constant, times the amount by which I pull it. If I start off the
mass in a position where the spring is neither expanded nor contracted,
that's what we like to call <i>x</i> = 0. So I pulled it to <i>x</i> =
<i>A</i>. Now, what I'm told is when you pull it to any point <i>x</i>,
that's the force the spring exerts.</p>

<p>So, this is part of an independent study. People who work in spring
physics will study springs and they will find out from you, find out
and tell you that any time you buy a spring from me it'll exert this
force. And they have done--they figured that out by pulling the spring
and attaching it to various entities and seeing what acceleration it
produces. There, the masses are taken to be known, because you can
always borrow the mass from the Bureau of Standards, or we discussed
last time how if you have an unknown mass you can then compare it to
this mass and find out what its value is. So every object's mass can be
measured. And then the guys making the spring have studied what it does
to different masses and figured this out.</p>

<p>Now, you come with this mass and you say, what happens when I
connect it? Well, I'm assuming the mass of this guy can also be found
by comparisons, the way I described to you last time. So we can always
find a mass of any object, as we went into in some length. Then,
Newton's law says this is equal to <i>ma</i>, but I want to write
<i>a</i> as the second derivative of <i>x</i>. So, you now go from a
physical law, which is really a postulate. There is no way to derive
<i>F = ma</i>. You cannot just think about it and get it. So, whenever
I do physics I will sometimes tell you this is a law; that means don't
even try to derive it. It just summarizes everything we know in terms
of some new terms, but it cannot be deduced. On the other hand, the
fate of this mass can now be deduced by applying Newton's law to this
equation.</p>

<p>Now, this is a new equation, you may not have seen this equation
before. For example, if I told you -- forget the left-hand side -- if I
told you the right-hand side is 96, I think you guys know how to solve
that, right? You have to find a function whose second derivative is 96
divided by <i>m</i>, and you all know how to do that; it's
<i>t<sup>2</sup></i> times a number, and you can fudge the number so it
works. This is more complicated.</p>

<p>The time derivative of this unknown function is not a given number
but the unknown function itself; in other words, <i>x</i> itself is a
function of time. This is called a differential equation. A
differential equation is an equation that tells you something about an
unknown function in terms of its derivatives. You can have a
differential equation involving the second derivative or the first
derivative or the fourteenth derivative, whatever it is. You are
supposed to find out what <i>x (t)</i> is, given this information. So,
one thing is, you can go to the Math Department and say, "Hey look, I
got this equation, what's the solution?" and they will tell you.</p>

<p>Now, sometimes we have to do our own work and we can solve this
equation by guessing. In fact, the only way to solve a differential
equation is by guessing the answer; there is no other way. You can make
a lot of guesses and every time it works you keep a little table; then
you publish it, called <i>Table of Integrals</i>. So, I have in my
office a huge table, Mark Caprio has got his own integral, we don't
leave home without our <i>Table of Integrals</i>. I got one at home, I
got one at work, I may want to keep one in the car because you just
don't know when you will need an integral. Okay? So people have
tabulated them over hundreds of years. But how do they find them?
They're going to find them in the way I'm going to describe to you now.
You look at the equation and you guess the answer.</p>

<p>Let's make our life simple by taking a case where the forced
constant is just 1, okay? It takes 1 Newton per meter to stretch that
spring. I let the mass of the object be 1 kilogram. This is just to
keep the algebra simple. Later on, you can put any <i>m</i> and
<i>k</i>, and we'll do all that. Then what am I saying? I'm saying,
find me a function whose second derivative is minus that function. Now,
as a word problem maybe it rings a bell, right? Do you know such a
function?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Exponential.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Exponential is good. Another
one? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Any trig functions.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Trigonometric functions are
good. So I'm going to temporarily dismiss the exponential. I will tell
you why. An exponential function is actually a very good guess. You can
say <i>x = e<sup>t</sup></i>, for example. The trouble is, this is
growing exponentially, and we know this spring mass system, the
<i>x</i> is not growing exponentially. Or you might say, well, let me
fix that by making it minus <i>t</i>; then it quickly comes to rest
after a time and doesn't move. We sort of feel we want this thing to be
jiggling around for a long time. So, the exponential function is even
better than this function because it says, take one derivative and I
reproduce myself. But that's too much; we only want a function that
reproduces itself when you take two derivatives, and that's where the
trigonometric functions come in. So, I make a guess, <i>x (t)</i> is
<i>cos t</i>, and you can check if you take two derivatives, it obeys
the equation, the second derivative of <i>x</i> is <i>–x</i> itself.
But do I like this solution or is there something not fully
satisfactory? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> But you can't help the negative when you
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh it will be negative <i>x</i>.
So, let's do that. So let's take <i>dx/dt = -sin (t)</i>. Then, take
one more derivative, <i>d²x</i> over <i>dt²</i>, derivative of sine is
cosine. So, if this is <i>–cos (t)</i>, but <i>x</i> was <i>cos
(t)</i>; so it's really minus of the <i>x</i> I started with. Yes? So
you have a question or--?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I was thinking, you wrote it up there
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, this one?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Caught on film. Yes, that's a
mistake. Okay? That should be minus. Very good. Look, it makes me
immensely happy when you guys catch me. Of course, it becomes an
addiction, you try to catch me; sometimes it doesn't work, but keep
trying. This time you're absolutely right. That's why you were looking
confused. Anything else? Everyone follow the way this very elementary
problem is solved? It's solved by making a guess. So, you're right. So,
the minus sign was wrong but now you agree everything's working. This
is the answer. But no, I meant something else is not quite okay with
this. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Your function also works if you added a factor of
the sine, also?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. But first of all, I can add
some <i>sin (t)</i> and it'll still work. But more importantly, if I
put <i>t</i> = 0, I get <i>x</i> = 1. Why should it be true that I
pulled it by exactly one meter? I could have pulled it by 2 or 3 or 9
meters. I want to be able to tell how much I pulled it by at <i>t</i> =
0. Suppose it was pulled to 5 meters and released. I want <i>x</i> (0)
to be 5. The point is, you can easily fix that, by putting a 5 here.
Does it screw up everything? It doesn't because the 5 just comes along
for the ride, everywhere. And don't think it's 5<i>x</i>, because this
5 is part of <i>x</i>. So you can multiply your answer by any number
you like, and you pick that number, that reproduces your initial
displacement. So if you pulled it by 5, you put a 5. So, now we're very
happy to describe this problem. It is true, you can put <i>sin (t)</i>
but I will, in this problem we don't need it.</p>

<p>Here's an answer that does everything you want it to do. At the
initial time, it gives you 5 times <i>cos</i> 0, which is 5; and that's
what you told me was the initial displacement. Initial velocity, if you
take a <i>dx/dt</i>, it's proportional to <i>sin (t)</i> and a <i>t</i>
= 0, that vanishes, that's correct; you pulled it and you let it go.
So, the instant you released it, it had no velocity. And it satisfies
Newton's laws, and that's your answer. I want to do this simple example
in totality because this is the paradigm. This is the example after
which everything else is modeled. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How do you know that it's not <i>sin (t)</i> at the
end?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah. You need a <i>t</i> = 0, if
the answer was <i>sin (t)</i>; well <i>sin (t)</i> vanishes a <i>t</i>
= 0. And <i>cos (t),</i> it doesn't vanish, has a robust value of 1.
But I want a value of 5, I put a 5 in front. Look, you guys may have a
few more things to say about this problem because this is not the final
and most general solution to the problem. It is a solution that
certainly works for the one example I had, which is a mass being pulled
to 5 meters and released. So, carry this in your mind. This is really
to me the most important thing I can tell you right now. The way <i>F =
ma</i> is applied in real life is half the world is working on the
left-hand side, finding the forces that act on bodies under various
conditions. In this example, the force is due to a spring and by
playing with a spring you can study the force it exerts the various
displacements of various amounts by which you pull it, and in this
example if you pull the spring by an amount <i>x</i>, it exerts the
force <i>-kx</i>, and you can measure <i>k</i> and you put the label on
your product and you sell the spring with a given <i>k</i>. Other
people are measuring masses of various objects and they've decided the
mass of this is whatever, maybe 1 kilogram. You put the two sides
together and you find the response of the system for all future times.
And what this tells you then, you can now plot this. This is a graph
that looks like this; it goes from 5 to -5 and repeats itself and it's
very nice. That's what we think the spring would do.</p>

<p>Now, you think this is a real spring or am I missing something? This
is the whole story? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> There's friction.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> There's friction because we know
if you pull a real spring it's not going to oscillate forever. It's
going to slowly stop shaking and pretty much come to rest. That just
means--Who do you want to blame for this equation? Do we conclude now
there's something wrong with Newton's laws? Or what's the problem?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The <i>k</i> coefficients should not be
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The <i>k</i> coefficient is wrong.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> The fault is not with the
<i>k</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> We didn't take into account all the force that's
friction and the amount of force.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That is correct. So, we will say
we have missed something. There's another force acting on this mass,
besides the spring; that's the force of friction that'll oppose the
motion of the mass. So, you can say one of two things. Either you can
say something is wrong with Newton's laws, or you can say we've not
applied Newton's laws properly because we haven't identified all the
forces. So, if you never knew about friction, you do this and you find,
hey, it doesn't work. The mass comes to rest, whereas the theory says
it should oscillate forever. So, you are at the fork. Either you can
say Newton's laws are right; I'm missing some forces, I'm going to look
around and find out what they are. Then, you will derive friction from
that. Or maybe it's time to give up Newton's laws. It turns out, even
if there is no friction this is not the correct law of physics. The
correct law is given by Einstein's relativistic dynamics. This does not
satisfy the relativistic dynamics; by that I mean, if you really pull a
real mass by 5 meters or whatever and release it, its motion will not
be exactly what I said; or it'll be off by a very, very, very tiny
amount that you probably will not discover in most laboratories. But if
the mass begins to move at a velocity that is comparable to that of
light, then this equation will be wrong.</p>

<p>So, people say, oh, what kind of business are you in? Every once in
a while somebody is wrong. I'll tell you right now. Everything we know
is wrong, you know? And it's no secret; you can publish it, you can
tell the whole world, this practitioner said everything is wrong. But
it's wrong in this limited sense. Is Newton right or wrong? Well,
Newton didn't try to describe things moving at speeds comparable to
light. He dealt with what problem he could deal with at that time. So,
it's a law that has a limited domain of validity. You can always push
the frontiers of observation until you come to a situation where the
law doesn't work. But the specialty of relativity doesn't also work all
the time. If the mass becomes very tiny, it becomes of atomic
dimensions, then you need the laws of quantum mechanics. That's wrong
too. So, things work in a certain domain and sometimes you abandon the
formalism; but don't rush to do that. In this case, the problem is not
with formalism but due to friction. So, you have to make sure you got
all the forces. Once you got all the forces, it still doesn't work,
then of course the experimentalists are very happy because there's
something wrong with the theory; then you got to find the new theory,
till that works.</p>

<p>Okay, so that's the cycle. So it's an ongoing process; physics is
still a work in progress. This is work as of 300 years ago. And no
one's found anything wrong with Newton's laws, provided you don't
violate two conditions. You don't deal with objects moving at speeds
comparable to that of light, and you don't deal with objects which are
very, very tiny. The notion of what's very tiny will be very clear when
you learn quantum mechanics next term. Right now, there is something
rough, called "tiny," there's things like atomic dimensions.</p>

<p>All right. So now we are going to do more concrete problems, but I
wanted to write that up for you as a simple, solvable, worked out -- an
example that displays everything that happens in physics.</p>

<p>All right. So, by the way, people are always looking for new forces,
the electrical forces. You find a charge on a table, it's not connected
to a spring; I bring another charge next to it, in this case it starts
moving. What do I do? A body accelerating without any force… I can say
Newton is wrong or I can say maybe there's a new force between that
body and this body, and that will turn out to be the electrical
force.</p>

<p>Electrical force occurs whenever you take something, you take a cat
and you take a piece of amber or you rub it, you do various things,
then you put them next to other things and they're attracted or
repelled, and you discover you're charging things, and that's how
electricity was discovered. But you don't have to have a cat; if you
have a buffalo, you can take it with a buffalo, it still works. Then,
you got to find out what you really need to find electric forces. But
you find there is a new force and you know you've got a whole new force
to study; then you got to find out what's the cause of the force. It
turns out, it's not the mass of the object, it's something else called
electric charge. Then, how does the force vary with distance? Well, it
varies like 1/<i>r²</i>. You know that. So that's how you slowly study
and identify new forces. So, the forces were found in the order of
gravitation first, and then electricity, magnetism and now of course
there are new forces called "strong forces." There are weak forces.
They all act on the subnuclear level; so that's why that business is
not done. We are not finished with the left-hand side. We're still
looking for new forces.</p>

<p>Okay, so now I'm going to start doing problems in two dimensions.
Everything I did last time was 1D. You're pulling something, you're
pushing something, you got one block connected to a second block to a
third block and you pull it. We're done all that. So we're going to
elevate this to high dimensions. And as you know, in high dimensions,
acceleration is a vector, and so force better be a vector because when
you take a vector and multiply it by a number you get something else.
And there, by that process, you've gone to higher dimensions.</p>

<p>So let's take again simple problems and try to make them more and
more complex. And you cannot tell me eventually you agree the problem
is complex enough, or I will crank it up as we go along. If at some
point you plead for mercy, then we'll stop. But there is no limit to
how difficult mechanics problems can be. If you go back and read
Cambridge University exams, in 1600 and 1700, there were really
difficult problems. That's why they invented quantum mechanics, which
is a lot easier than those problems from Newtonian mechanics. You can
make it as hard as you like.</p>

<p>So, I'm just going to do a few, then once you got the idea, you
stop. But again, we're going to start with easy one. Easy one is a
table on which this mass is sitting, doing absolutely nothing. And we
want to study that guy and understand it in terms of Newton's laws.
Because we're in two dimensions, you got to have two axes. So here is
my <i>x</i> and here is my <i>y</i>. So, the first rule is if <i>F =
ma</i>, we're really saying <i>i</i> times <i>fx</i> + <i>j</i> times
<i>fy</i>, is <i>miax</i> + <i>mjay</i>. It's a vector equation. The
force has to be a combination of <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> because
nobody--By the way, I'm working in the <i>xy</i> plane. I told you I
don't need to go to 3D, for a long time. In 3D, in every vector there's
some amount of <i>i</i> and some amount of <i>j</i>, that's, what's
true for <i>f</i>, that's true for <i>a</i>. You write it out. And I
told you, if two vectors are equal, then the <i>x</i> components have
to match and the <i>y</i> parts also have to match. You can see that.
If I draw two arrows on the plane and I tell you this arrow is the same
as that arrow, it's the same. It's got the same horizontal part and the
same vertical part. So, this is really two equations, and I'm going to
apply them to this block.</p>

<p>So, when I look at this block, in the <i>x</i> direction, it's not
moving at all. There are no known forces acting in the <i>x</i>
direction, and therefore it's a case of 0 = 0. Did I miss something?
You guys look a little worried. Yes? Okay, now I look in the <i>y</i>
direction. If you look in the <i>y</i> direction, I take this block and
I draw its free body diagram, and I write all the forces on it. So,
there is the force of gravity, <i>mg</i>; however, this <i>M</i> is a
big <i>M</i> or a small <i>m</i>? Well, let's change the figure to
small <i>m</i>, so that the rest of the equations are right. The little
<i>mg</i> is acting down. If that's all you had, the block would fall
through the table; it's not doing that, so the table we know is
exerting a force.</p>

<p>The standard name for that is <i>N</i>, and <i>N</i> stands for
normal. And normal is a mathematical term for perpendicular. You say
this vector is normal with that vector, you mean they are
perpendicular, and here we mean this force is perpendicular to the
table. There are the forces in the <i>y</i> direction. In the <i>y</i>
direction, <i>N</i> is a positive force, it's with a plus sign;
<i>mg</i> is a negative force, and that's equal to <i>m</i> times
<i>ay</i>. It's interesting that in this application of the Newtonian
equation, I'm going to say that I know the right-hand side. I know the
right hand side is 0 because I know this block is neither sinking into
the table nor flying off the table. It's sitting on the table; it has
no velocity, it has no acceleration, vertically. So that has to be 0
because I know the right-hand side. So, in Newton's laws, quite often
either I will know the left or I will know the right; either I will
know the force or I will know the acceleration. So, if this is 0, I
come to the conclusion <i>N = mg</i>. This is a very simple example,
but this is how you figure out how the Newton's laws work in this
particular problem.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm ready to introduce another force, and that's the force
of friction. As you all seem to be aware, there is generally a force of
friction between this mass <i>m</i>, and this table. So, how do we
learn there is a force of friction? Suppose someone said, how do you
know there is friction? Here is a mass. What experiment will you do
that tells you, hey, there is another force called friction? Okay,
anybody tell me something you would do? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Maybe put the mass on an incline.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, but suppose it's on this
table. But you are around, you can do what you want. Yes? Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] constant <i>v</i>; in order to move with
a constant <i>v</i>, you'd have to apply force.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's possible.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> But moving forward, over the constant <i>v</i>,
there's no force.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's a very good answer. One
answer is, you find that to keep it moving at constant velocity, you
have to apply a force. That means the force you're applying is
cancelled by somebody else, because there is zero acceleration, there's
got to be zero force. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Just apply force to it and push it on the table and
it'll stop eventually, and that's how you think there must be a force,
that's out there.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Very good. But even before that,
even before it starts moving, you find that if you push it, it doesn't
move. Right? I try to push the podium, well, I don't know my own
strength, but I'm going to imagine, I push it, it's not moving. But if
I push hard enough it will move. What's happening before it moves? I'm
applying a force and I'm getting nothing in return for it. So I know
there is another force opposing what I do, and that's called a force of
static friction. So, static friction is when the body is not moving.
So, I'm applying a force <i>F</i>. Let me give it some other name,
little <i>f</i>. No, that's also bad. Little <i>f</i> was the name for
friction. So, I'm going to apply a force called <i>F<sub>me</sub></i>.
You can label these things any way you like. Okay? This particular
notation has not caught on because people are not as interested in what
I think as I am. But right now I'm going to call it <i>F sub-me</i>. I
invite you to invent any notation you want because there's nothing
sacred about a notation, at least I want to convey to you that notion.
So, I call it <i>F<sub>me</sub></i>, I'm applying to the right, then I
know that it's not moving; therefore, there has to be another force
that cancels it. But how much is the other force? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Equal to <i>F<sub>me</sub></i>.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's correct. So, it is not a
fixed force. Static friction is not a fixed force; it's whatever it
takes to keep it from moving. It will not be less than what I apply,
because then it'll move; it cannot be more than what I apply because
then it'll start moving backwards. So, it will do what it takes to keep
it from moving. So, static friction is a force which has a range from 0
to some maximum. So, let's call it the force of friction is less than
or equal to some maximum. And that maximum turns out to be a number
called the coefficient of static friction times the normal force. The
force of friction seems to depend on how much normal force the table is
exerting on the object, which in our example, if you want in our
example, not always, this is always true, but in our example you may
replace it by <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> times <i>mg</i>, because <i>N</i> =
<i>mg</i>. So the force of friction seems to depend on how heavy the
object is that's sitting on the table. But what does it not depend on
that it could depend on? Can you think of something else it could
depend on but doesn't? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The amount of surface area.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It doesn't depend on the area of
contact. In other words, if this was a rectangular block, it doesn't
seem to matter whether it's doing that or whether it's doing that. You
might think, hey, there's going to be more friction because there's
more contact. But it doesn't. So, it's interesting not only what it is
but what it's not. Okay, this is called a coefficient of static
friction. So you guys should remember that the force that friction
applies is equal to the force that I apply, up to a maximum of this.
And once I beat the maximum, it'll give up and it'll start moving. Once
it starts moving, you're going to have a situation like this. I apply
<i>F<sub>me</sub></i> this way, and friction will apply a force which
now is called new <i>μ sub-kinetic</i> times <i>N</i>. So, the force of
friction is different when it's moving as compared to when it's not
moving, it's slightly less, once a body is in motion. So, it's always
true for all situations; <i>μ</i> sub-kinetic is less than <i>μ</i>
sub-static.</p>

<p>Okay? So, this is how you characterize friction. You study various
objects and you find out friction certainly depends on the nature of
the two surfaces. Given that constant, it seems to depend only on the
normal force and not on the area. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So is <i>μ</i> sub-kinetic less than the maximum
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Remember, <i>μ</i> sub-kinetic
is a fixed number.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Maybe .2. <i>μ</i> sub-static is
a fixed number, .25. If it's .25 for static, it means if the normal
force is some <i>mg</i>, up to a quarter of the weight is the
frictional force it can apply to prevent its motion. Suppose I apply a
force on a body, which is originally 1/10<sup>th</sup> of its weight;
it won't move; 2/10<sup>th</sup> of its weight it won't move; a quarter
of its weight it's a tie; .26 of its weight it'll start moving. Once it
starts moving, frictional force will be .2 times its weight, not .25,
because the kinetic friction is less. This is just the summary of
friction. Okay, so far even though I used vectors, most of the action
is just in one or the other direction. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, it again seems to--It can
actually depend on many things. Friction is something we don't
understand fully. But it depends only on the normal force, just the way
I described it.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, we are going to do the one problem that has sent more
people away from physics than anything else. Do you know what it is?
You haven't heard about the problem that sends people away? Okay, this
is called the inclined plane. A lot of people may not remember where
they were during the Kennedy assassination, but they say, "I remember
the day I saw the inclined plane; that's the day I said I'm not going
into physics." Because this is very bad publicity for our field. You
come into a subject hearing about relativity and quantum mechanics and
then--or maybe gravitation and astrophysics, and we hit you with this.
So why am I doing this? Well, if you can do this and you find it
boring, you can move on. But if you couldn't do this, you have no right
to complain because this is the entry ticket into the business. You've
got to be able to do this. Only then I can tell you other things. Okay,
so we have to. We'll do this quickly. I'm watching the clock. I won't
linger over this, but we have to do this problem. Okay? So let's
quickly finish this problem.</p>

<p>So here is the problem. There is a mass, m, sitting on its inclined
plane, it'll make some angle here. You want to know what it's going to
do. All right, we know it's going to slide down the hill, but we want
to be more precise, and the whole purpose of Newton's Laws is to
quantify things for which you already have an intuition. So the only
novel thing about the inclined plane is that for the first time we are
going to pick our <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes not along the usual
directions, but along and perpendicular to the incline. That's going to
be my <i>x</i> and that's going to be my <i>y</i>. And I ask, what are
the forces on this mass? Well, I've told you, first deal with contact
forces. But the only thing in contact with the mass is the plane. The
inclined plane can exert a force, in general, along its own surface and
perpendicular to its own surface. But I'm going to take a case where
there is no friction. If there is no friction, by definition it cannot
exert a force along its own length. So it can only exert a force in
this direction and we're going to call that <i>N</i>. Then, there's
only one other force; that's the force of gravity which we agreed we
have to remember. Even though the Earth is not touching this block, the
Earth is somewhere down here, it's able to reach out and pull this
block down. So, let me show you the forces. So here is <i>N</i>, and
here is <i>mg</i>, these are your forces. And with no friction, that's
it. That's the key to doing any problem I give you, in any exam. No
matter how stressful, I guarantee you'll get it from Newton's laws,
provided you write every force that is there and don't write any force
that is not there. So, this is it. These are the two forces, and the
mass will do what these forces tell it to do.</p>

<p>So, what we want to do then, since my axes are in this direction, I
have to take this <i>mg</i> and write it as the sum of two vectors, one
which is pointing in this direction and one which is pointing in that
direction. So, if I add these two arrows, I get <i>mg</i>. That's
called resolving the force into some other direction. Now, the key to
all of this is to know that this angle, here, is the same as this angle
here. In other words, if <i>mg</i> is acting down, that angle <i>θ</i>
is the same as this angle <i>θ</i> here. This is going to be used all
the time, so I'll tell you a little trick that tells you how I figured
that out. <i>θ</i> is the angle between the horizontal and the incline.
Now, you've got to agree that if I draw perpendicular to the horizontal
and I draw perpendicular to the incline, the angle between those two
perpendiculars will be the same as the angle between the two lines I
began with, because perpendicular means rotate by 90. If you rotate
both lines by 90, the angle between the rotated lines is the same. The
vertical is perpendicular to this horizontal, and this is the
perpendicular to the plane. Once you got that, the rest is very
easy.</p>

<p>So, in the <i>x</i> direction, I'm going to write the following
equation: <i>mg</i> times <i>sin θ</i>. So, you've got to understand
that this part here will be <i>mg</i> times <i>sin θ</i>, and this part
here will be <i>mg</i> times <i>cos θ</i>. You've got--This is
something you better get really used to. If a vector is like this and
you want the force in that direction, the angle between is <i>θ</i>,
then you put the cosine. The component that's adjacent to the vector,
is the cosine, this one here is a <i>sin θ</i>. So, I got the
horizontal part in the <i>x</i> direction, I got <i>mg sin θ</i>, and
that's it. There's nothing else. That's got to be equal to <i>m</i>
times <i>ax</i>. Remember <i>ax</i> is not horizontal, <i>ax</i> is
along the incline, downhill.</p>

<p>In the <i>y</i> direction I write <i>N - mg cos θ</i> = <i>m</i>
times <i>ay</i>. That's simply writing down Newton's laws as two laws,
one along <i>x</i> and one along <i>y</i>, and putting in whatever we
know. What happens next is up to what else we know. Well, we know that
this block is sliding down the hill, it's not going into the block, nor
is it flying out of the block; it's moving along the block. That's the
reason we chose a coordinate to be perpendicular to the block, because
that coordinate, the <i>y</i> coordinate, it's not changing. Even
though the block is sliding down the hill, when it's sliding down the
hill the usual <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, if you define them
this way, they're all changing. But by this clever choice, it's always
at <i>y</i> = 0. So, it has no <i>y</i> coordinate, there's no <i>y</i>
velocity, there's no <i>y</i> acceleration. So, we know this <i>ay</i>
= 0. So, this is an example where if we know the acceleration, by this
kind of argument, from that you deduce that <i>N</i> has to be <i>mg
cos θ</i>. Okay?</p>

<p>Then, you come to this fellow here. There we find out that
<i>ax</i>, you cancel the <i>m</i>, and you find it's equal to <i>g</i>
<i>sin θ</i>. So, that's the big result. It'll slide down the hill with
an acceleration <i>g sin θ</i>. This is a good way to measure <i>g</i>,
by the way, because if you drop something, it falls too fast for you to
time it. But if you let it go down an incline, by making <i>θ</i> very
small so <i>sin θ</i> is very small and the grading is very low, the
body can accelerate with a much slower acceleration downhill, because
it's reduced by this factor, <i>sin θ</i>.</p>

<p>Okay, here's another thing I should tell you right now. Most of us,
when we become professionals, don't put in numbers till the very end.
So, if you are told the incline is an angle of 37 degrees, <i>g</i> is
9.8, don't start putting numbers into the first equation. We don't do
that and I know for some of you it's pretty traumatic to work with
symbols, and sometimes on exams they say, oh, you had all these
problems with symbols.</p>

<p>But I want to sell you another idea. It's much better to work with
symbols than with numbers till the end. Why is that? First of all, if
you put numbers in, and I suddenly tell you, "Hey, I was wrong about
the slope, it's really 39 degrees and not 37," you're going to do the
whole calculation again. But this way, you come to the formula and you
say, "What's your <i>θ</i>?" You change your mind, okay, that's the new
<i>θ</i>. You change the value of <i>g</i>, you made a better
measurement, that's the answer. Then, you can see if your problem had
some mistakes in it. Suppose you got <i>g²</i> of <i>sin θ</i>. You
will know it's wrong because this is an acceleration and that's an
acceleration. The units have to match and <i>sin θ</i>, of course, has
no units. But maybe you got the trigonometry wrong. Maybe it's really
<i>g cos θ</i> that should be the right answer.</p>

<p>How do I know it's <i>sin θ</i>? You can do a test. We know, for
example, as the incline becomes less and less inclined, you got to get
less and less acceleration, because it's going downhill less and less,
and when <i>θ</i> goes to small values, <i>ax</i> also diminishes. Or,
if you take an incline and you really make it almost vertical, and in
the end you make it completely vertical, the block is just falling
under gravity. So, when <i>θ</i> is 90, <i>a</i> becomes <i>g</i>. So,
you can test your results. So, be prepared for that part, if you are in
this course. I will give you some homework problems in which numbers
are not put in till the very end, or I may not even ask you to put the
numbers in, because the thing is to get this formula because anyone can
take the numbers and put them in the calculator. So, that's going to be
part of our agreement that we will work with symbols. And if you look
at any calculation we do, if you caught me in my office, I'm not
putting numbers in very early. I mean, I cannot wait to find out what
the answer is but I keep the symbols till the end, then I put the
numbers. Then, you can vary different numbers. You can say, "Well, what
if gravity was weaker? I go up to Denver and do the experiment. Will I
get a different answer?" You will. So, how things depend on the input
parameters is interesting. Here's another interesting result. What is
missing in this formula that could have been there?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Mass.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me? The mass. It doesn't
seem to matter what the object is. That's an interesting property of
the result. Right? And that's because <i>m</i> cancelled out of the two
sides of that equation. So, these are all interesting features you
would not know if you kept numbers everywhere and you got <i>a</i> =
.62 meters per second squared. To me, that number doesn't tell me as
much. At the end, I want to know the number but the formula is very
interesting.</p>

<p>All right. So, now we are going to make it a little more
complicated. We are going to now add friction to this. So, here is the
block but now there's a coefficient, the friction, and let's say the
block is--Let's ask the following simple question. I think it was
related to what one of you guys said. Let the block be at rest and
<i>θ</i> is an angle I can vary. Maybe there is a little thingy here,
you can turn it back and forth. Let me crank up <i>θ</i> and see where
it'll start slipping. In other words, there is a coefficient of static
friction between the block and the plane, and I want to know, like
parking a car in San Francisco, what angle can it take before it starts
sliding down. So, let's write the forces and let's write <i>F = ma</i>.
So, the forces are again here. Let me cut to the chase and write <i>mg
cos θ</i> here, <i>N</i> here, <i>mg sin θ</i> here. What shall I write
for friction?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The first one.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Do not write
<i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> times <i>N</i>, because the frictional force is
anything you need, up to <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> times <i>N</i>. In other
words, if <i>θ</i> was very small and <i>mg sin θ</i> is very small,
the frictional force will be in fact <i>mg sin θ</i>. So, it'll equal
whatever it takes to keep it from slipping. But if I've cranked up the
angle to that maximum angle, beyond which it cannot stay there, let's
give a name to that angle that is <i>sin θ*</i>. Well, at the maximum
angle friction is doing the maximum thing it can do; then, we can
certainly say <i>mg sin θ</i> is then equal to the static friction
times <i>N</i>, which is now <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> times <i>mg cos
θ</i>. Again, the mass cancels. So, it doesn't matter what kind of car
you parked on the slope, it only depends on the following. But <i>g</i>
cancels too. So, whether you park your car on the Earth or park it on
another planet, this is going to be the same restriction, which is that
<i>tan θ</i> has to be less than or equal to <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i>;
equal to <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> is the critical value, less than that is
acceptable. Okay, that's a simple problem. If you tilt it to more than
that it'll topple over.</p>

<p>So, now let's take another problem where the block has started
moving; it's going down the hill. Now, what formula do I write? You
notice that I'm not writing every step, every time. Each time I deal
with it I'm going to do some things faster. For example, I already
resolved gravity to two parts, without going through the whole song and
dance, because you know how to do that. Now, I put in the friction. So
now, I've got <i>μ</i> sub kinetic not equal to 0, mass is moving. You
can ask, "What's the acceleration now?" So, the horizontal equation
along <i>x</i> is going to be <i>mg sin θ</i> minus <i>μ</i> kinetic
times a normal force, but allow me to write for the normal force <i>mg
cos θ</i>, and that's got to be equal to <i>m</i> times <i>ax</i>.</p>

<p>Now, can you do this? That's the test. It is not enough to watch me
do this and say, okay, he seems to know what he's doing. The question
is, can you do this? Would you have thought about this? Do you agree
that I'm not doing anything beyond Newton's laws when I do this? Yes,
each one of you should ask. If you cannot do that, you have to deal
with that now because it's only going to get compounded. On the other
hand, if you can do this, you know everything I know about Newton's
laws. This is all there is to Newton's laws and how to apply them. So,
you cancel the <i>m</i>. So, notice here, this is the normal force, but
I've taken the <i>y</i> equation that says normal force is <i>mg cos
θ</i>. Put that here. Then, I find acceleration is <i>g</i> times
<i>sin θ</i> – <i>μ</i> sub-kinetic <i>cos θ</i>.</p>

<p>Okay, here is the result: <i>ax</i> is what I'm calling <i>a</i>
now. I want to study this in various limits. The first limit I take is
no coefficient of kinetic friction, I get back to my <i>sin θ</i>.
Well, let me try the following interesting limits. I crank up the
coefficient of kinetic friction, more and more and more. Look what
happens here: <i>sin θ</i> and <i>cos θ</i> are fixed numbers. If this
becomes larger than some amount, than say 10, what happens to the
expression? <i>a</i> is negative. And what does that mean?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's going uphill.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> The block is moving uphill. And
do you buy that? So, what's wrong? I mean, I took the equation, right?
I told you all the time how you can study various limits. Something is
wrong. It says, if kinetic friction is very large, the block will move
uphill.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's not the reason. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It can't be greater than the static one.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, that's not the reason. I
mean, you can also vary the angles, maybe keeping <i>k</i> at some
value, vary the angles so that this number times that can beat this.
Then what happens? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Where do you find the direction of <i>sin θ</i>
downhill?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That is the point. Okay? Let me
repeat his answer; that's the correct answer. You're right about
kinetic being less than static and so on. But you can always imagine
keeping that number constant but changing the angle to the cosine gets
bigger and sine gets smaller. At some point, you agree, cosine will
beat the sine, because sine is going towards 0 and cosine's going
towards 1. But the correct answer is, in writing this forced law, I'm
assuming the force of friction points to the left, uphill. That is
correct only if the body is moving downhill. But if you got an answer
where <i>a</i> was negative, therefore it's going uphill, the starting
premise is wrong. So, one very useful lesson to learn here is when you
apply formula, don't forget the conditions under which you derived it,
and don't apply the result to a case where the answer does not belong
to the domain that you assumed you're applying it to.</p>

<p>So, the trouble with friction is the following. Friction is not a
definite force with a definite magnitude or direction. The magnitude is
definite, but direction is not definite. It is uphill if you're going
downhill; it's downhill if you're going uphill. It's like the constant
opposition to motion. There is force of gravity, the normal force,
everything else is a fixed direction; you can draw it once and for all.
So in a formula, where the forces are what they are in any context, you
can apply the formula in any limit. But if the frictional force assumed
a downward motion, don't apply it when the block is going up.</p>

<p>Okay, so I'm going to do one more of these inclined planes and then
pretty much done with the inclined plane. Okay, this is a problem of
two masses. There's a rope that goes over the pulley, let's call this
<i>m</i>, let's call that <i>M</i>, and this angle again, it's
<i>θ</i>, and no friction. You can mix and match various things but
let's keep friction out because I'm trying to do something different
here. So, you want to know what these guys will do now. So first guess
is, well, <i>M</i> looks so impressive compared to small <i>m</i>, so
maybe it'll go downhill. But I realize that's of course fallacy because
<i>M</i> is a symbol; the value associated with it maybe
1/10<sup>th</sup> that of <i>m</i>. But if <i>M</i> really is bigger
than <i>m</i>, then am I assured it'll go downhill?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The mass has to be greater. [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, no, I'm saying, if the big
mass <i>M</i> is bigger than the small mass <i>m</i>, is that enough to
say it'll go downhill? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> No, it depends on the angle.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It depends on the angle because
part of the mass is not helpful in going downhill. See, if I had a
pulley like this, then you're absolutely right, the big guy wins. Now,
it's not clear because this has got all of gravity pulling it down;
this has got only part of gravity pulling it down. So, let's skip this
direction, it's not very interesting. But let's look at this direction,
for which the equation is the following. If I just took that block,
it's got <i>mg sin θ</i> acting down, and this rope will exert a
certain tension <i>T</i>, here, which I don't know. Under the combined
effect of these two, I can say <i>mg sin - T = ma</i>, where <i>a</i>
is assumed to be positive going downhill. That's one equation. Then, I
come to this fellow here, this block; well, it's got <i>mg</i> acting
down and tension acting up. I'm sorry guys, I made one mistake here. I
think you know what it is. These should be <i>M</i>, that should be
<i>M</i>, sorry for that, and <i>M (Mg sin θ – T = Ma)</i>. For
<i>m</i>, the equation is <i>T – mg</i>. Now, let's be careful with
what I do next. I'm going to say <i>m</i> times <i>a</i>, which is the
same <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>You should all understand why the acceleration in magnitude is the
same. We're not saying the direction is the same. This is accelerating
downhill, at some angle; that's accelerating uphill. These are not
equations which are vectors; these stand for equations along certain
directions. This is the up/down direction here, and that is up the
slope, down the slope direction, for that one. But I think you realize
if the rope is inelastic, if this mass moves down one inch, that's got
to go up one inch. Therefore, if it goes one inch in one second, so
will the other guy, they'll have the same velocity and they'll have the
same acceleration. So, that's why there's only one unknown
acceleration, <i>a</i>. Once you realize that you're done because now
we know what to do. Whenever you see <i>a –T</i> and <i>a + T</i>, you
add them and you get <i>g</i> times <i>M sin θ - m</i>. On this side,
it's going to be <i>M + m</i> times <i>a</i>. Can you see that? So, let
me short circuit one step, and divide by <i>M</i> + <i>m</i>. So,
that's the formula here. And again, you got to ask, does it make sense?
Now you notice that for it to be positive, and to go downhill, it's not
enough if <i>M</i> is bigger than <i>m</i>. <i>M sin θ</i> should be
bigger than <i>m</i>; that's because <i>M sin θ</i> is the part that's
really pulling downhill. <i>M cos θ</i> is trying to ram it into the
inclined plane, and that's being countered by the normal force. The
second thing to notice is: can I use this formula when <i>m</i> is
bigger than <i>M sin θ</i>? In other words, can I use this formula when
<i>a</i> becomes a negative? After all, I did all my thinking saying
it's going down, but can I use it when it's going up?</p>

<p><b>Students:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, and the reason? Anybody
want to say why that's okay here? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> No friction.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> And friction is a force, depending upon which
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's correct. All the forces I
drew here, they're not going to change their mind when you change the
body's motion. Gravity is always going to pull down. So, all these
forces are fixed in magnitude and direction, and therefore once you got
a formula for positive <i>a</i>, you can apply it to negative <i>a</i>,
but you cannot do it when you have friction because in friction, you
assume the direction of motion.</p>

<p>All right, so now I'm going to leave the plane. This is it. We are
finished with the plane. You are not finished because, oh don't clap
here, I got a homework problem, by popular demand. Two masses, one
pulley and friction. That's to really say we're finished with the
plane. Once you can do that, you've graduated from this boot camp; you
can handle anything else. But that's not something I want to do in
class. That's something you do in the privacy of your room, put all
these things in and crank it up. And you also have enough time. But
that's a very--that's got some interesting angles you should think
about.</p>

<p>Okay, so now I'm going to do physics that basically involves
rotational motion. But let me do one Mickey-Mouse problem, and let it
go, because I assigned it to you. The typical problem is: there's a
tree here, there's a tree here, and that is--there are two ropes and
there's a backpack hanging here with some weight. You are told what
that angle is; you're told what that angle is. You are supposed to find
the tension on these two ropes. I think it's fairly simple so I won't
do the details but you know what you're supposed to do. You take these
two tensions, break them into the horizontal parts, with sines and
cosines, and into vertical parts; horizontal parts that cancel because
of this mass. This backpack is not going anywhere horizontally; the
vertical parts of these two, which will be in fact additive, should
cancel the weight of the object. That gives you two simultaneous
equations for T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, and you can fiddle with
them, and solve them.</p>

<p>Well, by the way I should tell you, if you got some equation like
<i>T<sub>1</sub> sin θ <sub>1</sub> = T<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>sin θ
<sub>2</sub></i>, or that – <i>T<sub>2</sub> sin θ</i> is 0, and
another equation involving <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> with some numbers and
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Some of you seemed to have trouble the other day
when there were <i>sin θ</i>s here; whereas, if these had been numbers
like 3 and 4, you knew how to solve these simultaneous equations. But I
want you to realize that the solving of the simultaneous equations for
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> involve forming
combinations of these coefficients to eliminate either
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> or <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. So, when you add them,
one of them drops out. And that doesn't depend on whether these are
trigonometric functions or any other numbers, they're eliminated in the
same way. Likewise on the right hand side, instead of some numbers like
3 and 4, you have the weight, <i>W</i>, of this mass; well, if you
multiply this equation by 3, multiply everything by 3 and juggle them.
So, you should get used to eliminating coefficients which are not
simply numbers, which are symbols, sines, cosines, but you know how
to--If you had a sine here and a cosine there, for example, how will
you combine them? Maybe you'll multiply this by a cosine and that by a
sine, and if you subtract it'll drop out. You've got to do stuff like
that. Okay? But it's important that in a Physics 200 Level course you
are able to solve those things.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm coming to the interesting problems in which motion
involves going in a circle. So here's one problem. This is a string on
which there is a mass and the mass is going around in a circle. This is
like an amusement park, so that they have these dangling little, tiny,
baby rockets and you sit there and start spinning, and instead of being
vertical, it starts lifting up, and you want to know why it's lifting
up. So, if this angle here is <i>θ</i>, and this is some mass <i>m</i>,
and it's going around in a circle with velocity <i>v</i>, and the
radius of the circle is say <i>r</i>; we want to find some relation
between this angle <i>θ</i> and these other parameters in the problem.
So what do I do? I apply <i>F = ma</i>, that's it; and I'm going to get
everything by applying <i>F = ma</i>, to this guy. So, here is that
mass. The tension on the rope can only be along the rope. The rope is
not a rigid object. It cannot exert a force perpendicular to itself. It
can only pull it along each direction. That's the tension on the rope.
There is <i>mg</i>, and that's it. Under these things it's going to
obey <i>F = ma</i>. So, what I do with this tension is I trade this guy
for two forces. This is <i>T</i>. If that angle is <i>θ</i>; let me
see, that angle is <i>θ</i>; so this is <i>T sin θ</i>, and this is
<i>T cos θ</i>. So, you trade that oblique <i>T</i> for two <i>T</i>s
that are in the actual simple directions. The fact that it's not going
up or down vertically tells me <i>mg</i> = <i>T sin θ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Students:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, I'm sorry, yes. Okay, then
in the other direction <i>T sin θ</i> is the horizontal force, that's
got to be mass times acceleration. At the instant--but I've shown the
object, because it's going in a circle, it has an acceleration, in this
direction, with size <i>v²/R</i>. Therefore, if you divide this
equation by that equation you will get <i>v²/Rg = tan θ</i>, and that's
the angle that the string will assume. So, if you know the velocity you
can do this problem.</p>

<p>Okay, then here's another interesting problem. When you go on these
roads, if you're going in a circle--so for this is your car, I'm
looking at you from the top, you're going in a circle. Anything wrong?
Going in a circle, you're accelerating towards the center; someone's
got to provide the force, that's what Newton says. That force is the
friction between your tire and the road. In fact, it's a case of static
friction. You might think it's kinetic because the car is moving, but
it's not moving in this direction. So, it's a static friction that
keeps you from slipping. So, you need a certain static friction; so
that <i>N</i> times <i>μ</i> static -- that <i>N</i> is equal to
<i>mg</i> -- must be equal to <i>mv²/R</i>. If you don't have the
static friction, your car will not be able to make the curve, it'll fly
off.</p>

<p>So, what people have done is to find a clever way in which you don't
have to have any friction and you can still make the turn; that is, to
bank your road. So imagine, now you're going into the blackboard and
you're turning left, and the road looks like this, going away from me.
Now, I don't have to draw this thing. This road is a track, a racetrack
going around and round like this. And I gave it some angle <i>θ</i>.
This road has no friction so it can only exert a force that way. But
let me resolve that force into two parts, one like this and one like
this. Again, if these two have an angle <i>θ</i>, that is the same
angle <i>θ</i> there, and there is the mass of the car this way. So,
what do I find? I find <i>N cos θ = mg</i> and <i>N sin θ = mv²/R</i>.
Therefore, if you again take the ratios you will find <i>tan θ =
v²/Rg</i>. I think this may be a little fast now but you guys can do
the algebra.</p>

<p>What that means is the following. If you want the car to go around
the bend, at a certain speed, 40 miles per hour or so many kilometers
per hour, and the road itself is part of a circle of radius <i>r</i>;
it doesn't have to be a full circle. At that instant it has to be a
part of a circle. Then, if you bank your road at that angle, you don't
need any friction to make the turn. You got to understand how we beat
the system. If your road instead of being flat is tilted, then even
though the road can only exert a frictionless normal force, now part of
the normal force is pointing to the center. In fact, this picture is
not drawn to scale. If I drew it that way, this part of the vector is
horizontal and directed towards the center of the circle, on which you
orbit. So, that's how you do the banking. In any good system of roads
you will find there is banking.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to do the last problem because it's in the homework,
and maybe I'm a little late today, I apologize for that. The last
problem is a very famous, very important, and that's the loop-the-loop
problem. As you know, the loop-the-loop is when you come down on a
track, you go on a circle, and for awhile you're upside down. And the
famous question is, "Why don't you fall down?" What's the trick? Does
it violate Newton's laws, and so on? We'll find we can understand it
fully with Newton's laws. But we'll find out that in order for this
thing to pull it off, its speed at that instant has to have a minimum
value. And the application of Newton's law to this object is very
simple. Here is gravity. What about the track on which it's going?
What's the direction of the force the track exerts?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Down.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me? Down. Anybody said
up? A track cannot exert a force upwards, down. So everybody, track,
<i>mg</i> and they're all acting down. So you see, that's when you get
a little worried. Okay, this guy's up there, all the forces are down.
So, we got to ask, so what does that mean? Well, I have to agree
they're all down. I say <i>T + mg</i> is the downward force, that's got
to be <i>mv²/r</i>. Therefore, <i>T = m</i> times <i>(v²/R – g)</i>.
So, what does that mean? If this <i>T</i> comes out negative, you're
dead, because if it's negative, you want the track to exert an upward
force and it cannot. In a real amusement park they have other
<i>T</i>-brackets and so on to support you. But if you really believe
in the laws of physics, you don't need any of that, you just got to
make sure this number is positive. For it to be positive, you need
<i>v²</i> bigger than or equal to <i>Rg</i>. So, you got to make sure
when you're on the top, you have this minimum velocity. If you go
faster than that, that is just fine; if you go faster than that,
<i>T</i> will be some positive number. So, here's the interesting
thing. Have we escaped the pull of gravity? How come we are not falling
down? And the track is not helping us, it's also pushing us down.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The velocity vector is moving towards the left and
the force; well, the full force is changing the direction of the
velocity towards the center, but it's still going along a circular
path.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You can make that for forced radials today.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. So, the point is, if you
have an apple, with two forces, both pushing down, that apple is
accelerating down, and accelerating down means really falling towards
the ground, towards the center of the circle here. In this example, it
is definitely accelerating, but the acceleration is not added to zero
velocity, in which case it'll pick up more and more speed; it's added
to a huge horizontal velocity. So, in a tiny time, you give it a little
velocity like this, your new velocity points at a new angle. That just
means your body has come here and has stopped going like that and
started going like this. Therefore, downward acceleration does not mean
coming closer to the ground, it only means your velocity vector is
changing its direction. On the other hand, if you had no velocity
vector, downward acceleration means what you think it is. That is why,
if you drop an apple from here, it has an acceleration due to
<i>mg</i>; if the track was pushing it down even more, it'll fall
towards the ground and hit the ground. Here it actually has an
acceleration but it doesn't mean that you are any closer to the center.
Going around in a circle is an example of constantly accelerating
towards the center but not getting any closer. That's the way vectors
work and you should think about that. Ok, so that's it for now.</p>
