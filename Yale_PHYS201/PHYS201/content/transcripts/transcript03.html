<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: </b>All
right, class, I thought I'd start as usual by telling you what happened last
time. Not the whole thing, but just the highlights so you can follow what's
happening today. The main things I did last time were the notion of an
electric field, which is going to be with you from now till the end of the
course. The idea of the electric field is that if you've got lots of charges, <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>q<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>q<sub>3</sub></i>, instead of worrying about the force
they exert on each other, you ask yourself, at a generic point where there's
nothing, if I put 1 coulomb here, what will it experience? What force will it
experience? You compute that. </p>
<p>So in your mind,
imagine a coulomb, and you find the force due to <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, it looks
like that. <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> may exert a force that way. <i>q<sub>3</sub></i>
could be of opposite sign, so maybe it will exert a force that way. You add
all these vectors, they add up to something. That something is called the
electric field at that point. There is nothing there except the electric
field, but it's very real, because if you put something, something happens to
it. So the electric field is everywhere. The charges are in a few places.
Electric field is defined everywhere, except right on top of the charges, which
is where it probably is infinite. Once you know the electric field anywhere,
if you put another charge <i>q</i>, a real charge, it will experience a force equal
to <i>qE</i>, because electric field was the force you would have had on the 1
coulomb, and if you put <i>q</i> coulombs, it will be <i>qE</i>. That's the
electric field. </p>
<p>So you can imagine
computing it for any given distribution of charges, because you know what each
one of them does. Then I said there's one nice way to visualize the electric
field, which is to draw the field lines. You go to each point and you ask, if
I put a charge here, a positive test charge, which way will it move? Then you
follow that thing as it moves and you get that line and you get that line and you
get that line. You can draw these lines. The lines give you one piece of
information which is very obvious, namely, if you are here, the force is along
that line. But I also pointed out to you, you get more than just the direction
of the force. You also can understand the strength of the force. The strength
of the force is contained in the density of these lines. </p>
<p>Now density has to be
defined carefully. It's not like mass per unit volume. It's an area density.
That means if you get yourself 1 square meter, you know, meter by meter piece
of wood, like a frame, and you hold it there, perpendicular to the lines and
see how many lines go through, that's called the area density of lines. That
you can see will fall like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, because if you draw a sphere
of radius <i>r</i>, that area is 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>, and the same number of
lines are going through that as any other sphere, so it will be proportional to
1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. But so is the electrical field proportional to 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
and I said, let us agree that we will draw 1/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> lines per
coulomb. This is a necessity; it's just a convenience. It's like saying I want
to measure distances in inches and centimeters for daily life. You can measure
them in parsecs and angstroms, but you'll be dealing with nasty numbers. </p>
<p>So it's a
convenience, and the convenience here is, let's pick 1/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>
lines per coulomb. You'll see the advantage of that, because if you ask,
what's the density of lines here on a sphere of radius <i>r</i>, if there's
charge <i>q</i> at the center, I got that many lines, and the area of the
sphere is 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>, so the density of lines per unit area, you
see, is precisely equal in magnitude to the electric field at that point. If
you had not drawn 1/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, but maybe 5/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>
lines, then the line density will be 5 times the electric field. It will still
represent the electric field, but we don't want to simply represent it. We
want it to be the electric field. It makes it easier. </p>
<p>Then I said, let's
take a slightly more complicated situation, two charges. This is called a
dipole, one pole and another pole, and you can draw the field lines here. You
can see if you put a test charge, it'll run away from the plus to the minus. If
you leave it somewhere here, it'll go like that and loop around and come back,
and you can calculate them. This is no longer guesswork. If you had enough
time, I hope you all agree, you can go to any point you like and find the force
of attraction due to this one, the force of repulsion due to that one, add them
up and you will get an arrow that direction. So one can draw these lines, and
the lines tell you a story. Then I said, let us find the field in an analytic
expression due to the dipole. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I have a question
about the dipole. If you put a test particle going in the positive direction
of the x axis, would it also _________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. She's got a good point. If you put somebody here, it will never loop
around. Can you see why? Because as it goes further away, this is trying to
pull it back. It's always going to be closer to this guy, so it's never going
to come back. This line will go like that and this line will go like this.
But anything else at any other angle will loop around and come back. All
right, now the field strength, if you want to calculate it, you can use the
formula for <i>E</i> due to this one and <i>E</i> due to that one and add them,
and I did that for you. I don't want to go into the details, but I remind you
in all cases, the electric field fell like 1/<i>r<sup>3</sup></i>, because the
field of each charges goes like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. And if these were on
top of each other, they will completely cancel each other. So the reason you
have a non-zero field is thanks to <i>a</i>. </p>
<p>Therefore the answer
has to contain an <i>a</i> in front of it, at least <i>n</i> the first
approximation. But that <i>a</i>, from dimensional analysis, has to come with
a 1/<i>r</i> so that the whole thing has the same dimension as before. That's
where you get a/<i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. That <i>a</i> times <i>q</i> times 2 and
so on, that became the dipole moment. That was true here. We verified that's
true here. Later on, we'll verify it everywhere, because there are easier ways
to calculate than what I'm using. Then I said, forget about the field due to
charges. Let's look at what charges do when you put them in a field. So I
took two examples. One was a very simple example. These are two parallel
plates. They are not two lines; they are plates coming out of the blackboard.
They're filled with charge and this has got + charge on it. This has got -
charge on it. And therefore, the electric field will look like this, right?
Because if you leave a test charge, it will go away from the positive, towards
the negative. </p>
<p>Then I said, suppose
there really is a particle here with some velocity, <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>, what
will it do? You can see that the force on this guy is going to be <i>q</i>
times <i>E</i>. <i>E</i> is pointing down. If you divide by the mass, that's
the acceleration, also pointing down, and it's constant. So that's like a
particle in a gravitational field, except <i>g</i> is replaced by this number.
So it will just curve like that, and you can calculate the trajectory. The
final thing I did was, what happens when you put a dipole in a uniform field.
Here as well, I think I was rushing near the end, and even I couldn't read my
stuff in the corner. So I will go over that. If there's something that you
didn't follow, then I will be happy to repeat that part for you. But you
should understand what the question is. There is an electric field which is
pointing like this, as if you have two plates here, + charge is here, - charge
is there. They're producing a constant electric field in the horizontal direction.
In that environment, I take an electric dipole whose - charge and + charge, +<i>q</i>
and -<i>q</i>, happen to be oriented like that. </p>
<p>Question is, what
will happen to this guy? If you want, you can imagine that it's a little
massless stick, and one end you glue <i>q</i> coulombs, other end you glue -<i>q</i>
coulombs, and your let it sit there. What will it do? First of all, it won't
feel any net force, because the force in this direction is <i>q</i> times <i>E</i>
and the force that direction is also <i>q</i> times <i>E</i>, if you want, it's
-<i>q</i> times <i>E</i> and they cancel. But that doesn't mean it won't
react. It will react, because you can all see intuitively, it's trying to
straighten this guy out and applying a torque like that. You follow that?
That's what it will do. And the way to find the torque, the torque is the
product of the force and the distance between the point of rotation and the
force, and the sine of the angle between them, that is to say, sine of this
angle. What the sine of the angle does is to take the component of the force perpendicular
to this axis, because if you resolve the force into that part and that part,
this part is no good for rotation. That's trying to stretch the dipole along
its own length. It's the perpendicular part that's going to rotate something,
so you get that times sine theta. </p>
<p>That you can write
now as the vector equation <i>p</i> x <i>E</i>. Because <i>p</i> is equal
to--I'm sorry. I need a 2 here. I forgot the 2, because this charge will have
a torque and that charge will have a torque and the two torques are additive. They
are both going the same way. Then 2<i>q</i> times <i>a</i> is <i>p</i>, and
this is <i>E</i> and the sin<i>&#952;</i> comes in the cross product. I'm assuming
all of you know about the cross product. </p>
<p>Okay, final thing I
did, which is, if you have a force, you can associate with that force a
potential energy. Again, this is something you must have seen last time, but I
will remind you. As long as it's not a frictional force, you can say the force
is connected to potential energy in this following fashion. Or the potential
energy at <i>x</i> minus potential energy at some starting point <i>x<sub>0 </sub></i>--
I'm sorry, <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>x</i> is the integral of the force from <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>
to <i>x</i>. </p>
<p>This is the relation
between the force, as delivered to the potential, and the potential is the
integral of the force. For example, for a spring, <i>U</i> is &frac12;<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>,
and <i>F</i> = -<i>kx</i>. If you go to this one, we tell you <i>U(x<sub>0</sub>)</i>
- <i>U(x)</i> is equal to the integral of -<i>kx</i> <i>dx</i> from <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>
to <i>x</i>. So that gives you <i>kx<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>/2 &#8722; <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>/2.
And by comparison, you can see <i>U(x)</i> = &frac12;<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>. Actually,
this is not the unique answer. Do you know why? Given this formula, can I
immediately say this guy corresponds to that, this one corresponds to that
one? Is there some latitude here? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You can always add
in a constant.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You can add a constant to both, because if I said that, that certainly works.
If I add 92 to both, it still works, because the 92 extra doesn't matter when
you take the difference. So it's conventional to simply pick the constant so
that the formula looks simple. Coming to other expression, if you had a
torque, which is <i>pE</i>sin<i>&#952;</i>, you can ask--that's the torque--it's
minus, because it's trying to reduce the angle <i>&#952;</i>--you can ask what <i>U</i>
leads to that. And you can see it's -<i>pE</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>. See that, take the
-<i>U</i> and take the derivative, you'll get the torque. But if you got two
vectors, <i>p</i> and <i>E</i> and you see the cos<i>&#952;</i>, I hope you guys
know that you can write it as a dot product. So that's the end of what I did
last time, okay? </p>
<p>The potential energy
is proportional to the dot product of <i>p</i> with <i>E</i>. The torque is
equal to the cross product of <i>p</i> with <i>E</i>. And what does <i>pE</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>
mean if you plot it as a function of angle? It will look like this. This is &Pi;
and this is 0. That means it likes to sit here and if you deviate a little bit
and let it go there, it'll rattle back and forth, just like a mass spring
system. In fact, you can very easily show, near the bottom of the well, the
potential energy is proportional to <i>&#952;<sup>2</sup></i>. That's because cos<i>&#952;</i>
can be written as 1 &#8722; <i>&#952;<sup>2</sup></i>/2+ <i>&#952;<sup>4</sup></i>/4!, etc. for
small angles. If you just keep that term, you will find it looks like this.
Not very different from <i>U</i> = <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>. So what <i>x</i>
does with forces, <i>&#952;</i> does with rotations. All right, so this is what we
did last time. Now I'm going to do the new stuff. So new stuff is going to
give you--I think it's useful, because it tells you the level at which you
should be able to do calculations. </p>
<p>So here's a typical
problem. You have an infinite line of charge, of which I will show that part,
and somebody has sprinkled on it &#955; coulombs per meter. So it is not a discrete
set of charges; it's assumed to be continuous and it's everywhere. I'm just
showing a few of them, and if you cut out one meter, you'll find there's &#955;
coulombs there. And you want to compute the electric field you will get due to
this distribution, everywhere. So you want to go somewhere here and ask what's
the electric field. That's what we're going to do. Let's go here. You will
see why. Now first of all, you've got to have an intuition on which way the
electric field will point. You have a feeling? Yes. It will point here, this
way. Why not like that? Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay. She said the horizontal parts will cancel. That's correct. Another
argument from symmetry is that if anybody can give you a reason why it should
tilt to the left, I can say, &quot;Why don't you use the same argument to say
it will tilt to the right?&quot; Because this is an infinitely long wire and
things look the same if you look to the left and if you look to the right. And
the field you get should have the same property. If this was a finite wire, I
wouldn't say that, because in a finite wire, that can be a tilt, somewhere
here. But infinite wire, it cannot tilt to the left or to the right, because
each point has the same symmetric situation to its right and to its left. In a
finite wire, it's not true. Life to the left is different from the life to the
right, but for infinite wire, you know it cannot be biased one way or the
other. It's got to go straight up. </p>
<p>Secondly, you can
find the field here, here, here or at anywhere at the same distance, you've got
to get the same answer. Again, because if you move two inches to the right, it
doesn&#39;t make any difference with an infinite wire. You've still got infinite
wire on either side. So we'll pick a typical point and calculate the field and
we know that answer is going to be good throughout that line. So now I take
this point here. I want the field here. I'm going to make that my origin.
Then I take a piece of wire of length <i>dx</i>. <i>dx</i> is so small that I
can treat it as a point. Now the <i>dx</i> I've drawn is not a point, but in
the end, we're going to make <i>dx</i> arbitrarily small so that it's good
enough. It's like a point and it is at a distance <i>x</i> from the origin,
and let's say that distance is <i>a</i>. </p>
<p>So let's find the
field due to just this guy, the shaded region. Think of a charge. How much
charge is sitting here? I hope you all agree, the charge sitting in this
region is just &#955; times <i>dx</i>. That's just the definition. If you've got
that many coulombs, imagine a test charge of 1 here. Well, it will push it
this way, and the field due to that, I'm going to draw as infinitesimal, so I'm
going to call it <i>dE</i>. You can call it <i>E</i>, but <i>dE</i> is to
remind you, it's a tiny field, due to a tiny section <i>dx</i>. Now that
electric field is biased to the left, but for every such section you find here,
I'll find a section on the other side that's precisely biased to the right by
the same amount. Therefore the only part that's going to survive due to this
guy, combined with this, will be the portion here, which is the vertical part
of that force. So let me find the contribution first, only from this one, then
we will add the contribution for this one. For that one, you just find the
vertical projection. </p>
<p>So how much is that?
Remember, the Coulomb's law for the electric field is <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
So this is the <i>q</i>. That's the 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
is that distance squared, which is <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>.
That's really like the field of a point charge at that distance. But now this
is the magnitude of the electric field vector at this angle, but I want the
part along the <i>y</i> direction. So I've got to take cosine of that <i>&#952;</i>.
You guys follow that? If you took this vector, this part is <i>dE</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>.
That part is <i>dE</i>sin<i>&#952;</i>. But that angle and that angle are equal,
and cos<i>&#952;</i> for this triangle, you can see, is <i>a</i> divided by (<i>a<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>&frac12;</sup>. So this is the electric field in the <i>y</i>
direction. I'm going to call it <i>dE</i>, in the <i>y</i> direction,
due to the segment <i>dx</i>. The total electric field is obtained by adding
all the <i>dE</i>s or adding all the contributions from all the segments
on this line. And that goes from - infinity to + infinity. All right, so now
it's a matter of just doing this integral. </p>
<p>So this gives me (<i>&#955;a</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>)
<i>dx</i>/(x<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>3/2</sup>, integrated from - to +
infinity. Now I can make life a little easier by saying that this function is
an even function of <i>x</i>. That means when you change <i>x</i> to -<i>x</i>,
it doesn&#39;t care. Therefore the contribution from a positive <i>x</i> region is
the same as the contribution from a negative <i>x</i> region. That also makes
sense in this picture here, because if you look at the field I'm computing,
this section and this section give equal contributions in the <i>y</i>
direction. But even if you did not know any of that background, as a
mathematician, if you see this integral, you would say, &quot;Hey, put a 0
there and put a 2 here&quot; namely,integrate over half the region, because
the second half is giving you the same answer. So you double the integral, but
cut the region of integration in half. </p>
<p>So at this point, you
are free to look up a book, if it was an exam, but maybe not even if it was an
exam at your level. You should be able to do this integral. So integrals have
been around from the time of Newton and the question of an integral is, find
the area of some graph with this particular functional form. And the answer to
any integral is that function whose derivative is the integrand. So what you
have to do is guess many answers until you get the right one. But people have
been guessing for hundreds of years, and there's big tables of integrals with
all the integrals you want. But you should still be able to do some integrals
from scratch and I'm going to tell you how to do this one. But before you do the
integral, you've got to have some idea what the answer is going to look like.
I want you to get some feeling about this. Answer depends on what, is the
first question. What's the answer going to depend on?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>a</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
<i>a</i>, you understand? Whatever this is depends only on <i>a</i> because 0
and infinity are not going to be present as part of the answer. If the lower
limit was 5, it can depend on 5, but it doesn't depend on any other thing,
other than <i>a</i>. Then from dimension analysis, I got a length squared to
the 3/2, that's length cubed, and a length on the top, so whole thing should
look like something over length squared. The only length I have is <i>a</i>,
so it's going to look like 1 over <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> times a number. Once
you got the number, you're done. So I'm going to do all the work now to show
you that the number is actually just 1. This number will turn out to be 1, in
which case, you will find it's &#955;/2<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>a</i>. Well, let's see how
we get the number to be 1. So does anybody know what trick you use to do this
integral? This is whatever, math 120 or-- yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Use substitution?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. What substitution?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> = <i>U</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That won't help you. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Can you use
trigonometric substitution?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. Trigonometric substitution. Which one? Okay, look--no, no, I don&#39;t
blame you. I know the answer because I've seen it, but if I have to work on
it, I'll try for a while before I got it right. The whole idea is, we don't
like all these 3 _______ here. We want to turn that into something nice. So
I'll tell you what the answer is. You can all marvel at how wonderfully it
works. So what we are going to do is to introduce an angle theta--nothing to
do with the angle in the problem--so that x = tan<i>&#952;</i>. </p>
<p>That means instead of
going over all values of <i>x</i>, I'll go with the suitable values of <i>&#952;</i>--I'm
sorry, this would not even be correct dimensionally. <i>x </i>= <i>a</i>tan<i>&#952;</i>.
You can see that every <i>x</i> that I want, I can get by some choice of theta,
because tan<i>&#952;</i> goes from 0 to infinity when <i>&#952;</i> goes from 0 to &Pi;/2. You cannot say <i>x</i>
= <i>a</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>, for example. You are doomed. If <i>x</i> is <i>a</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>,
the biggest <i>x </i>you can get is <i>a</i>, whereas I want this <i>x</i> to
go from 0 to infinity. So when you make the change of variables, you've got to
make sure that for every <i>x</i> you want, there is some <i>&#952;</i> that will do
it. Then the next thing you do, you say <i>dx</i>/<i>d&#952;</i> = <i>a</i> times
derivative of tan<i>&#952;</i> which is sec<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>. Then you write
that as <i>dx</i> = that. What that means is an integral <i>dx</i> is related
to an integral <i>d&#952; </i>by this factor. Therefore going to the integration
here, I'm just doing that part, which is going to be a sec<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i> <i>d&#952;</i>.
<i>&#952;</i> goes from 0 to &Pi;/2. Now let's look downstairs. Downstairs I've got <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>. <i>x</i> itself is <i>a</i>tan<i>&#952;</i>, therefore a<sup>2</sup>
times 1 + tan<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>. 1 + tan<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i> happens to be
sec<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>. That to the power 3/2, which is what I want, will
give me an <i>a<sup>3</sup></i>sec<sup>3</sup><i>&#952;</i>. So what do we get? </p>
<p>You can see as
promised I get a 1/a<sup>2</sup> and I get integral of 1/sec<i>&#952;</i>, which is
cos<i>&#952;d&#952;</i> from 0 to &Pi;/2. Yes. And integral of cos<i>&#952;</i> is sin<i>&#952;</i>
from &Pi;/2 to 0. That just happens to be 1. So the final answer is what I gave
you here, <i>E</i>. Well, <i>E</i> is the vector. I've just shown you the
magnitude, but we've all agreed what the direction is. The direction is away
from the wire. So if you like, if you look at this wire from the end, the
lines will look like this. If the infinite wire is coming out of the
blackboard towards you and you look at it this way, if you go too close, you'll
poke your eyes out. Look from here, you'll see the lines are going out radial
everywhere. The question is, how do the fields get weak? How does it weaken
with distance? It weakens like 1/<i>a</i>. That's a big of a surprise, right?
The field away from the wire doesn't fall like 1 over distance squared, but
falls like 1 over distance. The reason is that every individual portion of the
wire has a contribution that does fall like 1 over distance squared, but it is
an infinite wire. When you add it all up, the net answer goes like 1 over the
distance. The field away from a wire falls like the distance from the wire, on
the perpendicular from the wire and there's pointing away from the wire.
That's it.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's one
calculation. Then I'm going to do one more and that's going to be the end of
the tough calculations. Second calculation is going to be an infinite sheet.
On the infinite sheet, the appropriate quantity is called the charge density,
which is coulombs per meter squared. That means if you cut out a tiny piece,
the charge on it will be sigma times the area of that piece. So there is
positive charge everywhere here, and the number of coulombs per unit area is
called sigma. These are standard. &#955; is coulombs per meter, &#963; is used for
coulombs per unit area. The question is, what's going to be the electric field
at some point away from that plane? </p>
<p>Once again, I think
we can all agree that the electric field at some point from the plane will not depend
on where in front of the plane you are standing. Are you standing here or are
you standing there? It doesn't matter, because it's an infinite plane. If I
moved 1 inch--I'll tell you why it won't matter. If I moved 1 inch and the
answer changed, I should get the same change if I didn't move and somebody
moved the sheet 1 inch the other way. But when I move an infinite sheet the
other way by 1 inch, it looks exactly the same. It's got to produce exactly
the same field. So you can always ask, what will happen if I move to the left,
the same as what will happen if the sheet moves to the right? The sheet moving
to the right looks exactly like the sheet before. The answer won't change,
therefore the answer won't change for you if you move to the left. I've got
infinite plane below you. As long as you don't change the distance from the
plane, you navigate perpendicular to it, no matter where you are, you will get
the same answer. Same answer, meaning same direction of the field, same
magnitude. And that direction has to be perpendicular to the plane, again for
symmetry reasons. If you tilt it in any one direction, you have no reason to
do it. For example, if you tilt it this way, I can take the infinite plane and
rotate it, then the tilt will be in some other direction, maybe like that, but
the rotated infinite plane looks the same. In other words, if the cause does
not change, the effect should not change. If I can do certain things to the
infinite plane that leave it invariant, then I can do the same transformation
to the location of the point, and that shouldn't have a different answer. </p>
<p>So the plane has the
property that when you slide it up and down parallel to itself, or twist it and
turn it, it looks the same, therefore the field pattern should have that
property. Therefore the field has to be the same at all distances from the
plane anywhere on top of the plane, and it's going to point this way. But you
can also find out in a minute--by the way, you don't need any of the symmetry
arguments. You just do the calculation by brute force, it will have these
properties. But it's good to know what to anticipate, because maybe you made a
mistake somewhere. It's good to know some broad features. So none of this is
needed to calculate, even in that problem. Go ahead and find the electric
field not where I found it, but 2 inches to the right. You'll find the answer
looks the same. So those symmetry properties will come out of the wash, but
it's good for you to anticipate that, and that's where you should look at the
symmetry of the source. </p>
<p>For example, the
source was a ball of charge. You know if you rotate the ball, when I'm not
looking to rotate the ball, it's going to look the same. That means the field
pattern should have the property, when you rotate it, it looks the same,
because the same cause should produce the same effect. Anyway, going to this
problem now, let's find the electric field here. Okay, now this is going to be
a stretch for me to draw, so I'm going to try, but you'll have to go look at
some textbook if you want a really nice looking picture, but this is the best I
can do. I take a ring of radius <i>r</i> and thickness <i>dr</i>. I take an
annulus, and I ask, what will that ring do to this point? So let's take a tiny
part of that ring, this guy. </p>
<p>Well, for that, you
just did what you did, you draw the line here. You'll produce a <i>dE</i><b> </b>that
looks like this. What is its magnitude? Magnitude is just given by Coulomb's
law. The <i>q</i> there is sigma times the tiny area, <i>dA</i>. Let's call
this <i>dA</i>. <i>dA</i> is the name for a small area. &#963; times <i>dA</i> is
the name for a small charge. That charge will produce a force, 1/4&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>,
square of the distance, r<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>. Finally, here is where
the symmetry comes in, can you see that for every section here, I can find an
opposite section that will cancel everything but the part perpendicular to the
plane? So I should only keep this portion of it. Namely, I should take the
cos<i>&#952;</i>. The cosine of that <i>&#952;</i> is the distance <i>a</i>, just like
in the other problem, <i>a</i>/(<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>&frac12;</sup>.
This is now <i>dE</i>. If you want, you can put this following symbol, <i>dE</i><sub>perp</sub>,
meaning perpendicular to the plane. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Do you need to
multiply by 2 again, because you're __________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Let's be careful. Her question was, should I multiply by 2, because of this
guy here, right? In fact, I should multiply by all kinds of other numbers,
because so far, I've found the field only due to this segment here. I've got
to add the field due to that and that and that and so on, right? What will
that contribution be? For every one of them, this factor, (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>3/2</sup> is the same. They all contribute to the
same factor, so when I added the shaded region, I'll just get the area of the
shaded region. All these <i>dA</i>s, if you add them up, what will I get? It
will be sigma over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. Now you've got to ask yourself,
what's the area of an annulus of radius <i>r </i>and thickness <i>dr</i>? </p>
<p>So take that annulus,
take a pair of scissors and you cut it, and you stretch it out like that, it's
going to look like this. This is <i>dr</i> and this is 2<i>&Pi;r</i>. So the
area of an annulus is just 2<i>&Pi;r dr</i>. So the sum of all these areas is 2<i>&Pi;r
dr</i> and then I've got here (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>3/2</sup>.
But now this is the <i>dE</i>, due to annulus of thickness of <i>dr</i>. Then
I've got to integrate over all values of <i>r</i>, but <i>r</i> goes from 0 to
infinity. So I have here &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub> times <i>rdr</i>, divided by (<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>3/2</sup>, 0 to infinity.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Did I miss a pi?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Shouldn't it be
sigma over ____ pi?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There is a 2 pi here.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, okay, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
2<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. So do you understand what I did? I broke the plane
into concentric rings and I took one ring and looking head on at that ring, I
took a portion of that ring and see what field is produces. And I know that
even though the field due to that is at an angle, the only part that's going to
remain is the part perpendicular to the plane, because the counterpart to this
one on the other side will produce a similar field with the opposite angle here
that will cancel, so only the part perpendicular will survive. Then I found
out that the contribution from every <i>dA</i> had exactly these factors. They
all had the same <i>r</i> and they all had the same <i>a</i>, so some of all
the <i>dA</i>s, all I have to add is 2<i>&Pi;r</i> <i>dr</i>. And that's the
contribution from this annulus, then I still have to look at annulus of every
radius, so that's the integral over dr. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What happened to
the <i>a</i> _______? I thought it was <i>a</i> over--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, I'm sorry. It's there. Thank you. There is an <i>a</i> still here.
Yeah, I would have caught that guy in a while, but I'm always happy when you do
that. That's correct. Okay, so now about how this integral. Do you have any
idea what you might do now? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Use substitution.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. What substitution? &quot;Use substitution&quot; is a pretty safe
answer, but you've got to go a little beyond that.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Substitute <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> for the ________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. You can do that in this problem, because there's an <i>r </i>on the top.
If you didn't have the <i>r</i>, you couldn't do that, but now you can. I'll
tell you how it works. First of all, you can always do that tan<i>&#952;</i>
substitution even here. It will always work. The tan<i>&#952;</i> substitution, if
you put it here, it will still work. You can go home and verify that, but I
will do it a different way now. I will say, let <i>w</i> = <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
then <i>dw</i> is equal to 2<i>r dr</i>. So if I come here, I can write it as <i>a&#963;</i>/4&#949;<sub>0</sub>.
I borrow a 2 top and bottom to make it <i>d</i>. <i>w</i> also goes from 0 to
infinity, but now I get (<i>w</i> + a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>3/2</sup>. Now this is
simple integral, <i>dx</i>/<i>x</i> + some number to some power is <i>x</i><sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1),
but n is now -3 over 2. So you get <i>a</i>&#963;/4&#949;<sub>0</sub>, divided by (<i>w</i>+<i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>-&frac12;</sup>,
divided by -&frac12;, which is -2 on the top, and that goes from infinity to 0. </p>
<p>So I'm not going to
do this much slower than this. This is the kind of integral that you can see
right away, or you can go and work out the details. This is something you
should do. If you have trouble with such integrals, then you should work
harder than people who don't have trouble with such integrals, because you
should be able to do <i>x</i><sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1), and know that n+1 is -&frac12;,
and when it comes upstairs, it becomes -2. Now if you look at this integral,
in the upper limit omega's infinity, you get 1 over infinity, which is 0. The
lower limit when omega is 0, you get 1/<i>a</i>, and that will cancel the <i>a</i>
here, and you will get &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>. So that's the final answer. So the
electric field of this infinite plane, if you look at it from the side, looks
like this. The &#963;/2&#949;<sub>0</sub>. So what do you notice about this one that's
interesting?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It doesn't depend
on the distance.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It doesn&#39;t fall with distance. No matter how far you go from this infinite
plane, the field is the same. Again, each part of it makes a contribution that
falls like 1 over distance squared. As you go further and further out, you
might think the field should get weaker, right? How could it not get weaker?
They're moving away from everything. At least with the line charge, it didn't
go weaker like 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, but it did get weaker. How can you go
further and further from a plane? You are going further away from everybody?
How could it not matter? Yes, any ideas? </p>
<p>For example, if you
go very close to the plane, what happens? If you go really close to the plane
what happens is, the field in each section here looks like this. Therefore the
part that's useful is very small. If you go further away, you get things like
that. Maybe it's a little weaker, but the part that's useful, this one, is
getting bigger. So by magic, these tendencies cancel in the end. It doesn't
depend on distance. Now unless you do the integral, you will not know it
doesn't depend on the distance, because you can give arguments for why it'll
get weaker, arguments for why it'll get stronger. The fact that it'll
precisely be independent of distance, you have to do the calculation. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What's the
negative sign?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Negative sign where, here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
-2 is there, but the upper limit is infinity.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
All right. Now here's the third problem, and the good news is, I'm not going
to solve it for you, but I'll tell you what it is. Here is a solid ball of
charge. It's got some charge density &#961; coulombs per meter cubed. So &#961; is the
standard name. You use density for mass over volume and you use the same
symbol rho for charge per unit volume. So somebody's assembled a blob of
electrical charge, and 1 cubic meter of that has &#961; coulombs. You want to find
the field due to this one. Now when you do a similar problem in gravitation,
it is generally assumed that when you're outside the sphere, the whole sphere
acts like a point charge with the entire charge sitting at the center. But you
actually have to prove that. </p>
<p>That's what took
Newton a long time to prove. He knew it was true but he couldn't prove it,
because for that, you've got to be able to do integral calculus. And even
today, to find the field due to a sphere using integration is quite difficult.
Think about what you have to do. You want to sit somewhere here. First of
all, for a sphere, we know the field is going to be radial. It doesn't matter
where you pick, everything looks the same. You can decide to be horizontally
here at that point. Then you've got to divide the sphere into tiny pieces,
tiny little cubes, each with some charge rho times the volume of the cube, and
that will exert a force like this. And you've got to integrate over the volume
of the sphere, but each portion is at a different distance and a different
angle. </p>
<p>You've got to add it
all up. That's why it's a tough problem. So to solve that tough problem,
we're now going to use a very powerful trick and that trick is called Gauss's
law. So we're going to learn today about the Gauss's law. Now a prelude to
that, you need a little more mathematical definitions, but they're not bad. I
just have to tell you what the definition is. Suppose I have in three
dimensions a tiny little area, like a snowflake, but it's flat and it's
rectangular, let's say. I want to tell you everything about it. I want you to
be able to visualize the area. What can I do to specify this little thing?
First I have to tell you how big it is. If it's a tiny area, let this area be <i>dA</i>
meters squared, but that doesn't tell me the orientation of this area, because
that area could be like this, it could be like this, it could be tilted in many
ways. So I want to tell you it's an area in a certain plane, what should I
do? How do I nail down the plane in which the area is located? Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Define the vector
that's perpendicular to that surface.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Define a vector normal to that surface, because if you draw that vector, then
there's only one plane perpendicular to it. Then we can follow, we can then
form a vector, <i>dA</i>. It's a tiny vector whose direction is perpendicular
to its area and whose magnitude is the value of the area itself. So areas can
be associated with vectors. You may not have thought about it that way, but
you can by this process. I've told you, there's only one ambiguity even now.
Do you know what that one-- yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Which direction.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There are two normal's you can draw to an area, right? We've got an area like
this, it can come out towards you or go away from you. Therefore simply
drawing that rectangular patch is not enough to nail that. That&#39;s like saying,
&quot;Here is a vector.&quot; That's not enough. Where is the head and where
is the tail? That's not a vector. That is a vector. Similarly, this area has
to be specified some more and here is what you're supposed to do. You take
that area here, I'm just drawing it another place, draw some arrows, then circulate
around it in one sense or another. I picked a particular sense in which
they're going around. Then use the famous right hand rule, where your fingers
curl along the arrow and your thumb points in some direction, that is the
direction, the area of the vector. If the arrows are running round the
opposite way, then your thumb will point into the blackboard. </p>
<p>So an area like this
is like a vector without a head. Area like this is a signed area. It's an
area that&#39;s got a magnitude and unique direction. So get used to the notion
that a tiny planar area can be represented as a vector. Another way to see
that is, if you took any area, a rectangular area like this--square is a
special case--if you took two vectors <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> that form the two
edges, then <i>A</i> x <i>B</i> is just double the area. It's the fact that
given two vectors, I can find the third vector perpendicular to them, up to a sign,
is what makes a cross product possible, only in three dimensions. You cannot
have a cross product of two vectors and four dimensions because in four
dimensions, if I pick two vectors, they'll be two other directions
perpendicular to that plane. Only in 3D, there's only one direction left. </p>
<p>The question is, is
it in or out? That you pick a sign in the cross product, <i>A</i> x <i>B</i>
is something that goes from A to B. Or for an area, you draw arrows around the
edge in a certain direction. So area is a vector. You have to get used to that
notion, along with all the other vectors you know. Now I'll tell you why that
becomes useful. So we're going to take--let's see--there is a rectangular tube
which has got a height <i>h</i> and a width <i>w</i>, and some fluid is flowing
along the tube with the velocity <i>v</i> along the length of the tube. You
got that? It's like an air duct. Stuff is going through that tube. It's got
a rectangular cross section. The cross section area is <i>hw</i>. If the fluid
is going velocity <i>V</i> along the length of the tube, what is the flow rate,
which is equal to meter cubed of stuff flowing per second. I'm going to denote
it by the symbol &#934;. If I wait 1 second
and I watch all the fluid go by me, past any cross section, how much stuff goes
by? </p>
<p>I think you can all
see, if I wait 1 second, the fluid whose front was here would have advanced to here,
and the volume here will be <i>v</i> times 1, because in 1 second, it goes a
distance <i>v</i>. So the flow rate will be <i>hwv</i> or area times <i>v</i>.
That makes sense? The faster it's going, the more stuff you get. The bigger
the cross section, the more stuff you get. This doesn't depend on a
rectangular cross section. It can be cylindrical pipe carrying oil. Again, the
flow rate is area times velocity. But I'm going to write this in terms of
vectors, because I know the velocity is a vector. But now I have also learned
area is a vector, because area vector here, you can draw a vector perpendicular
to this area, and I'll draw up this convention that it's area vectors along
this way, rather than the other way. Then I can write this <i>v</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>A</i>. </p>
<p>Let's check that <i>v</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>A</i>is correct. <i>v</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>A</i> is the length of <i>v</i>,
the size of <i>v</i>, the size of <i>A</i>and cosine of the angle between
them. Here we've got to be very careful. The velocity vector is like this.
It's perpendicular to the plane but don't say it's cosine of 90 degrees. The area
vector is perpendicular to the area itself. Do you understand that? When I
take the dot product and I will ask for the angle between the area vector and
the velocity vector, that angle is 0. For the area, there's a little
confusion. The vector representing it happens to be perpendicular to the plane
of the area itself. So if you remember that, then <i>v</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>A</i>is <i>vA</i> times
cos 0, so this indeed is one way to write the flow. This flow is also called a
flux. But now let us do the following. Let's take the same problem, and I
have this area here. </p>
<p>Let me now take a
tilted area like this. It also goes from the ceiling to the floor but still
turned at an angle <i>&#952;</i>. So it's a bigger area than the original one. How
much bigger? That area prime, I claim, is equal to the base <i>w</i>, times
this side. This side is <i>h</i>/cos<i>&#952;</i>. <i>&#952;</i> is the angle between
these two planes. It's a bigger area, but you all know that just because it's
a bigger area, it doesn't intercept more fluid per second. Any stuff crossing
this guy also crosses this at the same rate. So how am I going to get the same
rate? The flux is not going to be <i>v</i> times <i>A</i>&#39;. It's going to be <i>vA&#39;</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>.
But <i>&#952;</i> is the angle between the area vector and the velocity vector,
which is the same angle here. So the moral of the story is, <i>v</i>&#8901;<i>A&#39;</i>, or <i>v</i>&#8901;<i>A</i> in general is the
flux or the flow, off of any vector across an area. If it's a fluid that's
flowing, then <i>v</i>&#8901;<i>A</i> is the fluid flow
past that area. </p>
<p>If you need the dot
product, you need the cosine of the angle, because the area, if it's not
perpendicular to the flow, it's not useful. In fact, you can take a huge area
parallel to the flow and nothing goes through it. So area is most effective if
the plane of the area is normal to the fluid, or the area vector is parallel to
the velocity of the fluid. So that's that lesson. Okay, this had nothing to
do with the electric field, but we're going to come to the electric field now.
This is just a warm up. Let's come to the electric field and see what's going
on. So I take a charge <i>q</i> and I draw the lines coming out of it. How
many lines do I get crossing a sphere <i>S</i>? Well, we know that we have
agreed to draw 1/&#949;<sub>0</sub> lines per coulomb, so this <i>q</i> here, that
many lines cross the sphere. I'm now going to relate it to something I can do
with the electric field as follows. </p>
<p>I'm going to say that
if I go to that sphere, I look at the electric field. Electric field is in
that direction, <i>E</i>. And any portion of the sphere--and I want this is
where you got to __________ imagine--take a tiny part of the sphere. There's a
tiny area that's got a size <i>dA</i>. What is its direction? Direction of
the area vector is radial. You understand? The area is on the surface and
normal to that is the radial vector, which I always denote by <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>.
The electric field is equal to <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>(1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>)<i>E</i><sub>r</sub>.
Therefore <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i> = <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>(1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>)dA<i>e<sub>r</sub></i>&#8901;<i>e<sub>r</sub></i>. This is a dot
product of the area vector with the electric field vector. The two unit
vectors are parallel. The dot product of that guy with itself is just 1. So
this is the number of lines crossing the tiny area, because electric field
numerically is equal to the line density. </p>
<p>So those lines
crossing this area, this is the number of lines crossing that patch, which is
given by <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i>. If you add up all
the lines, you must add up all the <i>dA</i>s. Sum of all the <i>dA</i>s on a
sphere of radius <i>r</i> is just <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i> times
sum of all the <i>dA</i>s on a sphere, that is just 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i> .
So you get <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. In other words, either you can draw
the picture and it's immediately obvious to you the lines crossing is <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>
by construction, or you can remember, &quot;Hey, the electric field is a direct
measure of the number of lines per unit area,&quot; and the electric field
times area times the cosine of the angle between the area and the electric
field will count the lines going through a tiny area. If I add them all up,
I'd better get <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, and indeed you do. So the moral
of this little exercise is that </p>
<p>the surface integral,
let's call it the surface integral of the electric field, on a surface is equal
to <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> where this was a sphere. In other words, even
if you've never heard of field lines, just take the electric field and do the
surface integral, you get this. So surface integral is a new concept. You
probably have not done that before and I've got to remind you how it is done at
least operationally. If you've got a computer, you can find the surface
integral of anything as follows. Take the surface over which you're doing an
integration. Divide it into tiny pieces, each is a little area <i>dA</i>.
Take the dot product of the <i>dA</i> with the electric field there, and sum
over all the patches covering the sphere. Then take the limit in which every
patch gets vanishingly small. </p>
<p>That is called the
surface integral of the electric field and we see that if you do that, you get
the charge inside divided by <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. But that was on a sphere,
and the interesting thing was, the answer was independent of the radius of the
sphere, because the 1/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> in the field canceled the <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
in the area. But it is even better than that, because it's clear to you know,
without any calculation, that if I took some crazy surface like this, the lines
crossing that is also the same. Because the lines leave the origin, they go
radially outwards. They don't terminate on anything. They're only supposed to
terminate on other charges, therefore you can count them anywhere you like. You
can take a census here, you can take a census there or there. You're always
going to get the same number of lines. </p>
<p>Therefore <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0
</sub></i>is also going to be equal to the line count on some weird surface
enclosing the charge. So how am I going to count the lines on a weird
surface? I take the surface, divide it into little pieces, but now the area
vector and the electric field vector may not be parallel, because it's not a
sphere. But it is still true that if you're trying to count the lines going
through, just like in the velocity, you must take the dot product of these.
Therefore you will again find <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i> for any surface, any closed surface, is equal to <i>q</i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0
</sub></i>. If you got lost in the mathematics, the physical picture is very
clear. If you want to count how many lines leave the charge, you can surround
it with any surface you like. If it's a sphere, it's very easy for you to do
the check. If it's a crazy surface, it's harder but they all come from the
fact that <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i>, count the number of
lines and that's independent of the surface at stake. </p>
<p>So now that it what
is called Gauss's law, so I'm going to write it down here. What I've shown you
is the following. Here is some strange closed surface that's a charge <i>q</i>
inside. Then <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i>on that surface is
equal to <i>q</i><sub>inside</sub><b>/</b><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. This is not
yet the theorem, but this is the case for 1 charge. If the charge were
outside, suppose the charge were here, then the lines would go like this, and
the total number leaving the surface would actually be 0. You might say,
&quot;How is that? I see all these lines penetrating the surface,&quot; but
you've got to remember, if you take an area vector here, with the definition
for a closed surface, the area vector is the outward pointing normal. For a
closed surface, every area is a vector pointing out from the closed surface.
Then you can see that in this surface, lines are coming out; on this surface,
lines are going in. It's very clear what's going in is coming out, because
nothing is terminating. Therefore if you took a surface that did not enclose
the charge, this answer would be 0, but if it enclosed the charge, it will be
the charge inside, but it won't matter where it is. </p>
<p>You can also see that
you can move this charge around anywhere you like, you don't change the number
of lines coming out. Then the most important generalization is, if instead of
1 charge, I have 2 charges, what do you do? If you had 2 charges, let us take
the total <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i>on a surface. The
total electric field is the electric field due to the first charge on that
surface, + the electric field due to the second charge on the surface, thanks
to superposition. It's the fact that the electric field is additive over
charges. But this one is <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. This is <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>.
Therefore, we can now write, generalizing to any number, whether one draws a
double integral with this thing, meaning it's a closed surface. You can also
have an open surface, take the skin off an orange and cut it in half. </p>
<p>That hemispherical
skin is also a surface, but to signify it's a closed surface, we do it like
this. On a closed surface of <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i>= <i>q<sub>enclosed</sub></i>/<i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, which
means sum of all the <i>q</i>&#39;s. And sometimes we write this as follows.
Suppose inside you don't have a discrete set of charges that you can count, but
a continuous blob of charge, and the charge has a certain density, &#961; is the
charge density. What is the <i>q</i><sub>enclosed</sub>? I claim the answer is
due to a volume integral of &#961; or any point <i>r </i>inside, times <i>dxdydz</i>
inside that volume. You know, if you want to say how many coulombs are there,
well divide the volume into tiny cubes of size <i>dxdydz</i>. That times the &#961;
of <i>r</i>, meaning &#961; at <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>, is the charge inside
the cube. You add it all up, you get the charge enclosed in that funny shaped
object. </p>
<p>So this is the final
form of Gauss's law that we're going to use. I'm going to use the symbol,
which is very useful. This is the theorem of Gauss. And S = DV. DV is the
boundary of V. In other words, V is like a potato, the skin of the potato is
DV. Therefore if the potato is full of charge, it will emit some electric flux
and the surface integral electric flux over the skin of the potato is the
charge enclosed inside it. The charge enclosed inside it is not simply some
constant density times volume, if the charge density varies from point to
point. In each neighborhood inside their volume, you take a tiny section, a
tiny little cube of size <i>dxdydz</i>, see how much is in there, as the
function of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>, and you do the integral over the
volume. Now these integrals may be hard to do, but you should know at least
what I'm saying. This is just a way of counting the total charge inside a volume
when the charge is continuously distributed. </p>
<p>So I'm going to show
you one application of this and we'll come back to more next time. And the one
application I'm going to show you is to find the electric field due to a solid
ball, solid ball of charge. So I'm going to use Gauss's theorem to do that.
This is true for any surface you pick. It doesn't matter what surface you
pick. So if I want to find the electric field here, I'm going to pick a
surface of radius little <i>r</i>. Let the sphere have a radius big <i>R</i>.
I want to find the field here and I'm going to use Gauss's law. So on the left
hand side and the right hand side are two different things. On the right hand
side, what is the charge enclosed? That region. Well, the charge enclosed is
just some number <i>q</i>. This whole thing is <i>q</i>, <i>q</i> spread over
a sphere of radius <i>r</i>, over <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. That's going to be the surface integral of the electric field on that
sphere. <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dA</i> on that sphere. </p>
<p>Now normally, if you
knew the value of an integral over a region, you cannot deduce anything but the
integrand, unless what? There's one exception where if you know the integral
of a function, you can find the integrand. You know when that might be?
Here's a function. I tell you its integral from here to here, but I don&#39;t show
you the picture. What's the integrand? You don't know. But if I also tell
you the function is a constant, and I tell you the integral, and you know the
width of this region, you can find the integrand. So you're going to cook this
up so that this whole integral is a constant times the area of integration.
And we argue that if you've got a spherical charge density, the electric field
must be radial everywhere. </p>
<p>You've not proven
this, but you argue that because it's the only distribution with lines coming
out everywhere, invariant under every possible rotation of the sphere. Because
if you rotate the sphere, I won't know you rotated it, so the field pattern
cannot look different. If the field pattern looked different when you rotated
it, then you have a problem because the cause looks the same, but the effect
looks different. That's not allowed. The only allowed this is the radially
outgoing electric field. Therefore the electric field is radial and also
constant throughout the sphere, because all points on the sphere are
equivalent. There's no reason why this is any better than that. The sphere
looks the same for all directions. </p>
<p>Therefore this whole
integral is going to be 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i> times the electric field at that
radius <i>r</i>, because the area vector and the electric field vector are both
parallel, so in this dot product, forget the dot product. It's just <i>E</i>
times <i>dA</i>. There's no cos<i>&#952;</i>, just 1. You can pull the <i>E</i>
out of the integral, because <i>E</i> is constant in magnitude on the sphere.
And the integral of the <i>dA</i> is just 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>. Therefore
you deduce <i>E</i>(<i>r</i>) is <i>q</i>/4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
It's a very profound result. It looks very simple, but it is true for not a
point charge, but for the spherical distribution of charge. That the field
goes like that of a point charge sitting at the origin, is a consequence of
Gauss's law. If the charge inside was not uniform, suppose it's a charge <i>q</i>,
but there's more stuff here, less stuff here, this theorem would still be true
up to this point, but you can never deduce that <i>E</i> is a constant on a
sphere, because even though a sphere is nice and symmetrical, the charge
distribution is not. </p>
<p>It could be big here,
it could be small here. You know something about the integral over a surface
of a varying function, then Gauss's law is no good, not useful. True, but not
useful. Gauss's law is useful only when in a given problem, there's only one
number you don't know. That number here happens to be, what's the strength of <i>E</i>
at a radius <i>r</i>? I know it's direction is radial, I know it's magnitude
is constant on the sphere by symmetry, but what is the number? You can trade
that one number for this one number on the left hand side, <i>q</i>/&#949;<sub>0</sub>,
you can calculate it. I'll come back and do more examples for you guys next
time. Okay, so see you next Wednesday.</p>
