<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> So, today we are going to do
something different from what's happened so far, in that we are going
to study the dynamics of more than one body. Well, you might say "Look,
we already did this last week, when I studied the Solar System," where
there are planets moving around the Sun so that makes at least two
bodies, the Sun and the planet. But actually, the Sun was not doing
anything interesting in our analysis. The Sun just stood there as a
source of the gravitational force. It's the planet that did all the
orbiting and that was the problem in two dimensions, but of only one
body. So now, we are going to enlarge our domain to more than one body
obeying Newton's laws.</p>

<p>So, let me start with the simplest possible case: two bodies. And I
will again start with the simplest case of their moving in one
dimension; then, we'll put in more. So, here is the one-dimensional
world in which these bodies are going to move, and this is my origin,
<i>x</i> = 0, and I'm going to imagine one point mass
<i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, located at <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, another point
mass <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, located at <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. Now, we
know everything there is to know about these masses from the laws of
Newton which I'm going to write down. The first mass obeys this
equation, <i>m<sub>1</sub>d<sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub>/
dt<sup>2</sup></i>. That's <i>ma</i>, right? But I'm going to write
this in a notation that's more succinct. I'm tired of writing the
second derivative in this fashion. I'm going to write it as follows,
<i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub></i>, with two dots on it; the two dots
telling you it's two derivatives, because one dot is one derivative,
three dots is three derivatives. Of course, at some point this notation
becomes unwieldy, but you never deal with more than two derivatives, so
this works. This is <i>ma</i>, so don't forget the dots, okay? This is
not some foreign alphabet. Every dot is a derivative. You should
remember that when I do subsequent manipulation. That's <i>ma</i>, and
that's equal to force on body 1, <i>F<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, look at the body one and ask, "What are the forces acting on
it?" Well, it could be the whole universe. But we're going to divide
that into two parts. The first part is going to be the force on body 1
due to body 2, which I'm going to denote by <i>F<sub>12</sub></i>;
that's our notation. You and I agree that it's the force on 1 due to 2.
Then, there's the force on 1 due to the external world; <i>e</i> stands
for external. That means everything outside these two. So, the universe
has many bodies; I have just picked these two guys. They're 1 and 2,
and the force on 1 is--some of it's due to 2, and some of it's due to
everything else.</p>

<p>Similarly, I have another equation,
<i>m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i> double dot is the force on 2 due to 1
plus the force on 2 due to the outside world. What do you mean by
"outside world"? Maybe these two guys are next to some planet, and the
planet's way over to the right, it's pulling all of them towards the
planet with some gravitational force. So, everything else is called
"external." And I have 1 and 2, for example, are connected by a spring.
The spring is not that important. It's a way of transmitting force from
one body to the other. If you compress the spring and let it go, these
two masses will vibrate back and forth under the influence of the other
person's force. That's an example of <i>F<sub>12</sub></i> and
<i>F<sub>21</sub></i>. For example, if the spring is compressed at this
instant, it's trying to push them out; that means, really, 1 is trying
to push 2 out, whereas that way 2 is trying to push 1 to the left, this
way. That's an example of <i>F<sub>12</sub></i> and
<i>F<sub>21</sub></i>.</p>

<p>The external force could be due to something extraneous to these two
bodies. So, one example is at the surface of the Earth. I take these
two masses connected by a spring. Here is mass 1 and here's mass 2. I
squash the spring. If there is no gravity, they will just go vibrating
up and down but let them fall into the field of gravity, so they're
also experiencing the <i>mg</i> due to gravity. So, they will both fall
down and also oscillate a little with each other. They're all described
by this equation. This will be the spring force transmitted from 1 to
2. This will be the force of gravity, or it could be an electric force
or any other force due to anything else; we are not interested.</p>

<p>Now, here is the interesting manipulation we're going to perform. We
are going to add the two things on the left-hand side and equate them
to whatever I get on the right-hand side. Then,
<i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub></i> double dot plus
<i>m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i> double dot, and that's going to
be--I'm going to write it in a particular way, <i>F<sub>1e</sub> +
F<sub>2e</sub> + F<sub>12</sub> + F<sub>21</sub></i>. I think you have
some idea of where I'm headed now. So, what's the next thing we could
say? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> <i>F<sub>12</sub> + F<sub>21</sub></i> = 0.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, because that's the Third
Law of Newton. Whatever the underlying force, gravity, spring,
anything, force on 1 due to 2, and force on 2 due to 1 will cancel, and
everything I get today, the whole lecture is mainly about this one
simple result, this cancellation. Then, this whole thing, I'm going to
write as <i>F<sub>e</sub></i>, meaning the total external force on this
two-body system. So, I have this peculiar equation. I'm going to
rewrite it in a way that brings it to the form in which it's most
useful. I'm going to introduce a new guy, capital <i>X</i>. As you
know, that's called a center of mass coordinate, and it's defined as
<i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i> divided
by capital <i>M</i>. Capital <i>M</i> is just the total mass,
<i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i>. If I do that, this is a
definition. Then, we can write this equation as follows. I will write
it and then we can take our time seeing that it is correct. So, this is
really the big equation. Why don't you guys try to fill in the blanks
in your head? This is really correct. On the left-hand side, I have
<i>M</i> times <i>X</i> double dot, so I have really <i>m<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>X</i> double dot. If you take the double dot
of this guy, it's <i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub></i> double dot plus
<i>m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i> double dot, divided by
<i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i>. So, the left-hand side is indeed
this; that's all I want you to check. So, take this expression, divide
by the total mass and multiply by the total mass. Well, the multiplying
by the total mass is here, and when you divide by the total mass you
get the second derivative of the center of mass coordinate.</p>

<p>So what have I done? I have introduced a fictitious entity, the
center of mass. The center of mass is a location <i>X</i>, some kind of
a weighted average of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. By
weighted, I mean if <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> are
equal, then capital <i>M</i> will be two times that mass and you'll
just get <i>x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub></i> over 2. The center of
mass will sit right in between. But if <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> is heavier,
it'll be tilted towards <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>; if <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>
is heavier, it'll be tilted towards <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>. It's a
weighted sum that gives a certain coordinate. There is nothing present
at that location. There's nobody there. All the stuff is either here or
there. The center of mass is the location of a mathematical entity.
It's not a physical entity. If you go there and say, "What's at the
center of mass?" you typically won't find anything. And it behaves like
a body. After all, if you just said, "I've learned Newton's laws," and
I walk into this room and I say this, you will say "Well, this guy's
talking about a body of mass, capital <i>M</i>, undergoing some
acceleration due to the force." So, the center of mass is the body
whose mass seems to be the total mass of these two particles, whose
acceleration is controlled by the same as Newton's law, but the
right-hand side contains only the external forces; this is the key. All
the internal forces have canceled out, and what remains is the external
force.</p>

<p>Now it turns, if you've got three bodies, you can do a similar
manipulation. And again, you'll have <i>F<sub>12</sub></i> and
<i>F<sub>23</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>32</sub></i> and so on. They will
cancel and what will remain will be a similar thing, but this is the
total external force. So, if I can say this in words, what we have
learned is that the advantage of introducing a quantity called "center
of mass" is that it responds only to the total force; it doesn't care
about internal forces.</p>

<p>So, I'll give an example. Here is some airplane, right? It's in
flight, and a couple of guys are having a fight, punching each other
and so on. The rest of the passengers say "enough is enough" and they
throw them out. So, they're just floating around, affecting each
other's dynamics, and of course this person will feel a force due to
that person, that person will feel a force due to this person, but what
I'm telling you is the center of mass is going to drop like a rock.
It's going to accelerate with the force <i>mgh</i>; it's going to
accelerate with <i>g</i>. So, at one point this person may be having
the upper hand and may be here, and the other person may be down here,
but follow the center of mass and you'll find it simply falls under
gravity. So, the mutual forces do not affect the dynamics of the center
of mass. Or, for example, suppose at some point, this person blows the
other one up into, say, it's a samurai bat, make it simple, cuts him up
in two pieces, so now we've got three bodies now: the first protagonist
and the other two now, unfortunately somewhat decimated. Now, you can
take these three bodies, find their center of mass; it'll be the same
thing; it'll just keep falling down. So, even though the system is
becoming more and more complicated, you cannot change the dynamics of
the center of mass. It responds only to the external force. If this
fight was taking place in outer space where there's no gravity, then as
this fight continues and people are flying and parts are flying
everywhere, the center of mass will just be in one location, not doing
anything. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Couldn't the internal forces change the center of
mass's location?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, that's what I'm saying. The
center of mass, if it changes it can certainly-- No one says the center
of mass cannot accelerate. It can accelerate due to external forces.
But if there were no external forces, then the center of mass will
behave like a particle with no force. If it's not moving to begin with,
it won't move later. Or if it is moving to begin with, it'll maintain a
constant velocity.</p>

<p>So, here's another example. Now you can obviously generalize this to
more than one dimension. If you're living in two dimensions, you will
introduce an <i>x</i> coordinate and introduce a <i>y</i> coordinate
and then you will have the center of mass as <i>MR</i> double dot
equals <i>F</i>, and <i>R</i> would be <i>m<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub></i> divided by the total mass;
<i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> are just the location now
in two dimensions of these two masses. So, here is <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>
and here is <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> and the center of mass you can check
will be somewhere in between the line joining the two points, but it'll
now be a vector.</p>

<p>So here's another example. You take a complicated object; it's got
masses and it's got springs; it's connected with thread, and chains and
everything. You throw the whole mess into the air. All the different
parts of it are jiggling and doing complicated movements, but if you
follow the center of mass, in other words at every instant you take the
<i>m<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>r<sub>2</sub> +
m<sub>3</sub>r<sub>3</sub></i> and so on, divided by the total mass,
that coordinate will simply be following the parabolic path of a body
curving under gravity. If at some point this complicated object
fragments into two chunks, one will land here and one will land there.
But at every instant, if you follow the center of mass, it'll go as if
nothing happened and it will land here. The center of mass does not
care about internal forces, only about external forces. That's the main
point. And it was designed in such a way that external [correction:
should have said "internal"] forces canceled in these dynamics. So,
everything I'm going to do today is to take that equation, <i>MX..=
F</i> or <i>MR..= F</i>, in vector form, and deduce some of the
consequences.</p>

<p>Now, first of all, you should realize that if you've got several
bodies, say three bodies, then I will define the center of mass to be
<i>m<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub></i> divided by the sum of
<i>m<sub>i</sub></i>. This is a shorthand, I'm going to write it only
once, but you should know what the notation means. If there is <i>i</i>
from 1 to 3, it really means <i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>3</sub>x<sub>3</sub></i> divided by
<i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>3</sub></i>. This summation is
the notation mathematicians have introduced where the index <i>i</i>
will go over a range from 1 to 3. Every term you let <i>i</i> take
three different values and you do the sum. An exercise I've given to
you guys to pursue at home is the following: if I got three bodies, 1,
2 and 3, you've defined the center of mass, you can either go to this
formula, do all the <i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub></i>'s and add them
up, or you also have the following option. You can pick any two of
them, say the first two -- forget the third one -- take these two, find
their center of mass, let's call it <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> and with that total mass <i>M<sub>12</sub></i>,
which is just <i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i>, trade these two for
a new fictitious object and put that here, and forget these two. But on
that one point it deposits the mass of these two; now, you take the
center of mass of this object with the third object, by the same
weighting process, <i>m<sub>3</sub>x<sub>3</sub> +
M<sub>12</sub>X<sub>12</sub></i> divided by the total mass; you'll get
the same answer as here.</p>

<p>What I'm telling you is, if you've got many bodies and you want the
center of mass of all of them, you can take a subset of them, replace
them by their center of mass, namely, all their mass sitting at their
center of mass, replace the other half by their mass sitting at their
center of mass, and finally find the center of mass of these two
centers of mass, properly weighted, and that'll give you this
result.</p>

<p>Okay, so, before I exploit that equation and find all the
consequences, we have to get used to finding center of mass for a
variety of things, as long as they give you ten masses, or a countable
number of masses, we've just got to plug it in here; it's a very
trivial exercise. Things become more interesting if I give you not a
set of discrete masses but discrete locations, namely, a countable set
of masses, but I give you a rod like this. This is a rod of mass
<i>M</i> and length <i>L</i>, and I say: "Where is the center of mass?"
So, we have to adapt the definition that we have for this problem.</p>

<p>So, what should I do? Well, this is my origin of coordinates. If I
had a set of masses with definite locations I know how to do it, but
this is a continuum. The trick then is to say, I take a distance
<i>x</i> from the left hand, and I cut myself a very thin sliver of
taking this <i>dx</i>. That sliver has got a certain mass, and I argue
it's at a definite distance <i>x</i> from the coordinate's origin. And
if you're nitpicking you will say, "What do you mean by definite
distance?" It's got a width <i>dx</i>, so one part of it is at
<i>x</i>, the other part is at <i>x + dx</i> so it doesn't have a
definite coordinate. But if <i>dx</i> is going to 0, this argument will
eventually be invalid. So <i>dx</i> goes to 0, sliver has a definite
location, which is just the <i>x</i> coordinate of where I put it. So,
to find the center of mass, which consists of multiplying every mass by
its location and adding--Let me first find how much mass is sitting
here. Let me call it <i>δm</i>. How much mass is sitting there? Well, I
do the following. I take the total mass and divide it by <i>L</i>;
that's the mass per unit length. And this fellow has a width <i>dx</i>,
so the mass of this little sliver is <i>(M/L) dx</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the center of mass that I want is found by taking this
sliver of that mass, multiplying by its coordinate and summing over all
the slivers, which is what we do by the integral from 0 to <i>L</i>.
Then, I should divide by the total mass, which is just <i>M</i>. You
can see now if you do this calculation. I get 1/<i>L</i>; then, I get
integral <i>xdx</i> from 0 to <i>L</i>, and that's going to be
<i>L<sup>2</sup></i> over 2. So, if you do that you'll get <i>L</i>/2.
I'm not doing every step in the calculus because at this point we
should be able to do this without every detail. So, the center of mass
of this rod, to nobody's surprise, is right in the midpoint, but it
assumes that the rod is uniform, whereas [if its] like a baseball bat,
thicker at one end and thinner at the other end, of course no one is
saying that, but we have assumed the mass per unit length, namely
<i>M</i> or is this a fixed number, <i>M/L</i>, and then this is the
answer.</p>

<p>But there are other ways to get this result without doing all the
work, okay? So, we would like to learn that other method because it'll
save you a lot of time. It must be clear to most people that the center
of mass of this rod is at the center. But how do we argue that? How do
you make it official? If you do the integral you will get the answer,
but I want to short circuit the integral. And here is a trick. It's not
going to work for arbitrary bodies. If I give you some crazy object
like this, you cannot do anything. But this is a very symmetric object;
you can sort of tell if I take the midpoint. There is as much stuff to
the right as to the left and somehow you want to make that argument
formal, and you do the following.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a bunch of masses, and the object's really not even
regular, and this is my origin of coordinates. If I replace every
<i>x</i> by <i>-x</i>, okay--sorry, I should change this object, so
this really looks like this. Here's the object. Suppose I replace every
<i>x</i> by <i>-x</i> that's reflecting the body around this axis, it
will look like this; it'll be jutting to the right instead of the left.
So, don't go by my diagrams. You know what I'm trying to do. I'm trying
to draw the mirror image of this object the other way. Then, I think
it's clear to everybody, if I do that, <i>X</i> will go to <i>-X</i>,
because in this averaging <i>m<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub></i>, sum of all
the masses, if every <i>x</i> goes to <i>-x</i> the center of mass will
go to <i>-X</i>. But now, take this rod and transport every particle to
its negative coordinate. And you take that guy and put it here, the rod
looks the same. If the rod looks the same, the center of mass must look
the same. That means <i>-xX</i> has to be equal to <i>x</i> itself and
the only answer is <i>X</i> = 0. So, without doing any detailed
calculation, you argue that the answer is <i>X</i> = 0.</p>

<p>To do this, of course, you must cleverly pick your coordinates so
that the symmetry of the body is evident. If you took the body like
this and you took a reflection around this point, it goes into body
flipped over. There is not much you can say about it. So, what you
really want to do is to pick a point of reflection so that upon
reflection the body looks the same; the body looks the same, the answer
must be the same. But if you argue the answer must be minus of itself,
therefore the answer is 0. This is how the center of mass of symmetric
bodies can be found. So, we know the answer for this rod.</p>

<p>Suppose I give you not a thin rod, but a rod of non-0 width. We want
to know its center of mass; we're not going to do any more work now. By
symmetry, I can argue that this has to be the center of mass, because I
can take every point here and turn it into the point there by changing
<i>y</i> to <i>-y</i>; therefore, capital <i>Y</i> will become minus
capital <i>Y</i>, but the body looks the same after this mapping. So,
capital <i>Y</i> is 0, and similarly capital <i>X</i> is 0, and that's
the center of mass.</p>

<p>Okay, now, what if I give you this object, anybody want to try that?
Would you guys like to try this? Yes, can you tell me where the center
of mass should be, yeah? No, no, the guy in front of you, yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The center of mass, you can't get the center of mass
with two objects, and then this is where you said over in the curve,
find the center between those two masses.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, is that what your answer
was? Okay, so the correct answer is, replace this mass by all of its
mass, whatever it is, sitting here. Replace this one by all of its mass
sitting here; then, forget the big bodies, replace them by points.
Then, he's got two masses located here, and you can find the weighted
average. It may be somewhere there.</p>

<p>Okay, now let's take one more object. Then I'm pretty much done with
finding these centers of mass. The object I'm going to pick is a
triangle that looks like this; it's supposed to be symmetric, even
though I've drawn it this way. That is <i>b</i> and that is <i>b</i>,
and that distance is <i>h</i>; let the mass be <i>M</i>. Where is the
center of mass of this object? Again, by symmetry, you can tell that
the <i>y</i> coordinate of the center of mass must lie on this line,
because if I take <i>y</i> to <i>-y</i>, it maps onto itself so it
looks the same. But it's supposed to reverse capital <i>Y</i>;
therefore, <i>Y</i> is <i>-Y</i> and therefore it's 0; so, it's
evidently lying somewhere on this line. I cannot do further
calculations of this type by saying where it is on the line, because it
has no longer a symmetry in the <i>x</i> direction; it's symmetric on
the <i>y</i> after flipping <i>y</i>, but I cannot take <i>x</i> to
<i>-x</i>. In fact, if I take <i>x</i> to <i>-x</i> this one looks like
this, it doesn't map into itself. But I can pick any point here; if I
take <i>x</i> to <i>-x</i>, the object looks different. It looks like
that object and relating one object to another object is what I'm
trying to do. I want to relate it to the same object. That cannot be
done for <i>x</i>. It can be done for <i>y</i>; for <i>x</i> you've got
to do some honest work.</p>

<p>The honest work we will do then is to take this thing, take a strip
here, with location <i>x</i> and width <i>dx</i>, and the height of
that strip here is <i>y</i>; <i>y</i> of course varies with <i>x</i>.
So, I'm going to argue that to find the center of mass of this triangle
I can divide it into vertical strips which are parallel to each other,
and find the center of mass by adding the weighted average of all these
things. For that, I need to know what's the mass of the shaded region.
So, let's call it <i>δm</i>. The mass of the shaded region is the mass
per unit area. I'll find the area later on in terms of <i>b</i> and
<i>h</i>, but this is mass per unit area. Then, I need to know the area
of the strip. I'm going to give the answer because I don't have time to
probe it. But you should think about what the answer for the area of
the shaded region is. It's got a height 2<i>y</i>, and it's got the
width <i>dx</i>. It's not quite a rectangle because the edges are
slightly tapered, but when <i>δx</i> goes to 0, it's going to look like
a rectangle. So, the area is 2<i>yδx</i>. But I don't want to write
everything in terms of <i>y</i>. I want to write it in terms of
<i>x</i>; then, I do similar triangles. Similar triangles tell me that
<i>y/b</i> is <i>x/h</i>, namely, that triangle compared to that
triangle tells me <i>y/b</i> is <i>x/h</i>. Therefore, the <i>y</i>
here can be replaced by <i>bx/h</i>. So, that is the mass of the sliver
here, and its center is obviously here, so that is a mass there,
there's a mass there; I've got to do the weighted average of all of
them. So remember, I don't just integrate this over <i>x</i>; that
would just give me the mass of the body. I should multiply it by a
further <i>x</i> and then do the integral. So, what I really want to do
to find the center of mass <i>x</i>, is to take that mass I got,
<i>M/A</i>, there is a 2, there's an <i>h</i>, there is a <i>b</i>,
there is an <i>x</i> from there, and another <i>x</i>, because you have
to multiply this by the <i>x</i> coordinate of this thing, because
that's the coordinate of the center of mass of this. There are two
<i>x</i>s, that's what you've got to remember. So, that should be
integrated from 0 to <i>h</i>, that'll give me <i>h<sup>3</sup></i>/3.
So, I get <i>(2Mb/Ah)</i> times <i>h<sup>3</sup></i> over 3.</p>

<p>Now, you know there is one more thing we have to do. We must replace
the area of the triangle by ½ base times altitude, which is <i>bh</i>.
I also forgot to divide everything by the mass, because the center of
mass is this weighted average divided by the total mass, so I've got to
divide by 1/<i>M</i>. Well, I claim, if you do this and cancel
everything you will get the answer of 2/3<i>h</i>. Okay, so not
surprisingly the center of mass of this is not halfway to the other
end, but two-thirds of the way because it's top heavy; this side of it
is heavier.</p>

<p>This is the level of calculus you should be able to do in this
course, be able to take some body, slice it up in some fashion, and
find the location of the center of mass. You combine symmetry arguments
with actual calculation. For this sliver, by symmetry, you know the
center of mass is at the center, you don't waste your time, but then
when you add these guys there is no further symmetry you can use; you
have to do the actual work.</p>

<p>So, what have I done so far? What I've done is point out to you that
when you work with extended bodies, or more than one body, we can now
treat the entire body, replace the body by a single point for certain
purposes. The single point is called a center of mass, where it
imagines all the mass concentrated at the center of mass. So, you have
created a brand new entity which is fictitious. It has a mass equal to
total mass. It has a location equal to the center of mass, and it moves
in response to the total force. And it's not aware of internal forces,
and that's what we want to exploit. I already gave you a clue as to
what the implications are, but let me now take a thorough analysis of
this basic equation <i>MR..= F</i>. We're just going to analyze the
consequence. So there are several cases you can consider.</p>

<p><u>Case one</u>: <i>F</i> external not equal to 0. So, these are two
bodies subject to mutual force and to an outside force, but the
simplest example I've already given to you -- but I'll repeat it --
we're not going to do this in great detail. We all know, if I fire a
point mass like this, it will do that. What I'm now telling you is, if
I take a complex body made of 20,000 parts, all connected to each other
pushing and pulling, if you fling that crazy thing in the air it'll do
all kinds of gyrations and jiggling as it moves around. But if you
found its center of mass, the center of mass will follow simply a
parabola, because the external force on it is just <i>Mg</i>. So, it'll
be <i>MR..= mg</i> and that's just motion with constant acceleration in
the <i>y</i> direction, and it's just a projectile problem. And I
repeat once more, for emphasis, that if this object broke into two
objects, typically what'll happen is one will fly there and one will
land here, but at every instant if you found their center of mass you
will find it proceeds as if nothing happened. For example, if you have
an explosive device that blows them apart, and the pieces are all
flying, but that's just coming from one part of the piece pushing on
another part of the piece, but those forces are of no interest to us.
As far as the external force goes, it is still gravity so the center of
mass will continue traveling. Beyond that, I'm not going to do too much
with this thing. So let me now go to Case II.</p>

<p>Case II. If you want, case 2a. <i>F</i> external is equal to 0. What
does it mean if <i>F</i> external is 0? That means this is 0. That
means <i>MR.. = 0</i>, that means <i>MR.</i> is a constant because it's
not changing. Who is this <i>MR.</i>? What does it stand for? Well, it
looks like the following. If you take a single particle of mass
<i>m</i>, and velocity <i>x.</i>, we use the symbol <i>p</i>, maybe
I've never used it before in the course, and that's called the
momentum. The momentum of a body is this peculiar combination of mass
and velocity. In fact, in terms of momentum we may write Newton's law.
Instead of saying it's <i>mdv/dt</i>, which is <i>ma</i>, you can also
write it as <i>d</i> by <i>dt</i> of <i>mv</i>, because <i>m</i> is a
constant and you can take it inside the derivative, and that we can
write as <i>dp/dt</i>. Sometimes, instead of saying force is mass times
acceleration, people often say "force is the rate of change of
momentum." The rate at which the momentum of a body is changing is the
applied force. So, if I've not introduced to you the notion of
momentum, well, here it is. So, if you think about it that way, this
looks like the momentum of the center of mass, and we are told the
momentum of the center of mass does not change if there are no external
forces. But the momentum of the center of mass has a very simple
interpretation in terms of the parts that make up the center of mass;
let's see what it is.</p>

<p>Let's go back here. Remember, let me just take two bodies and you
will get the idea; it's <i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i>, which is
total <i>M</i>, and let's take just one dimension when it's
<i>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>.+ m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub>.</i> over
<i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i>; that is what <i>Mx.</i> is. So,
<i>m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></i> cancels here, and you find this is
just <i>p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub></i>. Let's use the symbol capital
<i>P</i> for momentum of the center of mass. So, the momentum of the
center of mass is the sum of the momentum of the two parts, but what
you're learning is -- so let me write it one more time -- if <i>F</i>
eternal is equal to 0, then <i>p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub></i> does
not change with time. This is a very, very basic and fundamental
property, and it's in fact another result that survives all the
revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics, where what I've said
for two bodies is true for ten bodies; you just do the summation over
more terms.</p>

<p>So, let me say in words what I'm saying. Take a collection of
bodies. At a given instant everything is moving; it's got its own
velocity and its momentum, add up all the momenta. If you had one
dimension, just add the numbers. If in two dimensions, add the vectors;
you get a total momentum. That total momentum does not change if there
are no outside forces acting on it. So, a classic example is two people
are standing on ice. Their total momentum is 0 to begin with, and the
ice is incapable of any force along the plane. It's going to support
you vertically against gravity, but if it's frictionless it cannot do
anything in the plane. Then, the claim is that if you and I are
standing and we push against each other and we fly apart, my momentum
has to be exactly the opposite of your momentum, because initially
yours plus mine was 0; that cannot change because there are no external
forces. If two particles are pushing against each other, they can only
do so without changing the total. Okay, so <i>p<sub>1</sub> +
p<sub>2</sub></i> does not change, and here's another context in which
it's important.</p>

<p>Suppose there is a mass <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, going with some
velocity <i>v<sub>1</sub></i>, and here's the second mass
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, going with some velocity <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>;
they collide. When they collide, all kinds of things can happen. I
mean, <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> may bump its head on that and come
backwards, or it could be a heavy object that pushes everything in the
forward direction, or at the end of the day you will have some
<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> going with a new velocity <i>v<sub>1</sub>'</i>,
and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> going with a new velocity
<i>v<sub>2</sub>'</i>. But what I'm telling you is that
<i>m<sub>1</sub> v<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> v<sub>2</sub></i> will
be equal to <i>m<sub>1</sub> v<sub>1</sub>' + m<sub>2</sub>
v<sub>2</sub>‘</i>. In a collision, of course, one block exerts a force
on the other block, and the other block exerts an opposite force on
this block, and that's the reason why even though individually the
momenta could be very different, finally the momenta will add up to the
same total. Here's a simple example; you can show that if this mass and
that mass are equal, and say this one is at rest, that one comes and
hits this. You can show under certain conditions this one will come to
rest and this will start moving with the speed of the--the target will
move at the speed of the projectile. So, momenta of individual objects
have changed. One was moving before, it is not moving; one was at rest,
it's moving, but when you add up the total, it doesn't change.</p>

<p>This is called the Law of Conservation of Momentum. So, that's so
important I'm just going to write it down here one more time. And the
basic result is, if external forces are 0, then <i>p<sub>1</sub> +
p<sub>2</sub> + p<sub>3</sub></i> and so on, "before" will be
<i>p<sub>1</sub>' + p<sub>2</sub>' + p<sub>3</sub>'</i>, and so on,
where this means "before" and that means "after," . When is "before"
and when is "after." Pick any two times in the life of these particles,
it's like Law of Conservation of Energy, where we said <i>E<sub>1</sub>
= E<sub>2</sub></i>, there 1 and 2 stood for "before" and "after."
Well, here we cannot use 1 and 2 for "before" and "after" because 1 and
2 and 3 are labeling particles. So, the "before" quantities are written
without a prime, and the "after" quantities are written with a
prime.</p>

<p>Everybody follow this? It's very important you follow this statement
and follow the conditions under which it's valid. There cannot be
external forces. For example, in the collision of these two masses, if
there is friction between the blocks and the table, you can imagine
they collide and they both come to rest after a while. Originally, they
had momentum and finally they don't. What happened? Well, here you have
an explanation, namely, the force of friction was an external force
acting on them. What I'm saying is that if the only force on each block
is the one due to each other, then the total momentum will not change.
So, the case that I considered, 2a, was external force equal to 0, but
center of mass was moving, because it had a momentum. Then, the claim
is that momentum will not change.</p>

<p>I'm coming to the last case, which is, if you want, case 2b. The
external forces are 0, the center of mass was 0; in other words, center
of mass was at rest. If you find these different cases complicated,
then I don't mind telling you one more time. The center of mass behaves
like a single object responding to the external force. It's clear that
if the external force is non-zero, the center of mass will accelerate.
If the external force is 0, the center of mass will not accelerate.
There are cases 1 and 2. 2a and 2b are the following: if it does not
accelerate, its velocity will not change. So then, you have the two
cases, it had a velocity, which it maintained, or it had no velocity,
in which case it does not even move. See, if you apply <i>F = ma</i> to
a body and there are no forces, you cannot say the body will be at
rest. You will say the body will maintain the velocity. So, if it had a
velocity, it'll go at the velocity, if it was at rest it'll remain at
rest; the same goes for the center of mass. If the center of mass was
moving, it'll preserve its momentum. That really means the sum of the
momenta of the individual pieces will be preserved. If it was at rest,
since the external force is 0, it will remain at rest. So, I want to
look at the consequence of this one. I could've done them in either
order. I can take the case where there's no external force, there is no
motion, or I chose to do with the opposite way, where I took the most
complicated case, where external force is not 0. Then, I took the case
where it is 0 but the center of mass was moving to begin with, and
therefore it has to keep moving no matter what. And the simplest case
is the center of mass was at rest; then, it's not moving now and it
will never move.</p>

<p>So, let me give an example of where the idea comes into play. We
looked at the planetary motion of the Sun and the Earth, and I said the
Earth goes around the Sun, so let's look at it a little later; there's
the Earth and the only force between the Earth and the Sun is the
mutual force of gravitation. Now, my question to you is, "Is this
picture of the Sun sitting here and the Earth moving around acceptable
or not in view of what I've said?" Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The Sun and Earth revolve around a mutual center of
gravity.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, that's the answer to the
problem. But what is wrong if I just say the Sun remains here and the
Earth goes in a circle, which is what we accepted last time?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The momentum of the Sun doesn't change, but it
changes in the momentum of the Earth.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's one way. Do you
understand what he said? He said the momentum of the Sun is not
changing. The momentum of the Earth is changing, so the total momentum
is changing. The total momentum cannot change, so that's not
acceptable. But in terms of center of mass, you can say something else,
yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The center of mass moves.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It moves, maybe you can tell me,
you cannot point out from there, but tell me which way you think it's
moving.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> In a circle.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, in the beginning it's
somewhere here. A little later it's there, a little later it's there,
so the center of mass would do this, if the picture I gave you last
time was actually correct. So, a Sun of finite mass staying at rest and
a planet orbiting around it is simply not acceptable, because the
center of mass is moving without external forces; that's not allowed.
Or as he said, the momentum is constantly changing, this guy has no
momentum, that guy has the momentum that points this way now and points
that way later. But look what I've said here: take 1 and 2 to be the
Earth and the Sun, it doesn't add up to the same number. So, we sort of
know what the answer should be. We know that the thing that cannot move
is not the Sun and it's not the Earth. It's the center of mass; that's
what cannot move. If originally it was at rest, it'll remain at rest.
So, the center of mass, if it cannot move, so let's start off the Sun
here, start off the Earth here, join them, the center of mass is
somewhere here. Actually, the Sun is so much more massive than the
Earth, the center of mass lies inside the Sun. But I'm taking another
Solar System where the Sun is a lot bigger than the Earth but not as
big as in our world, so I can show the center of mass here. That cannot
move. So, what that means is, a little later, if the planet is here and
I want to keep the center there, the Sun has to be here, and somewhat
later when the planet's there the Sun has to be here. So, what will
happen is, the Sun will go around on a circle of smaller radius, the
planet will go around on a circle of a bigger radius, always around the
center of mass. So, you've got this picture now, it's like a dumbbell,
asymmetric, big guy here, small guy here, fix that and turn it.</p>

<p>You get a trajectory for the Sun, and you get a trajectory for the
Earth on a bigger circle; the center remains fixed. So, if you apply
loss of gravity, I've given you a homework problem, you've got to be
careful about one thing. When you apply the Law of Gravity, you may
apply it to the Earth for example. Then, you will say the centripetal
acceleration <i>mv<sup>2</sup> /r</i> is the force of gravity. When you
do that calculation be careful; <i>v</i> is the velocity of the planet,
and when you do the <i>mv<sup>2</sup>/r</i>, the <i>r</i> you put will
be the distance to the center of mass from where you are. That'll be
the <i>mv<sup>2</sup>/r</i>. But when you equate that to the force of
gravity, the <i>Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, for that <i>r</i> it is the actual distance from
the Earth to the Sun that you should keep, because the force of gravity
is a function of the distance between the planets, not between the
planet and the center of mass. The actual force on the Earth is really
coming not from here but on the other side of this where the Sun is.
But luckily, at every instant, the Sun is constantly pulling it towards
the center of the circle. It's a very clever solution. The planet moves
around a circle. It has an acceleration towards the center, and
somebody's providing that force. ut that somebody is not at the center
but always on the other side of the line joining you to the center, so
you still experience a force towards the center. Under the action of
that force, you can show it'll have a circular orbit and you can take
some time in calculating now the relation between time period and
radius and whatnot. So, this is called a two-body problem. So, this is
one example where you realize, "Hey, center of mass, if I follow it, it
cannot be moving and therefore the actual motion of planets is more
complicated than we thought."</p>

<p>Okay, then, there is a whole slew of problems one can do, where the
center of mass is not moving. So, I'll just give you a couple of
examples; then, I will stop, but I won't do the numbers. Here is one
example. That is a carriage that contains a horse, and the horse is on
this far end. And as they tell us to do, we won't draw the horse, we'll
just say it's a point mass <i>m</i>, and the railway carriage is a big
mass, capital <i>M</i>, and let's say the left hand of the railway
carriage is here. Now, you cannot see the horse, okay? The horse is
inside; the horse decides to--;now, he said, "I'm tired of sitting on
this side of this room, I'm going to the other side." The horse goes to
the other side. First of all, you will know something's going on
without looking in, because when the horse moves to the left the
carriage has to move to the right. First, convince yourself the
carriage has to move somewhere because originally the center of mass
between these two objects -- that one and that one -- is something in
between, somewhere here. If the horse came to that side, the center of
mass is now the average of those two, which is somewhere over there;
the center of mass has moved and that's not allowed, the center of mass
cannot move. So, if the center of mass is originally on that line, it
has to remain in that line. So, what will happen in the end is that the
horse will come here, the center of the carriage will be there, but the
center of mass will come out the same way.</p>

<p>So, a typical problem, you guys will be expected to solve, will look
like this. Given all these masses and given the length of the carriage,
find out how much the carriage moves. Do you think you can do that?
Give some numbers and plug in the things. For example, this guy is at a
distance <i>L</i>/2 of this; the horse is at a distance <i>L</i>. Make
this your origin of coordinates. Take the weighted average of those
two, and get the <i>x</i> coordinate of the center of mass. You don't
have to worry about the <i>y</i> because there's nothing happening in
the <i>y</i>. So, the <i>x</i> coordinate of that and that'll be
somewhere in here. At the end of the day, let us say it has moved an
unknown distance <i>d</i>, which is what you're trying to calculate.
Then, compute the center of mass. When you do that, remember that the
center of the carriage is <i>L</i>/2 + <i>d</i> from this origin. The
horse is at the distance <i>d</i> from the origin. Equate the center as
a mass and you will get an equation that the only unknown will be
<i>d</i>, and you solve for a <i>d</i> and it'll tell you how much it
moves. Anybody have a question about how you attack this problem? Find
the center of mass before, find the center of mass after, equate them
and that linear equation will have one unknown, which is the <i>d</i>
by which the carriage has moved and you can solve for it.</p>

<p>Okay, here's another problem. Here is a shore, and here is a boat;
maybe I'll show the boat like a boat, here it is, okay that's the boat.
Now, you are here. So, the boat has a certain mass, which we can
pretend is concentrated there. You have a little mass <i>m</i>, and the
boat is at a distance, say, <i>d</i>, from the shore, and you are at a
certain distance <i>x</i> from the edge of the boat, and you want to
get out, okay. You want to go to shore, so what do you do? So, if
you're Superman or Superwoman you just take off and you land where you
want. But suppose you have limited jumping capabilities. It is very
natural that you want to come as far to the left as possible and then
jump. Suppose it is true that <i>d</i>, which is, say, three meters, is
the maximum you can possibly jump, whereas you cannot jump <i>d +
x</i>. So, you say, "Let me go to the end and I'm safe because I can
jump the distance <i>d</i>." And again, we know that's not going to
work because when you move--Look it's very simple. If you move and
nobody else moves we've got a problem, because if you found the center
of mass with one location for you, and you change your location and
nothing else changes, center of mass will change and that's not
allowed. Here, I'm assuming there are no horizontal forces. In real
life, the water will exert a horizontal force, but that's ignored in
this calculation. There are no horizontal forces. If you move,
everything else has to move.</p>

<p>So, what'll happen is that, when you move, the boat will have moved
from there maybe somewhere over to the right like this. You are
certainly at the edge of the boat, but the boat has moved a little
extra distance <i>δ</i>, and you have to find that <i>δ</i>. You find
it by the same trick. You find the center of mass of you and the boat,
preferably with this as the origin. You can use any origin you want for
center of mass, it's not going and it's not going according to anybody,
but it's convenient to pick the shore as your origin, find the weighted
sum of your location and your mass, the boat's location and boat's
mass. At the end of the day, put yourself on the left hand of the boat,
and let's say it has moved a distance <i>δ</i>, so the real distance
now is <i>d + δ</i>. That's where you are. That plus <i>L</i>/2 is
where the center of the boat is. Now, find the new center of mass and
equate them and you will find how much the boat would have moved, and
that means you have to jump a distance <i>d + δ</i>. Everybody follow
that? That's another example where the center of mass doesn't move.
Now, let's ask what happens next. So, you leap in the air, okay? Now
you're airborne. What do you think is happening when you're airborne?
Yes? Go ahead! What's happening?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The boat will move the other way.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It'll be moving, and why do you
say it'll be moving?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Because the center of mass still won't be the same
thing.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, there's one way to say
that. The center of mass cannot move, so if you move to the left, the
boat will move to the right. What's the equivalent way to say that?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The momentum can't change.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, the momentum cannot
change. Originally, the momentum was 0, nobody was moving, but suddenly
you're moving, the boat has to move the other way. Of course, it
doesn't move with the same velocity, or the same speed; it moves with
the same momentum. So, the big <i>M</i> of the boat times the small
<i>v</i> of the boat, will equal your small <i>m</i> times your big
<i>V</i>. In other words, you, unless you move with a big speed, the
boat moves with a small speed; then, these two numbers in magnitude
will be equal. So, if you're going on one of the big cruise ships, you
jump on the shore, you're not going to notice the movement of the ship,
but it technically speaking does move the other way. Okay, you're
airborne, okay. Then, a few seconds later you collapse on the shore;
you're right there. Now, what's happening to the boat? Is it going to
stop now? Your momentum is 0, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> But you've been stopped by the force of the
ground.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. Everybody agree? I will
repeat that answer, but you should all have figured this out. The boat
will not stop just because you hit the shore. The boat will keep moving
because there's no force on the boat; it's going to keep moving. The
question is, "How come I suddenly have momentum in my system when I had
no momentum before?" It's because the <i>F</i> external has now come
into play. Previously, it was just you and the boat and you couldn't
change your total momentum. But the ground is now pushing you, and it's
obviously pushing you to the right because you were flying to the left
and you were stopped. So, your combined system, you and the boat, have
a rightward force acting for the time it took to stop you; it's that
momentum that's carried by the boat. A better way to say this is, you
and the boat exchange momenta, you push the boat to the right, you move
to the left, and your momentum is killed by the shore. The boat, no
reason to change, and keeps going. So, can you calculate how fast the
boat is moving? Can anybody tell me how to calculate how fast the boat
is moving? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> But I'm on the shore now. I've
fallen on the shore. I'm asking how fast the boat is moving.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The boat is moving as fast as [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, I think he's got the
right answer. If I only told you that I jumped and landed on the shore,
that's not enough to predict how fast the boat is moving. But if I told
you my velocity when I was airborne, then of course I know my momentum
and you can find the boat momentum and that's the velocity it will
retain forever. So, you need more information than simply saying, "I
jumped to the shore." It depends with what velocity I left the boat and
landed on the ground. If I leap really hard, the boat will go really
fast the opposite way. Okay, that's the end of this family of center of
mass problems.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to another class of problems. This involves a rocket,
and it's going to derive the rocket equation. A rocket is something
everybody understands but it's a little more complicated than you
think. Everyone knows you blow up a balloon, you let it go, the balloon
goes one way, the air goes the other way, action and reaction are
equal, even lay people know that. Or, if you stand on a frozen lake and
you take a gun and you fire something, but then the bullet goes one way
and you go the opposite way, again, because of conservation of
momentum. The rocket is a little more subtle and I just want to mention
a few aspects of it. I don't want to go into the rocket problem in any
detail. It's good for you to know how these things are done.</p>

<p>Here's a rocket whose mass at this instant is <i>M</i>, whose
velocity is <i>v</i> right now. What rockets do is they emit gasses,
and the gasses have a certain exhaust velocity. That velocity is called
<i>v<sub>0</sub></i>. In magnitude, it's pointing away from the rocket,
and it has a fixed value relative to the rocket, not relative to the
ground. If you are riding with the rocket and you look at the fumes
coming out of the back, they will be leaving you at that speed
<i>v<sub>0</sub></i>. A short time later--What happens a short time
later, the rocket has a mass <i>M - δ</i> because it's lost some of its
own body mass in the form of exhaust fumes. The exhaust fumes, I'm just
showing them as a blob here, and the rocket's velocity now is not
<i>v</i>, but <i>v + Δv</i>. And what's the velocity of the fumes?
Here's where you've got to be careful. If your velocity was <i>v</i> at
that instant, the velocity of the rocket fume, with respect to the
ground is <i>v - v<sub>0</sub></i>; that's the part you've got to
understand. The rocket has a smaller mass and bigger velocity; everyone
understands that. But what's the momentum of the gas leaving the rocket
if the mass is <i>δ</i>? But what is its velocity? Its velocity with
respect to the rocket is pointing to the left of <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>,
but the rocket itself is going to the right at speed <i>v</i>. So, the
speed as seen from the ground will be <i>v - v<sub>0</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, the Law of Conservation of Momentum will say <i>Mv = (M - δ) (v
+ Δv) + δ(v - v<sub>0</sub>)</i>. This is, the momentum before and the
momentum after are equal. So, you open out this bracket you get --
sorry my letters better be uniform -- this is <i>Mv</i>, then
<i>-vδ</i>. I don't want to call it <i>δv</i>, I want to call it vδ +
MΔv - (δ) (Δv ) + δv - v<sub>0</sub>δ. I want to call it <i>vδ</i>. The
reason I want to put the <i>δ</i> on the right is you may get confused.
<i>δ</i> usually stands for the change of something, so that's not what
I mean. So, you cancel this <i>Mv</i> and you cancel this <i>Mv</i>.
You cancel this <i>vδ</i> and that <i>vδ</i>. This one you ignore
because it's the product of two infinitesimals, one is the amount of
gas in the small time <i>δt</i>, the other is infinitesimal change in
velocity; we keep things which are linear in this. Then, you get the
result <i>MΔv = v<sub>0</sub></i> times <i>δ</i>. So, I'm going to
write it as <i>Δv/v<sub>0</sub> = δ</i> over <i>M</i>. This is the
relation between the change in the velocity of the rocket; the velocity
of the exhaust gases seen by the rocket, the amount emitted in the
small time divided by the mass at that instant. But in the sense of
calculus, what is the change [<i>dM</i>] in the mass of the rocket? If
<i>M</i> is the mass of the rocket, what would you call this a change,
the mass of the rocket, in this short time? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, no, no, in terms of the
symbols here what's the change in the mass of the rocket?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> <i>δ</i></p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's <i>δ</i>, but it's really
speaking <i>-δ.</i> You could keep track of the sign, the change in the
variable is really negative, and delta here stands for a positive
number. So, if you remember that, you'll write this <i>-dM/M</i>. Now,
the rest is simple mathematics. I don't want to do this, but if you
integrate this side and you integrate that side, and you know
<i>dM/M</i> is a logarithm; you will find the result that the <i>v</i>
at any time is <i>v</i> final = <i>v</i> initial plus--or maybe I might
as well do this integral here. This integral will be <i>v</i> final -
<i>v</i> initial over <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>, will be the log of <i>M</i>
initial over <i>M</i> final. So, you will find final is <i>v</i>
initial + <i>v<sub>0</sub></i> log <i>M</i> initial over <i>M</i>
final. I'm doing it rather fast because I'm not that interested in
following this equation any further. It's not a key equation like what
I've been talking about now. So, this is just to show you how we can
apply the Law of Conservation of Momentum. I'm not going to hold you
responsible in any great detail for the derivation, but that is a
formula that tells you the velocity of the rocket at any instant, if
you knew the mass at that instant. The rocket will pick up speed and
its mass will keep going down, and the log of the mass before to the
mass after times <i>v<sub>0</sub></i> is the change in the velocity of
the rocket. Okay, so I have to give you some more ammunition to do your
homework problems; so, I'm going to discuss the last and final topic,
which is the subject of collisions.</p>

<p>So, we're going to take the collision of two bodies, one body,
another body, <i>m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub></i>, they collide. At the end of the day,
you can have the same two bodies moving at some velocities
<i>v<sub>1</sub>'</i>, <i>v<sub>2</sub>'</i>. Our goal is to find the
final velocities; that's a goal of physics. I tell you what's happening
now. I'm asking you what's happening later. So here, there are two
conditions you need because you're trying to find two unknowns, right?
We want two unknowns, I need two equations.</p>

<p>One equation always true, so let me write that down, always true.
Always true is the condition that the momentum before is the momentum
after, <i>m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>' +
m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>'</i>. You need a second equation to solve
for the two unknowns, and that's where there are two extreme cases for
which I can give you the second equation, the one extreme case is
called "Totally inelastic."</p>

<p>In a totally inelastic collision, the two masses stick together.
That means <i>v<sub>1</sub>'</i> and <i>v<sub>2</sub>'</i> are not two
unknowns, but a single unknown <i>v'</i>. Then, it's very easy to solve
for the momentum, because they stick together and move as a unit. So,
you can write here that is equal to <i>(m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>)
v'</i>, so you get <i>v ‘= (m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>)/(m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>)</i>. That's
a simple case: two things hit, stick together, and move at a common
speed. The common speed should be such that the total momentum agrees
with what you had before. That's called "total Inelastic."</p>

<p>The other category is called "totally elastic." In a totally elastic
collision, the kinetic energy is conserved. That you can write as the
following relation involving quadratic things, <i>½
m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ½
m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = ½
m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub><sup>'2</sup> + ½
m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub><sup>'2</sup></i>. You can, it turns out,
juggle this equation and that equation and solve for
<i>v<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup></i> and <i>v<sub>2</sub><sup>'</sup></i>.
Well, I'll tell you what the answer is. I don't expect you to keep
solving it. The answer is that <i>v<sub>1</sub><sup>'</sup> =
(m<sub>1</sub> - m<sub>2</sub>)/(m<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>)v<sub>1</sub> + (2 m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>)v<sub>2</sub></i>. These are no great secrets; you'll
find them in any textbook. If you cannot follow my handwriting or
you're running out of time, just what you should be understanding now
is that there are formulae for the final velocity when the collision is
totally elastic, or totally inelastic. If they're totally inelastic,
it's what I wrote there, <i>v<sup>'</sup></i> is something. The totally
elastic you have a formula like this one. So, here you just replace
everywhere; you saw an <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> you put an
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, 2<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>m<sub>1</sub> +
m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>1</sub></i>. Don't waste too much time writing this.
I think you can go home and fill in the blanks; it's in all the books.
What you carry in your head is there's enough data to solve this,
because I will tell you the two bodies, I'll tell you their masses,
I'll tell you the initial velocities; so plug in the numbers you get
the final velocity. So, remember this, elastic, inelastic collision,
this is in one dimension.</p>

<p>Now, I'll give you a typical problem where you have to be very
careful in using the Law of Conservation of Energy. You cannot use the
Law of Conservation of Energy in an inelastic collision. In fact, I ask
you to check if two bodies--Take two bodies identical with opposite
velocities; the total momentum is 0. They slam, they sit together as a
lump. They've got no kinetic energy in the end. In the beginning, they
both had kinetic energy. So, kinetic energy is not conserved in a
totally inelastic collision, in an elastic collision it is.</p>

<p>So, here is an example that tells you how to do this carefully. So,
this is called a Ballistic Pendulum. So, if you have a pistol -- you
manufactured a pistol -- the bullet's coming out of the pistol at a
certain speed, and you want to tell the customer what the speed is. How
do you find it? Well, nowadays we can measure these things phenomenally
well with all kinds of fancy techniques, down to 10<sup>-10</sup>
seconds. In the old days, this is the trick people had. You go and hang
a chunk of wood from the ceiling. Then, you fire the bullet with some
speed <i>v<sub>0</sub></i> and you know its mass exactly. The bullet
comes, rams into this chunk. I cannot draw one more picture, so you
guys imagine now. The bullet is embedded in this, and I think you also
know intuitively the minute it's embedded, the whole thing sets in
motion. Now, you could put this on a table. Forget all the rope. If you
can find the speed of the entire combination, then by using
Conservation of Momentum, you can find out the speed of the bullet. But
that's hard to measure; people have a much cleverer idea. You should
ram into this thing. This is like a pendulum. So, the pendulum rises up
now to a certain maximum height that you can easily measure. And from
that maximum height you can calculate the speed of the bullet.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to conclude by telling you what equations you're
allowed to use in the two stages; so pay attention and then we're done.
In the first collision, when the bullet rammed into this block, you
cannot use Law of Conservation of Energy. In other words, you might be
naïve and say, "Look, I don't care about what happened in between;
finally, I've got a certain energy, <i>M + m</i> times <i>g</i> times
<i>h</i>, that's my potential energy, not kinetic." Initially, I had ½
<i>m<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. I equate these two guys and I found
v<sub>0</sub>; that would be wrong. That's wrong because you cannot use
the Law of Conservation of Energy in this process when I tell you that
it's a totally inelastic collision in the middle. Because, what'll
happen is, some energy will go into heating up the block; it might even
catch fire if the bullet's going too fast.</p>

<p>But you can use the Law of Conservation of Momentum all the time in
the first collision to deduce that <i>M + m</i> times some intermediate
velocity is the incoming momentum. You understand that? From that, you
can find the velocity <i>v</i> with which this composite thing, block
and bullet, will start moving. Once they start moving, it's like a
pendulum with the initial momentum, or energy. It can climb up to the
top and convert the potential to kinetic, or kinetic to potential.
There is no loss of energy in that process. Therefore, if you extract
this velocity and took ½ <i>(M + m)</i> times this velocity squared,
you may in fact equate that to <i>(M + m)gh</i>.</p>

<p>So, let me summarize this last result. In every collision, no matter
what, momentum is conserved; the energy may or may not be. And if I
give you a problem like this where in between there's some funny
business going on which is not energy conserving, don't use energy
conservation from start to finish. Use momentum conservation, find the
speed of the composite object. This is what you've got to understand in
your head. It's not this equation. When can I use Conservation of
Mechanical Energy? When can I not? A bullet driving into a chunk of
wood, you better know you cannot use Conservation of Kinetic Energy.
But once the combination is going up, trading kinetic for potential,
you can. All right, so let me stop now and remind you guys, no meeting
Wednesday; we meet three times next week and on Wednesday you come for
your homework exchange.</p>
