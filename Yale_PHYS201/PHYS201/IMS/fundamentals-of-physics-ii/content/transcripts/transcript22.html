<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: </b>So
I got an interesting email this weekend from two of your buddies, Jerry Wang and Emma Alexander. The title of the email is this. It says
Casaplanka, so I already know these guys are up to no good. And the question
is the following. They said, &quot;You've written a wave function &#968;(x) and <i>A(p)</i>.
There seems to be no reference of time, so where is time in this,&quot; and
they couldn't stop there. That would be a good place to stop but they went on
to say, &quot;Are you saying the &#968; is just a &#968; as time goes by?&quot; So
that's the kind of stuff that appeals to me, so I don't care if you don't learn
any quantum mechanics, but if you can do this kind of stuff I'm not worried
about you. </p>
<p>But now I have to
give a serious answer to that serious question, which I sort of mentioned
before, which is that everything I've done so far is for one instant in time.
I hope I made it very clear. So here's the analogy. If someone comes to you
and says, &quot;Tell me all about Newtonian mechanics. How does it work?
What's the scheme like?&quot; You say, &quot;At any instant someone has to
give you the x and p of that particle at that time,&quot; and that's all you
need to know. That's all you can ask and that's all you need to know.
Everything about that one particle is completely given by this x and p. That
is called a state. That's the complete description of any system is called at
state, and a state in classical mechanics for one particle in one dimension is
just a pair of numbers. It's a state because given that I can predict the
future for you. I can predict the future because if I knew the initial
momentum, namely initial velocity. I know how fast the guy is moving, and I
know where it is at the initial x. A tiny amount of time later it'll be at x +
vt, but t is very small. Then since I know the acceleration from Newton's
Laws, which is rate of change of velocity, if I knew the initial velocity or
initial momentum I can get the momentum a little later. Then in that manner I
can inch forward in time. So you need Newton's Laws, and Newton's Laws tell
you, if you like, rate of change of momentum is the force. So if you like you
can write this mdx/dt squared is the force. </p>
<p>So this part is
called dynamics and this part is called kinematics. So dynamics is how do
things change with time? Kinematics is what do you need to know about the
particle? In the quantum version of this if you say, &quot;What constitutes
complete knowledge of the particle?,&quot; the answer is this function &#968;(x).
If you knew this function you know all that there is to know about the
particle. We're not saying it's real. It can be complex. </p>
<p>Then you can ask,
&quot;If you knew the &#968; at one time what's it going to be later on?&quot;
That's the analog of this one. So I have not come to that yet. So this is a
pretty long story. It takes so long just to tell you what to do at one time.
Then I'm going to tell you how to go from now to later. </p>
<p>In Newtonian
mechanics it's just a one-word answer, x and p now is the whole story. So
anyway, since we've got four lectures including today I will, of course, tell
you before it's all over what is the analog of this. Namely I'll tell you a
formula for d&#968;/dt. How does &#968; change with time? So let's summarize what we
know. I want to do this every class so that it gets into your system. If it
is true that &#968;(x) tells me everything I need to know let's ask questions of
this &#968;. We can say, &quot;Where is the particle?&quot; So there is some &#968;.
You're told then the probability that you will find it somewhere is the
absolute value. Probability density is proportional to &#968;<sup>2</sup>. So it
doesn't tell you where the particle is. It gives you the odds, and the odds
are this. </p>
<p>Then you can say,
&quot;Okay, x is just one of the variables of interest to me. How about
momentum? If I measure momentum what answers will I get, and what are the odds
for the different answers?&quot; That question has a longer answer and it goes
as follows. Take the &#968; that's given to you, and write is as a sum with some
coefficients of functions that I call &#968;<sub>p</sub>(x), but I will tell you
what they are. They are e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> by square root of <i>L</i>. Then I said,
&quot;If you manage to write the &#968; that's given to you in this form, summing
over all the allowed values of p, then the probability that you will get one of
those allowed values is equal to the absolute square of that
coefficient.&quot; And then final question can be, &quot;How do I know what <i>A(p)</i>
is given some function &#968;?,&quot; and the answer is <i>A(p)</i> is the integral of the
complex conjugate of this &#968;(x) dx. In our case it was a ring of length <i>L</i>.
Then it's 0 to <i>L</i>, otherwise it's whatever your allowed region is. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Can you explain
________ one more time what...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
What this guy means?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So let me give an example. Suppose &#968; of <em>p</em> was cosine 4<em>&Pi;x</em> over L? Then that
looks like e<sup>4&Pi;ix/L</sup> + e<sup>-4&Pi;ix/L</sup> divided by 2. Let me put
the 2 here, put the 2 here. Then my &#968; is not quite in the standard form
because I don't have the square root of Ls. So let me put a square root of L
here, a square root of L here and also put one outside. So my &#968; looks like a
square root of L. Let me see. Oh, I know what the problem is. This &#968; is not
normalized because the rule is if you don't--first let's say it's not
normalized, so don't worry about any of these numbers. Can you see that it's
made up of two such functions with equal weight? That means if you measure the
momentum you'll only get the answer corresponding to what's here and what's
here. If you compare it to e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> you can see the p that goes here
is really 4&Pi;&#8463;/L or -4&Pi;&#8463;/L. So a particle in this state can have only two
values of momentum if you measure it, and the probability for the two you can
see by symmetry must be 50/50 for each because they come with equal weight.
But if you don't want to do that you can, if you like, like this &#968;, normalize
it, and then we square it, integrate it and put a number in front so it comes
out to have length 1. Then the coefficients here directly when squared will
give you probabilities. Yes? Oh, a lot of questions. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> So A<sub>p</sub> has
to be a real number, right?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. A<sub>p</sub> does not have to be a real number just like &#968;(x) does not
have to be a real number A<sub>p</sub>--because I'm taking the absolute value
of A<sup>2</sup>. So even if it's a complex number the absolute value of A
will always come out to be real and positive. Is that your question? See A<sub>p</sub>
is not a probability. The absolute value squared of A<sub>p</sub> is a
probability which, of course, must be positive. But A does not have to be
positive, does not have to be real. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You said A<sub>p</sub>
like the integral if you're multiplying &#968;&#42; times &#968; would that be in real
numbers?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You should be very careful.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
A particular &#968; times that same &#968;&#42; is a real positive number. This is not the
same function. I think I remember now from previous years that students will
get confused on this. This &#968;(x) is the function that was given to me of which
it was asked, &quot;If I measure momentum what answer will I get?&quot; This &#968;<sub>p</sub>
is not the function that was given to me. This is another function that
describes a particle whose momentum is p. So you've got to multiply that
function with the given function to get these coefficients. So you can change
your mind and say, &quot;Oh, I'm not interested in that &#968;. I want to know the
answer to that &#968;.&quot; Well, you take that &#968; and put it here. These guys
will not change. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I'm sort of
confused. Right next to what you were explaining you have written &#968; of <em>p</em>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no. You have every right to be confused. I did not
mean that. This is &#968; of <em>x</em>. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> And is that just &#968;
of <em>x</em> or that a &#968;<sub>p</sub> also?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> That's just the &#968; of
  <em>x</em>...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, this is &#968; of <em>x</em>.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This &#968;(x)--well, if I'm more disciplined, I can do that for you. Maybe I
should do it one more time. It doesn't hurt. So let's so let's say &#968;(x) is
cosine 4&Pi;x/L. Now first job is to rescale the &#968; so that if you square it and
integrate it you get 1. I know the answer to that is square root of 2/L. You
can check that. If you take this guy and you square it and integrate it it'll
work because the square of this will be 2/L, and the average value of cosign
squared is half. And we integrate it from 0 to L it will cancel. You'll get
1. If you do this particular function then all you have to do is write this in
terms of--first write this one, 4&Pi;ix/L divided by 2 + e<sup>-4&Pi;ix/L</sup>
divided by 2 because exponential is cosine &#952; is e  + i&#952; + e to the
-i&#952; over 2. Now I'm going to write this as 1/&#8730;2 times e<sup>4&Pi;ix/L</sup>
divided by square root of L + e<sup>-4&Pi;Ix/L</sup>. Divided by square root of
L. I'm just manipulating the function that was given to me. Why do I like
this form? Because this is of the form I wanted, A of p times &#968;(p) where &#968;(p)
I this and that's also &#968;(p). It's a normalized function associated with
momentum p. </p>
<p>By comparing this you
can see that A is equal to 1 over square root of 2 for p = 4&Pi;&#8463;/L, and A's also
equal to 1/&#8730;2 for p = -4&Pi;&#8463;/L. How do I know what p is? States of definite
momentum look like e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup>. So whatever multiplies ix/&#8463; is the
momentum that you can see it's 4&Pi;&#8463;. You see what I'm saying? If you want to
put an &#8463; down here and put it on the top and make the comparison. So these are
the only two values for momentum. So this is a state which is simultaneously
in the state of momentum 4&Pi;&#8463;/L, and -4&Pi;&#8463;/L. It has no definite momentum yet.
If you measure it then you can get this answer with probability 1 over root 2
squared, which is 1 half, or you can get this answer 1 over root 2 squared
which is 1 half and no probability for anything else. You cannot get any other
value. See, normally when you take a &#968;(x), a generic &#968;(x) that I draw, it
typically has some non-zero value in all of space, so you can find it
anywhere. But this guy has only two values of p in the sum and only those will
be possible. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> ________ you're
drawing &#8463; over there ________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This guy here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, I borrowed an &#8463;, put it on top and bottom so you can compare the
expression. I'm just saying compare, if you want without these &#8463;s, compare
this expression to that and you can see p is equal to this. Now this problem
was simple in the sense that you didn't have to do that integral, but last time
before end of class I took the following function, &#968;(x) = e<sup>&#8722;&#945;|x|</sup>.
On a ring the function looked like this, falling very rapidly and dying within
a width roughly &#916;x = 1/&#945;. Beyond that it is gone. Then if you square that and
normalize it in the circle you find this is the correct normalization. In
other words, if you took this &#968; and you square and integrate it you'll get 1.
If you're very, very careful it is not strictly 1 because this function the x
goes from &#8722;L/2 to +L/2 whereas in the integral I took it to go from minus to
plus infinity. That's because this function is falling so rapidly. The
function is falling so rapidly you don't care if you cut if off at L/2 or go to
infinity, so I did that to simplify the math, but the idea is the same. Then
if you want to know what's the probability to get some number p you've got to
take A of p a square root of &#945; times e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> square root of L times e<sup>&#8722;&#945;|x|</sup>
dx. </p>
<p>You understand that?
This is the &#968; with the root &#945; in it. That's my &#968;. That's my &#968;<sub>p</sub>&#42;(x).
If you come to me with a new function tomorrow, I don't know, maybe a function
that looks like this, a constant in some region and 0 beyond. We'll put that
function here and do these integrals. You'll get a different set of A of p's.
So for every function &#968;(x) that's a set of A<sub>p</sub>'s that you find by
doing the integral. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> So if you measure
the momentum and you get one of those answers so it becomes that answer?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. So I'm coming to that point. So the second thing is another
postulate. In the end I'll give you the list of postulates. And the postulate
says that if you measure the momentum you'll get only those values for which
the corresponding A<sub>p</sub> is not 0, and the ones for which it is not 0
the probability for getting the number is the absolute value squared of that A<sub>p</sub>.
And right after the measurement the wave function will change from this sum
over all kinds of momenta to the one term corresponding to the one answer you
got. You understand that? So in this simple example there are only two values
for <em>p</em> you can get. No other values are possible. They're all theoretically
allowed. For example, 6&Pi;&#8463;/L is a perfectly allowed momentum in that ring
because it corresponds to a periodic function, but that's not contained in this
particular wave function. This wave function is built out of only two of them,
namely 4&Pi;&#8463;/L and -4&Pi;&#8463;/L. </p>
<p>Once you measure it
suppose you got -4&#8463;/L. The whole wave function, which I had here in the simple
example, has got only two terms. This part will simply disappear, and the
function after the measurement will be this. The rough logic is that if I
measure momentum, and I got an answer, that's got to mean something in any real
sense that that is the momentum of the particle, therefore it has to be true if
I immediately remeasure it. Immediately remeasure momentum, and I want to get
exactly the same answer, that means the function after the first measurement
should contain only one momentum in its expansion, so it'll reduce to that one
term. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is there a
difference between &#968;(x) and negative &#968;(x) because it seems like everything's
just...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That is correct. I think I also explained the other day that in quantum theory
&#968;(x) and say 92<em>i</em> times &#968;(x) are treated as physically equivalent because they
contain the same relative probabilities. Of course if &#968;(x) had been properly
normalized to 1 this guy would not be normalized to 1. It's as if you live in
a world where all you care about is the direction of the vector, but not the
length of the vector. We don't live in such a world. If you say, &quot;Where
is Stop &amp; Shop,&quot; you say, &quot;Well, go in that direction,&quot; and
you're not told how far, well, you're missing some information. Imagine a
world where all you need to know is which way to go. In fact, maybe if you go
to some town and ask people where is something they'll say, &quot;Go in that
direction,&quot; that's useful information. It's as if the direction is the
only thing that matters, not the length of the vector. The analogous thing
here is if you multiply the function by any number you don't change the
information. They're all considered as the same state. And I told you from
this huge family of functions all describing the same state I will pick that
function, that member whose square integral happens to be 1. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> So after the wave
function breaks down how long do you have to wait for the wave function to
rematerialize, or does it...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, it's not break down. It's another wave function because e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup>,
which is &#968;(p), this guy is as much a wave function as any other &#968;(x) you write
down. So these are not different creatures. It's like saying the following.
I think the analogy may be helpful to you. It may not be. &#968; is like some
vector in three dimensions, and you know there are these three unit vectors, <i>i</i>,
<i>j</i> and <i>k</i>, and you can write the vector as some <i>V<sub>x</sub></i>
times <i>i</i> + <i>V<sub>y</sub> </i>times <i>j</i> + <i>V<sub>z</sub> </i>times
<i>k</i> where <i>V<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>V</i>&#8901;<i>j</i> etcetera. Think of &#968; as a vector and each
of these directions is corresponding to a possible momentum, and you want to
expand that vector in terms of these vectors. This is &#968;<sub>p</sub> for <i>p =
p<sub>1</sub></i>. This is &#968;<sub>p</sub> for <i>p = p<sub>2</sub></i> and so
on. So it's how much of the vector is in each direction that determines the
likelihood you'll get that answer, that answer or that answer. But right after
the measurement, if you've caught it in this direction, the entire vector, only
the component of the vector in the direction where you got your answer
remains. The rest of it gets chopped out. </p>
<p>It's really like
Polaroid glasses. If you've got Polaroid glasses light can come in polarized
this way or polarized that way, but once it goes through the glass it's
polarized only in the one direction corresponding to the way the polaroid
works. If it filters light with the e field going this way the light on the
other side will have only up and up. So measurement is like a filtering
process. It filters out of the sum over many terms the one term which
corresponds to the one answer you got. </p>
<p>So I don't mind
telling this to you any number of times, but that is the way that quantum
mechanics works. Similarly, if you're chosen to measure position starting with
this &#968;, and you found the guy here, once you found it--see, before you found it
the odds may vary like this. Once you found it it's there, and if you
remeasure it infinitesimally later it'd better be there. So the only function
which has the property is the big spike at wherever you found it. That's
called a collapsible of the wave function. The real difference is the
following. I gave you an example of somebody tracking me to see where I am. I
drew a probability graph, and the probability graph may look like this. And if
you caught me here, if someone says, &quot;Where will I find him next?&quot;
The answer is right there because the probability has collapsed from being
anywhere to where we just saw him. The only difference between me and the
quantum particle is if you got me here I really was here. You couldn't have
gotten me anywhere else at that right now. Can anybody find me anywhere else
except right now here? You cannot. That's because my location's being
constantly measured. Photons are bouncing off to see where I am, so my
measurement is constantly measured. A quantum particle with a function like
this, which is then found here, was not really here. It was in this state of
limbo which has no analog in which it could have been anywhere. It's the act
of measuring it that nailed it to there, but then right after that if you
measure it we expect it to be still there. Now the time over which you can do
that is <em>infinitesimal</em>. If you wait long
enough the wave function will change; I will tell you the laws for the dynamics
that will tell you how it will change, but we all believe that if a measurement
is immediately repeated for that same variable we should get the same answer.
Need not be, it could have been even worse, but at least that much is true. So
it's not going to get any more familiar. It's a strange thing, but hopefully
you will know what the rules are. When I said no one understands quantum
mechanics what I meant was, of course, by now you know the recipe. It doesn't
mean you like it, or it doesn't mean it looks like anything in daily life.
Things in daily life they have a location before you measure it, while you
measure it and right after you measure it. They're always in one place doing
one thing. Only in the quantum world they can be in many places at the same
time. But you should be very careful if this is a wave function for an
electron. The charge of the electron is not spread out. I told you that. An
electron is one little guy you'll only catch in one place. It's the wave function
that's spread out. Anyway, I think what'll happen is you will have to do a lot
of problems, and you will have to talk to a lot of people, and you have to read
a lot of stuff. You can teach quantum mechanics for a whole semester,
sometimes I taught it for a whole year. There's more and more stuff. I want
you at least to know how it works. In real life when you go forward I don't
think you need all of this. If you go into physics, or something, or
chemistry, they'll teach you quantum mechanics again, but I wanted people doing
something else; they are the people I want to send a message to. Is here's a
part of the world. If you ever hear the word quantum, where does the word
quantization come from? What's the funny business in the microscopic world? I
want you to have a felling for how that works. And I claim that the
mathematics you need is not very much. You should know how to do integrals,
and you should know what <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup></i> is. </p>
<p>So the postulates
right now are the state has given me a function &#968; of<i> x</i>. State of
momentum, definite momentum looks like this, and if you want the odds for any
particular momentum expand it in this fashion which is the same as <i>A</i> of <i>p</i>
&#968;<sub>p</sub> of <i>x</i>, but <i>A </i>of <i>p</i>, again, is that integral.
I don't want to write it over. Then if you measure <i>p</i> you'll get one of
the answers with the probability given by the square of the corresponding
number, and right after the measurement the function collapses. So it always
collapses to whatever variable you measure. Yes, another question?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It looks like the
opposite. If you collapse it and you measure <i>x</i> then what happens to <i>p</i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. His question was, &quot;If you collapse it to <i>x</i> what happens
to <i>p</i>?&quot; I'm glad you asked. I mean, that is the real problem. You
had the same question?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> No. I was going to
say well don't you not know about <em>p</em>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That is correct. So I will repeat what she said, and I'll repeat what you
said. I want to have this discussion with you guys because it's very important
because everyone's thinking the same thing. If I first take a generic &#968;, so I
want everyone to know what the answer's going to be to any of these questions.
So I take this &#968; somebody prepared for me. Let's not worry about how that
person knew this is &#968;, you're given. The electron is in this stage &#968;. If you
measure <i>x</i>, and you got <i>x</i> equal to this point the function, of
course, becomes a big spike. This spike in principle should be infinitesimally
thin, but I don't care. Let this be the width of a proton. If after that you
say, &quot;What momentum will I get,&quot; well, you know what you have to do.
You've got to write spike function equal to sum over these functions, right?
You've got to take the integral of the spike with this exponential and do that
integral, and you'll get a bunch of numbers <i>A</i> of <i>p</i> for all values
of <i>p</i>. And then if you measure momentum, and you got the one
corresponding to <i>p</i> = 6&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i>, the state which contains many, many
things will reduce to the one term corresponding to <i>p</i> = 6&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i>.
If you plot that function it will be some oscillatory function. The real part
and imaginary part will both oscillate with some wavelength given by <i>p</i>.
Be very careful. This is not the absolute value of &#968;. It's the real or
imaginary part. They're both sines and cosines. Absolute value will be flat.
So it'll go from a particle of known location to a particle whose probability's
completely flat on the circle. You understand? The wave function can look
like 6&Pi;<i>i/L </i>square root of <i>L</i> right after the measurement. Let's
call is &#968;<sub>6</sub>. The absolute value of &#968; is a constant, but the real and
imaginary parts of &#968; oscillate with some wavelength. So right after the
measurement of momentum you don't know where the guy is, and you say, &quot;Let
me find this fellow.&quot; You catch it somewhere then it's a spike at that
point, but then you have no guarantee on the momentum. So you can never
produce for me something of perfectly well defined position and momentum
because once you squeeze it in <i>x</i> it gets broad it in <i>p</i>. Once you
squeeze it in <i>p</i> it gets broad in <i>x</i>. This is really mathematical
property of Fourier analysis, that functions which are very narrow in <i>x</i>
when you do the Fourier expansion have many, many wavelengths in them. And
likewise, a function with a very well defined wavelength, because it's a
complex exponential, has a magnitude which is flat. </p>
<p>So now I'm going to
ask the following question. So when I did &#968;<i>(x)</i> the probability for <i>x</i>
was very easy, squared the &#968;. When I said, &quot;Okay, I want to look at
momentum,&quot; the answer was long and complicated, namely, take these
exponential functions, write the &#968; in terms of those, find the coefficient,
etcetera. </p>
<p>Now I can say I want
some other variable I'm interested in. I want to know what happens if I
measure energy. Energy is a very, very important variable. It's very, very
important because it turns out that if a particle starts out in a state of
definite energy, I will show that to you later, it remains in that state.
That's the only state that will remain the way it is. If you start in a state
of definite momentum two seconds later it can have a different momentum or it
can be a mixture of different momenta. But if it starts in the state of
definite energy it will remain that way. That's not obvious. I'm going to
prove that to you later. That's why it's very important. </p>
<p>So most atoms are in
a state of definite energy and they can stay that way forever, but once in a
while when they're tickled by something they will either absorb light or they
will emit light. So we draw a picture like this. We will see that the allowed
energies of the systems are some special values. Not every value's allowed.
And this can be called <i>n</i>=1, <i>n</i>=2, <i>n</i>=3, etcetera. And an
atom, for example, can sometimes jump from doing that to doing that, and in
that process it will emit an energy which is <i>E(n</i>=3<i>) </i>&#8722; <i>E(n</i>=1<i>)</i>.
That difference of energy will come in the form of a photon and the energy of
the photon is <i>&#8463;</i>&#969;, or if you like, 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;f</i> where <i>f </i>is what you
and I call frequency. And from the frequency you can find the wavelength. The
wavelength is just the velocity of light divided by frequency. So an atom will
have only certain allowed energies and when it jumps form one allowed energy to
another allowed energy it will emit a photon whose frequency--in fact, you
should probably call this frequency <i>f<sub>31</sub> </i>meaning what I get
when I jump from the level 3 to level 1. Similarly, if you shine light on this
atom it won't take any frequency. It'll only take those frequencies that
connect it from one allowed energy to another allowed energy. </p>
<p>That's the
fingerprint of the atom. Both emission and absorption betray the atom. That's
how we know what atoms there are in this star, or that star, or what the
composition is. No one's gone to any of these stars, but we know because of
the light they emit, and it's all controlled by energy. So the question I'm
going to ask is here's the function &#968;<i>(x)</i>. Someone gave it to me in some
context, and I say if I measure the energy of this particle what are the
answers, and what are the odds? So how do you think that will play out? You
have to make a guess. Suppose you're inventing quantum mechanics and someone
says, &quot;What do you think is going to be the deal with energy?&quot; You
know what the scenario might look like? You can take a guess. I mean, as I
told you many times I don't expect you to invent quantum mechanics on the fly,
but you should be able to guess. What form do you think the answer will take?
You want to guess?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> ________ they'll be
________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, but if I want to know what energies I can get and with what odds in
analogy with momentum what do you think will happen? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Would you use the
formula <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
He said use <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>. That's a good answer. His answer was we
know that the energy is equal to 1 half m v squared which I can write as <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>,
right? So you're saying if I measure the momentum and I got a certain answer,
well, the energy's that <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>. That's actually correct
except the energy of a particle is not always just the kinetic energy. For a
free particle this is the kinetic energy. For a particle moving in a potential
you know that you have to add <i>V(x)</i>. That is the total energy. Now
that's when we have a problem. In classical mechanics once I measure the <i>x</i>
and <i>p</i> of the particle I don't have to make another measurement of
energy. Do you understand that? I just plug the values I got into this
formula. For example, particle connected to a spring <i>V</i> is &frac12;<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>
where <i>k</i> is the force constant of the spring, and the kinetic energy's
always p<sup>2</sup>/2m. Say if I measured <i>p</i> and I got some number, and
measured <i>x</i> I got some number, I can put that in the formula and get the
energy. You don't have to do another energy measurement. And you don't have
to do an angular momentum measurement either. In higher dimensions angular
momentum is <i>r</i> x <i>p</i>, and if you already measured the position and
you measured the momentum just take the cross product. So in classical
mechanics you only need to measure <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>. In quantum mechanics
he made a pretty good guess that if you measured <i>p</i>, the <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m
</i>is the energy. That is true if the particle is not in a potential. But if
the particle is in a potential can you tell me how to compute <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m
</i>+ <i>V(x)</i>? You realize you cannot really compute it because if you
knew the <i>p</i> exactly you have no idea where it is, and if you knew the x
exactly you don't know what the momentum is. Maybe you know a little bit of
both, but still, how are you going to find the energy? </p>
<p>So the answer is you
have to do a separate energy measurement. You cannot infer that from <i>x </i>and
<i>p</i>, because first of all you cannot even get a pair of <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>
at a given time. I hope I convinced you. You measure this guy you screw up
that guy. Measure that one you mess up this one. You can never get a state of
well defined <i>x</i> and <i>p</i> anyway. So the way to find energy is to do
a whole other calculation. So I will tell you what the answer is, and
hopefully you will realize it's not completely different from the recipe we had
before. I'm going to give you a rule for the functions which correspond to a
state in which the particle has a definite energy <i>E</i>. Let's not worry
about how you get it, some function. You find all those functions, or you're
given all those functions, then can you imagine what will happen next? If I
give you all those functions what do you think the rule is going to be? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You separate it into
a sum of all the energies with coefficients.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. Let me repeat what she said. I hope at least some of you were
thinking about the same answer. Her answer is take the function &#968;, write it in
terms of these functions &#968; <i>E</i> of <i>x </i>with some coefficient <i>A<sub>E</sub></i>
summing this over the allowed values of <i>E</i>, whatever they may be. And
now that you said that what do you think <i>A<sub>E</sub></i> is going to be in
a given case? Would you like to continue?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's going to be the
integral or the wave function ________________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's right. That is correct. The recipe's almost complete except you don't
know what these functions are, but if you knew these functions you have to write
the given function, given wave function, as a sum of these functions with some
suitable coefficients. Coefficients are found by the same rule, and then the
probability that you'll find an energy <i>E</i> is, again, <i>A<sub>E</sub><sup>2</sup>.</i>
And everything else will be also true. Once you measure energy you've got
energy corresponding to <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>, or <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> or <i>E<sub>3</sub></i>.
Let's say you've got <i>E<sub>3</sub></i>, the third possible value. The whole
wave function will collapse from being a sum over many things to just this one
guy, <i>E<sub>3</sub></i>. The collapse is the same. The probability rule is
the same. The only thing you don't know is who are these functions &#968; of <i>E</i>?
You understand? </p>
<p>So, again, the
analogy's the following. There is a vector that we call &#968;. Sometimes you want
to write it in terms of <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i>. They are like the A(p).
Sometimes you may pick three other mutually perpendicular vectors, <i>i&#39;</i>, <i>j&#39;</i>
and <i>k&#39;</i>. And if you know those coefficients you'll get the probability
for some other variable. </p>
<p>So you're expanding
the same function over and over in many possible ways depending on what
variable is of interest to you. If it's momentum you expand it in terms of
exponential ipx of &#8463;. If it's energy you expand it in terms of these
functions. So the question is what is the recipe going to be for these
functions &#968;<sub>E</sub> of <em>x</em>. By what means do I find them? </p>
<p>Now you're getting
more and more and more recipes every day, but it's going to stop pretty soon.
This is about the last of the recipes. Even this recipe I'll tell you how to
get from a master recipe, so it's not that many recipes, but I have to reveal
that to you one at a time. Now you can say, &quot;Okay, what function do you
want me to use for every energy, what is this function? After all, when it was
momentum you came right out and gave this answer. Why don't you do the same
thing here,&quot; and that's a problem here. The problem is the energy of a
particle depends on what potential it is in because it's got a kinetic and a
potential part, so I cannot give you a universal answer for &#968;<sub>E</sub><i>(x)</i>.
I will have to first ask you; &quot;Tell me the potential the particle is
in.&quot; Once I know the potential I will give you the recipe. Imagine the
potential has been given to me, for example, &frac12;<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>, or it
could be a particle in what's called a well. You make a hole in the ground or
you build a little barrier. That's a possible potential. You can have a
potential that looks like harmonic isolator. That's a possible potential. You
can have an electron and a hydrogen atom -1/<i>r</i>. That's a possible
potential. There are many-potentials, and the answer's going to vary on the
problem. There's no universal answer for the energy functions. You tell me
what the electron's doing, what field it is in, what field of force it is in.
Then for each field of force, or for each potential, there's a different
answer. </p>
<p>And here is the
master formula. This is the great <em>Schrödinger</em> equation. So the
answer looks like this. The function &#968;<sub>E</sub> obeys the following
equation, -<i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>/</i>2<i>m</i> times the second derivative of &#968; + <i>V(x)</i>
times &#968;<i>(x)</i> is equal to <i>E</i> times &#968;<i>(x)</i>. Do not worry. I
will see you through this equation. Everything you need to know I will tell
you, but you should not be afraid of what the equation says. It says those
functions that are allowed corresponding to definite energy will have the
property that if you took the second derivative, multiplied it by this number,
add it to that <i>V(x)</i> times &#968;<sub>E</sub> you'll get some function. That
function should be some number times the very same function. If you can find
me those functions then you will find out when I will show you mathematically
that there are many solutions to the equation, but they don't occur for every
energy. Only some energies are allowed, and the energies are usually labeled
by some integer <i>n</i>, and for every<i> n</i>, 1, 2, 3, 4, you'll get a
bunch of energies, &#968;<sub>E1</sub>, &#968;<sub>E2</sub>, &#968;<sub>E3</sub>, 3,
and you write those functions down. Then you can do everything thing I said.
But the only thing is here you have to do some hard work. Whereas for momentum
I gave you that and for a state of definite positions <i>x = x<sub>0</sub> </i>I
told you spike at <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>. You didn't have to do much work. For
this you have to solve an equation before you an even start, but we'll see how
to do that. </p>
<p>So the first problem
I want to solve is the problem where there is no potential. That is called a
free particle. A free particle is one for which <i>V</i> is 0. And let me
imagine it's living on this line, the circle of length 2&Pi;<i>R</i> = <i>L</i>. </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I
should mention something else. In terms of all the postulates you notice I
never mentioned the uncertainty principle today, <i>&#916;x&#916;p</i> should be bigger
than <i>&#8463;</i>. I didn't mention it as a postulate because once you tell me &#968;
is given by wave function and that states are definite momentum have definite
wavelength it follows from mathematics that you cannot have a function of well
defined periodicity and wavelength also localized in space. It's a
mathematical consequence. Similarly, who told me that I can expand every given
&#968; as a sum over these functions? There's a very general mathematical theorem
that tells you in what situations you can actually expand any given function in
terms of a set of functions, namely are they like unit vector <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>
and <i>k</i>? Suppose I had only <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> and I don't have <i>k</i>.
I cannot expand ever vector in 3D using <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. So you've got
to make sure you've got enough basis functions and the theory tells you that if
you find all the solutions to that equation together they can expand any
function. Similarly the rule for expansion is also not arbitrary. It all
comes from that. It's a very, very beautiful theory of the mathematics behind
quantum mechanics. If you learn linear algebra one day, or if you've already
learned it, it's all linear algebra. </p>
<p>So every great
discovery in physics is accompanied by some mathematical stuff you need. Like
all of Newtonian mechanics requires calculus. Without calculus you cannot do
Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's theory for electromagnetism requires vector
calculus. Einstein's non-relativistic theory doesn't require anything; it's
algebra, but the general theory requires what's called tensor calculus, and
quantum mechanics requires linear algebra. And string theory we don't know
what it requires. People are still discovering new mathematics. But it's very
true that very often new mathematics is needed to express the new laws of
physics. And if you don't know the laws you may find out you're not
able to write it down. If you didn't know what a gradient was, or if you did
not know what a curl is, and so on, then you cannot write down the laws of
electricity and magnetism. </p>
<p>So we have to solve
this equation, and I'm going to solve it for the easiest problem in the world,
a particle moving on a ring of length <i>L</i> with no potential energy. So
what does that equation look like? It says -<i>&#8463;;/2m d<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;/<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>
+ no potential = <i>E</i> times &#968;<sub>E</sub><i>(x)</i>. </p>
<p>So let me rearrange
the equation so it looks like this, <i>d<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;/<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>&#968; = 0 where <i>k<sup>2</sup></i> is defined to be 2<i>mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup>
</i>= <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. All I've done is just taken everything to one side
and multiplied everything by 2<i>m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> </i>and called that
combination as <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. So who is this number <i>k</i>? Let's
see. The energy is <i>&#8463;k<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>, but we also know energy's <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>.
So this number <i>k</i> will turn out to be just momentum divided by <i>&#8463;</i>.
Well, momentum has not entered the picture, but we will see. Let's solve this
equation now. I say the solution to this equation is &#968;<i>(x)</i> = to any
number <i>A</i> times <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i> + any number <i>B</i> times <i>e<sup>-ikx</sup></i>.
Let's see if that is true. Take two derivatives of &#968;. What do you get? </p>
<p>You understand every
time I take a derivative you pull down an <i>ik</i>? If you pull it twice
you'll pull an <i>ik</i> squared which is -<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;, and the same
thing will happen to this term that it'll pull down a minus <i>ik</i>, but if
you do it twice you'll again get &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. So both of them will
have the property that the second derivative of &#968; will be equal to -<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;,
and that is the equation you want to solve. And <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is
whatever you like. <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are not fixed by the equation because
for any choice of <i>A</i> and any choice of <i>B</i> this'll work. So let me
write it as follows. <i>Ae</i> to the <i>i</i>. Let me write <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>
was a shorthand for square root of 2<i>mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> x</i> + <i>B</i> to the
-<i>i</i> square root of 2<i>mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> x</i>. I'm trying to show you
that these are really functions of definite energy &#968;<sub>E</sub> and here is
how the energy appears. So what does it look like to you? Have you seen these
functions before? Yes? What does it look like?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> One of the spring
wave theories?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> One of the spring
wave theories?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The equation is like the spring equation. That is absolutely correct, but what
does this function look like? That function look like something to you? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Isn't that a cosine
function?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It's a cosine only if A is equal to B. Forget the sines and cosines. They are
your old flames. What's their new quantum flame? What's the function that
means a lot more in quantum mechanics than sines and cosines? No? I think I
told you long back that <i>e</i> to the <i>i</i> times dog <i>x</i> over<i> &#8463; </i>is
a state where the momentum is equal to dog. In other words, you can put
anything you want in the exponent. If a function looks like that, that fellow
there is the momentum. So this is a state of momentum, of definite momentum.
In fact, look at this, <i>e</i> to the <i>i </i>square root of 2<i>mE/&#8463; x </i>+
<i>B</i> times <i>e</i> to the minus that. Do you understand? This must be
the momentum. It is the momentum because <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup> </i>is a state
of momentum <i>p</i>, but the momentum here can either have one value, square
root of 2<i>mE</i>, or it can have another value minus square root of 2<i>mE</i>.
So what do you think the particle is doing in these solutions? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's jumping back
and forth _______________ one of those states.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
But in any one of them what is it doing here? What is the sign of the momentum
here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, positive.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Positive, and here it's got negative momentum. And how much momentum does it
have? The momentum it has, if you look at any of these things, is that <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>
= <i>E</i> is what is satisfied by the <i>p</i> that you have here. In other
words, what I'm telling you is in quantum theory, in classical theory if I
said, &quot;I've got a particle of energy <i>E</i>, what is its
momentum?&quot; You would say, &quot;Well, <i>E</i> is <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>,
therefore <i>p</i> is equal to plus or minus square root of 2<i>mE</i>,&quot;
because in one dimension when I give you the energy, the Kinetic energy if you
like, the particle has to have a definite speed, but it can be to the left or
it can be to the right. And the momentum is not arbitrary. If the energy is <i>E</i>
the momentum has to satisfy the condition <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i> = <i>E</i>.
That's also exactly what's happening in the quantum theory. The state of
definite energy is a sum over two possible things, one where the momentum is
the positive value for root of 2<i>mE</i>; other is a negative value, and these
are the two allowed values even in classical mechanics for a particle of
definite energy. </p>
<p>But what's novel in
quantum mechanics, whereas in classical mechanics if it's got energy <i>E</i>
it can only be going clockwise or anti-clockwise, but this fellow can be doing
both because it's not in a state of clockwise or anti-clockwise. In fact, the
probability for clockwise is proportional to <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>. Probability
for anti-clockwise is proportional to <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>. I've not
normalized it, but the relative odds are simply proportional to <i>A<sup>2</sup>
</i>and <i>B<sup>2</sup>.</i> So that's what is bizarre about quantum
mechanics that the particle has indefinite sign of momentum. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Do we have problem
with <i>m</i> because <i>m</i> is too small to ________ properly?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Which one?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> With the mass is
there going to be some kind of issue if that's small?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
What about the <i>m</i>? I'm sorry.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>m</i> stands for
the mass, right?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yeah, <i>m</i> is the mass of the particle, that's right.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> But is it too small
in some way for our equations to work because we had that issue in previous
equations?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
When did we have the issue? <i>m</i> is whatever the mass of the particle is.
It can be small. It can be large. I didn't understand. </p>
<p><b>Student: </b>[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, no, go ahead. I want to know.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There are no restrictions on the correctness of this. If the particle weighs a
kilogram then you will find that--well, we're coming to this. So you find that
these are the allowed values of <i>p</i>. There are two values, but <i>p</i>
itself is not arbitrary, <i>p</i> itself is not continuous. Maybe that's what
you meant. There's a restriction on the allowed values of <i>p</i>, and
therefore a restriction on the allowed values of <i>E</i>. All I'm telling you
now is that if you want to solve that equation it is obviously made up of sines
and cosines as you recognize from the oscillator, or in the quantum world it's
more natural to write them in terms of exponentials, <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i> and
<i>e<sup>-ikx</sup></i> where k is not independent of <i>e</i>, <i>k</i>
satisfies this condition, and if you call <i>&#8463;k</i> as <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>
satisfies this condition. This is just a classical relation between energy and
momentum. </p>
<p>The other difference
is that not every value of momentum is allowed. Not every value of momentum is
allowed for the same reason as when I did particles of definite momentum. In
other words, if the particle is living on a circle and the state of energy <i>E</i>
it's given by<i> Ae<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i> + <i>Be<sup>&#8722;ipx/&#8463;</sup></i> where <i>p</i>
is related to <i>E</i> by <i>E</i> = <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>. We have the
requirement that when you go around a circle you've got to come back to where
you start. </p>
<p>And that condition,
if you remember, says that <i>p</i> times <i>L</i> over <i>&#8463;</i> has to be a
multiple of some integer, or that the allowed values of <i>p</i> are labeled by
some index <i>n</i>, which is 2<i>&Pi;&#8463;/L</i> times <i>n</i>. I don't want to use
<i>m</i> because <i>m</i> stands for particle mass, <i>n</i> is the integer
now. In other words, when we studied the state of definite momentum, namely
the first function, we realized even then that <i>p</i> is quantized. Because
of the single valued condition <i>p</i> is quantized. And if energy functions
are made up of such functions they also have to be singlevalued. That means
the <i>p</i> here or the -<i>p</i> here both have to satisfy the condition
given by this. Therefore, the allowed energies are also labeled by an integer <i>n</i>
and they are really <i>p</i> <i>n</i> squared over 2<i>m</i> where <i>p</i> <i>n</i>
is 2<i>&Pi;&#8463; n</i> over <i>L</i> . You see that? This is the
quantization of energy. So a particle in a ring has only these allowed values
of energy. So in a way this problem is somewhat easy because it's a free
particle. </p>
<p>Once you've
understood the particles in terms of allowed momenta it turns out the allowed
momentum states are also allowed energy states. The allowed momentum states,
you remember, they either look this or they look like this. And I can pick <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> to be arbitrary, so one choice is to pick <i>A</i> equal to 1/&#8730;<i>L</i>
and just take <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>. Other is to pick <i>B</i> equal to 1/&#8730;L
and pick <i>e<sup>&#8722;ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>, but you can also mix them up. You don't
have to mix them. If you don't mix them up you have a particle here which has
a well-defined energy and a well-defined momentum. This guy also has a
well-defined energy and a well-defined momentum. This guy only has a
well-defined energy, but not a well-defined momentum because there's a two-fold
ambiguity in momentum. You understand? Even in classical mechanics it's
true. If I give you the momentum you can find the energy. If I give you the
energy you cannot find the momentum because there are two square roots you can
take because <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i> is <i>E</i>, <i>p</i> is plus or minus
square root of 2<i>mE</i>. It's the same uncertainty even in classical
mechanics. </p>
<p>So what happens in
quantum theory is if you pick any particle of definite momentum on the ring
it'll already have definite energy which is simply that momentum squared over 2<i>m</i>.
You don't need to find a new function. What is novel is that since the energy
depends only on <i>p<sup>2</sup></i> you can take a function with one value of <i>p</i>,
and you can take a function with the opposite value of <i>p</i> and add them,
there will still be a state of definite energy because whether it's doing this
or whether it's doing that the energy will always be <i>p<sup>2</sup>/</i>2<i>m</i>
and the minus signs drop out of that. </p>
<p>So what is novel here
is what's called degeneracy. Degeneracy is the name, but there's more than one
solution for a given value of the variable you're interested in. You saw the
energy looks like this. Therefore, you'll find there's a state <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>
which is 0 squared over 2<i>m</i>. Then there are two states <i>E<sub>1</sub></i>.
One has got momentum <i>p</i> going clockwise and one has momentum going
anti-clockwise. So they look like (1/&#8730;<i>L</i>) <i>e<sup>2&Pi;ix/L</sup></i>.
That's this guy. Then you can have (1/&#8730;<i>L</i>) <i>e<sup>-2&Pi;ix/L</sup></i>
which is the other guy. So at every-energy, allowed energy except 0, there'll
be two solutions. </p>
<p>There are two quantum
states with the same energy. When you studied hydrogen atom in high school
maybe you remember there are these shells with 2, and 4, and 8, and 10 and so
on. They are called degeneracies where the energy is not enough to tell you
what it's doing. There at every-energy it can have a different angular
momentum. Here at every-energy it can have two different momenta, clockwise
and anti-clockwise. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Going back can you
explain how you got the ________ of <i>p L</i> over &#8463; ________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> To the left.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here? You mean this one?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I don't where that
came from.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It came just like in the momentum problem. If you've got a function like this
you have a right to demand that if you go a distance <i>L</i> around the circle
you come back to where you start. So if you take any x here and add to it an L
it should not make a difference. And what you're adding is <i>pL/&#8463; </i>and
that better be a multiple of 2&Pi;. It's the same single valuedness condition.
So the momentum problem pretty much does this problem for you, all the
singlevalued stuff we dealt with before. What is novel here is that demanding
energy have one value fixes the momentum to be one of two values, and that
double valuedness is the same as in classical theory that a particle of energy <i>E</i>
can have two possible momenta plus or minus square root of 2<i>mE</i>, and the
quantum theory, then, is the state of <i>E</i> is a sum of one value of <i>p</i>
and the other value of<i> p</i> with any coefficient you like. </p>
<p>So if this atom makes
a jump from, or this system makes a jump from somewhere there to somewhere
there you can find the frequency of the photons it will emit because here are
my allowed energies. <i>E<sub>n</sub></i> is this. Suppose it jumps from <i>n</i>=4
to <i>n</i>=3. The energy that's liberated that goes to the photon is <i>&#8463;&#969;</i>
will be <i>4&Pi;<sup>2</sup> &#8463;<sup>2</sup> </i>over 2<i>mL</i> squared times 4
squared - 3 squared. I'm just using this formula with <i>n</i>=4, and <i>n</i>=3,
and take the difference. It's 16 - 9 which 7. You plug all that in you can
solve for the &#969;, or if you like frequency you can write it as 2<i>&Pi;&#8463;f</i> and
you can find the frequencies. This is actually true. If you've got a charged
particle moving in a ring and you want to excite it from one state to a higher state
you will have to give it only one of these frequencies so that the frequency
you give it, <i>&#8463;&#969;</i>, must match the energy difference of the particle. You
understand? So I've drawn these levels here. If you want the electrons, say,
in a metallic ring going in the lowest possible energy state, if you want to
jump, if you want to crank it up to the next level you've got to have photons
at that energy, or that energy. Well, that happens to be the same as this, but
these are the only frequencies it'll absorb from you. And when it cools down
it'll emit back those frequencies, and that's something you can test. By the
way, do you know why there's only one state at <i>E<sub>0</sub> </i>and not
two? Yep?</p>

That's right. The solution plus or minus 2<i>m</i> square root of 2<i>mE</i>
has only one-answer when <i>E</i> is 0 because 0 momentum and -0 momentum are
the same. Otherwise, any finite positive momentum has a partner which is minus
that momentum. There's a very interesting piece of work being done
experimentally at Yale which is the claim that if you took a metallic ring in a
magnetic field it will have a current going one way or the other way,
unbalanced current, and it's not driven by a battery. It's not driven by
anything. Normally if you took an ordinary ring the lowest energy state will
be a field of zero current while you go one way or the other, but if you put it
in the magnetic field one can show it likes to go one way or the other way.
And now measurements are being done at Yale where you can actually measure the
tiny current due to one electron, or one net electron going one way or the
other. So this <i>L</i> is either a mathematical convenience if you're talking
about free space and you want to be able to normalize your wave functions, or
it really is the circumference of a real system. Now that we can probe nano
systems very well we can vary the <i>L</i> and we can find out all the energy
levels. </p>
<p>All right, so now I'm
going to do the one problem which is really a very standard pedagogical
exercise, and that's called a particle in a box. </p>
<p>I remember this
example the first time I remember seeing quantization, which is more
interesting than on a ring. A box is the following. If you dig a hole in the
ground and you are standing somewhere here you realize you're kind of trapped
unless you can scale this wall. Now, you can call that as a ground level and
think of it as a hole in the ground, or you can think of this as the ground
level and that's the height of your barrier. So imagine a particle living in a
barrier that looks like this. This is the potential energy. This is like the
height above the ground, if you like, and it has a height <i>V<sub>0</sub> t</i>
here, and is 0 here, and it goes from some &#8722;<i>L/</i>2 to +<i>L/</i>2. If the
barrier <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> goes to infinity it's called a box. So a barrier
that goes to infinity, I'll just show you the part that you can see here. Here
<i>V</i> is infinity, and here <i>V</i> is infinity and inside <i>V</i> is 0.
That's a particle in a box. So if the particle goes hits against the wall it
cannot, no matter how fast it's moving, go over the top because it's infinitely
high. And that's not realistic. Every barrier is finite, but just to teach
you the principles we always pick the simple example. </p>
<p>So now I want to
solve this problem. What are the allowed wave functions, &#968;, for a particle in
this potential? So let's go back to the same equation which says -<i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>
<i>d<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;/<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i> = <i>E</i> - <i>V</i> &#968;. What I've
done is I've taken <i>V</i> to the other side. </p>
<p>Now the potential is
a constant in the three regions. This is region I where the potential is 0.
This is region II where the potential is infinity. This is region III where
the potential is infinity. I'm going to first look at the region here, region III.
What's the solution going to look like in region III is what I'm asking. So in
this region the energy's something I don't know what the allowed values are.
Whatever the value is V is an extremely large number. Can you see that? In
this region don't let the barrier be infinity. Imagine it's one zillion, a
very high barrier. Then what's the solution? The solution will look like <i>d<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;/<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>
is = 2<i>m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>V - E</i> &#968;. Then the solution to that
is very easy, &#968; = <i>Ae<sup>&#954;x</sup></i> + <i>Be<sup>-&#954;x</sup></i> where &#954; is
equal to all of this, square root of 2<i>m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>V - E</i>.
I'm saying this is what I'm calling &#954;<sup>2</sup>. Look, I'm asking you give
me a function whose second derivative is some number times the function. Well,
that's obviously exponential and it's the real exponential because it's a
positive number times the function. Now <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are free parameters,
whatever they are it'll solve the equation, but we don't want a function that's
growing exponentially when you go to infinity because that means that particle
would rather be at infinity than in your box or near your box. So for that
mathematical, for that physical reason we junk this function. You pick it on
physical grounds as not having a part growing exponentially when you go to
infinity, but you do admit a part that's falling exponentially when you go to
infinity. </p>
<p>That's okay. But how
fast is it falling? It's going like <i>B e</i> to the minus some blah, blah,
blah times square root of <i>V - E</i>. That's all I want you to look at.
Forget all the <i>&#8463;&#39;</i>s and <i>m</i>'s. Make <i>V</i> larger, and larger,
and larger, and just tell me what you think it will do. If <i>V </i>is larger
and larger it's like this <i>e<sup>-&#945;x</sup> </i>I wrote for you where &#945;'s very
large. So this function will fall faster, and faster, and faster, and in the
limit in which <i>V</i> goes to infinity it will vanish. That basically means
the particle cannot be found outside the box. So your function &#968; is 0 here and
0 here. Because if you made the barrier height finite you will find it's
falling exponentially on either side, but the exponential becomes narrower and
narrower as the barrier becomes higher and higher, and in the limit in which
the wall is infinitely tall there is nothing outside. The wave function is
non-0 only inside. </p>
<p>So what's the
solution inside? Let me call this 0. Let me call this <i>L</i>. Inside the
box there is no potential, so this equation is <i>d<sup>2</sup></i>&#968;/<i>dx<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>(2mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup>)</i>&#968; = 0. It's like a free particle in the box, but
it cannot leave the box. This is what I called <i>k</i>, remember? So now I'm
going to purposely write the solution in terms of trigonometric functions.
You'll see in a minute why. So I'm going to write this <i>Ae<sup>ikx</sup></i>
+ <i>Be<sup>-ikx</sup></i>. You can see if I take any of these solutions it's
going to satisfy the equation, but k better be related to E in this form, <i>2mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>
is equal to <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. Sorry that's <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. Because
two derivatives of this will give me &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup>,</i> and if you put that
particular value for &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup></i> here these two will cancel. But I'm
somehow going for--I'm sorry, I'm going to not write it this way, but write it
as <i>C</i> cosine <i>kx</i> + <i>D</i> sine <i>kx</i>. Do you realize I can
always go back and forth between exponentials and trigonometric functions
because one is a linear combination of the other? If you want, write this as
cos + <i>i</i> sine and cos -<i> i</i> sine and rearrange the coefficients.
It'll look like something, something cosine. I want to call that a <i>C</i>,
and something, something sine which I want to call this <i>D</i>, <i>D</i> and <i>C</i>
may be complex. I'm not saying anything, but you can write a solution either
in terms of the sines and cosines or <i>E</i> to the plus or minus something. </p>
<p>So here's the
function &#968;. It looks like I have an answer for every energy I want, because pick
any energy you like, find the corresponding <i>k</i>, you put it here and
you're done. But that's not allowed because we have an extra condition which
is the &#968; was identically 0 here, &#968; was identically 0 here. We're going to
demand that at the two ends, it can do whatever it wants in the middle, it must
vanish at the two ends for the continuity of &#968; because if &#968; had two values
you're getting two different probabilities for the same point, so that's not
allowed. So &#968; must have--must match at the two ends. But look at this
function. It's got to vanish at the left end at x = 0 and it's got to vanish
at the right end. At <i>x</i> = 0 you can see &#968; of 0 is simply <i>C</i>
because sine vanishes. Cosine is 1 and <i>C</i> has to be 0 then because this
guy has no business being non-zero on the left end. That's good. This guy
vanishes at the left end so I allow it, but I have another condition. It
should also vanish at the right end. If it should vanish at the right end I
demand that sine <i>kL</i> should be 0 because sine <i>kL</i> vanishing is
fine. Then it'll vanish at both ends. But sine kL = 0 means <i>kL</i> is a
multiple of &Pi;. That means <i>k</i> is <i>n&Pi;/L</i>. </p>
<p>This means the
allowed values of k in the problem are very special so here is <i>n</i> = 1, &#968;
looks like sin<i>(&Pi;x/L)</i>, and equal to 2 looks like sin<i>(2&Pi;x/L)</i>, and
so on with some numbers in front which I have not chosen yet. If you plot them
they look like this. That's one guy. At a higher energy I've got that guy.
Then I've got that and so on because these are exactly like waves on a string,
a violin string clamped at two ends. In fact, this wave equation's identical
to the wave equation on a string. The only requirement is that the string is
clamped at two ends. Here the &#968; is clamped at the two ends because it's got to
vanish on either side outside the box. So the allowed wavelengths are the same
except here the wavelength is connected to the momentum that's connected to
energy and <i>E</i>, you remember, is <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup></i>/2<i>m</i>
then becomes <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>/</i>2<i>m</i> times <i>k</i> will be <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>&Pi;<sup>2</sup>/<i>L<sup>2</sup></i>.
</p>
<p>So this particle in
a box can have only these particular energies. So let me write it for you
nicely. The allowed energies are <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>&Pi;<sup>2</sup>/2<i>mL</i>
squared times an integer n squared, and the corresponding wave functions look
like this. They're waves in which you've got half an oscillation, or 2 half
oscillations and 3 half oscillations, but you've got to start and finish at 0.
So it's the quantization. This is why when Schrödinger
came up with this equation everybody embraced it right away because you
suddenly understood why energy's quantized. You're trying to fit some number
of waves into an interval and only some multiple of half wavelengths are
allowed, but wavelength translates into momentum. That translates into energy.
Suddenly you understand the quantization of energy. So it's got 1 state <em><i>n</i></em> = 1, and only
one state <em><i>n</i></em> = 2,
one state <em><i>n</i></em> = 3.
I'm going to come back to this next time, but you should think about this.</p>
