<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> What I did yesterday, or Monday,
was to describe to you the First Law of thermodynamics. So, let me
remind you what the context was. We're going to study a system, that's
our thermodynamic system, and for all our purposes you can imagine that
to be some amount of ideal gas trapped inside this piston and cylinder
combination. We put some weights or maybe some sand on top to keep the
piston where we want it. The gas has a certain pressure and a certain
volume and we represent that by a point in this diagram. That defines
the state. That's called the state of the gas.</p>

<p>On a microscopic level, the state is very complicated, right? There
are 10<sup>23</sup> atoms or molecules zipping around. We're not
interested in such detailed properties. We want to look at bulk
macroscopic properties of which pressure and volume is a complete pair.
That's all you need. I think I reminded you that you don't need a third
axis for temperature because we have this equation <i>PV = nRT</i>. So,
if you know P and V, you don't need temperature as another variable.
That's called the equation of state. You can use this all the time.
Whenever the gas has got a pressure and volume, feel free to use <i>PV
= nRT</i>.</p>

<p>Alright, so here's the gas. And then I want to change its state, and
I explained to you that unlike particles whose state can change as fast
as you like, you cannot change the state of a gas abruptly because if
you take half the weight off the top, the piston will fly off; there
will be a period when the gas is not in equilibrium. Different parts of
it will have different densities, different pressure. You cannot
represent that complicated state as a point in this plane. So, what we
want to do is to make changes which are slow enough for us to follow.
So, one way to do that is to take one grain of sand. Take one grain of
sand, then you lower the pressure a little bit, the piston will move up
a little bit. Move up means what? Bigger volume, lower pressure, the
gas will come there and then you can take off another grain and by
making the grain smaller and smaller, you can make these dots closer
and closer. It's going to take you a long time but in principle you can
make the gas move on some path. That is a thermodynamic process.</p>

<p>This process is always near equilibrium. You never deviate too much
from equilibrium, and it's called a quasi-static; that means not quite
static, but as slow as you like, and it is called reversible.
Reversible means that you can also go right back to where you came. If
you took a grain out, piston expands. You put the grain back, piston
contracts. So, you can go down this way or you can go up this way. I've
just chosen to, let's say, go down like this.</p>

<p>When that happens, we want to say the following thing about the
state of the gas before and after. At every point in the <i>PV</i>
diagram, the gas has something called the internal energy. The
characteristic of internal energy is it's called a state variable. And
this is a very important concept. A sate variable depends on where you
are in the <i>PV</i> diagram, what your state is. It does not depend on
the history; it does not depend on all the things the gas has gone
through in its life. If you tell me you are here, then we may associate
with that point an energy that doesn't look into the history of that
gas. That energy is nothing other than the kinetic energy. You'll
remember that it's 3/2 <i>kT</i> per atom, <i>N</i> atoms, that's the
internal energy. You can also write this as 3/2 <i>nRT</i>. If you
count the molecules then use Boltzmann constant, or you count the
number of moles then use the gas constant. It's the same thing. But
<i>nRT</i> is <i>PV</i>, so if you like, you can also write it this
way. That shows you very clearly the internal energy is uniquely
determined by <i>PV</i>, and <i>P</i> and <i>V</i> determine the
product <i>PV</i>. So, at each point in this diagram, the gas is a
certain energy. But energy is simply that ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> for
each molecule. You add it all up, that's the total energy. Okay, so we
can write it many different ways.</p>

<p>Now, the First Law of Thermodynamics asks the following question. If
I want to change the energy of this gas, how can I do it? There are two
ways to change the energy of the gas, and the total change in <i>U</i>,
meaning <i>U</i> at the end minus <i>U</i> at the beginning, where
these are two nearby points, is either the heat input minus the work
done by the gas--Let me write it as capital <i>PdV</i>. Sometimes you
write it as <i>∆Q - ∆W</i>. That's the First Law. So, you have to take
some time to understand what it says.</p>

<p>Notice from this formula here, the energy of an ideal gas, and only
an ideal gas because that's the only thing we are going to talk about,
is a function only of temperature. If you know the temperature of the
gas, you know the kinetic energy of the molecule, so if the number is
constant, the energy is determined. The energy depends only on the
temperature for an ideal gas. So basically, when I say how can I change
the energy of the gas, I'm asking how can I raise the temperature?</p>

<p>One obvious way is this. Put it on a hotplate which is slightly
hotter than the gas. Then the heat will flow from the hotplate to the
gas. That's called heating up the gas. There you don't see anything
happening, right? It's occurring at a molecular level. The molecules in
the hotplate are, on average, moving faster than the molecules in the
gas and during the collision; kinetic energy will be transferred from
the hotplate to the gas. That invisible flow people used to think of as
the caloric fluid, but now we know it's just molecular kinetic energy
transferred from the molecules in the plate to molecules in the gas.
That's this guy. This <i>∆W</i>, the plus sign of the <i>W</i> is the
work done by the gas, and minus of that is the work done on the gas.
And that means if you want to increase the temperature of the gas,
you're also told you can do the following. Push down on the piston. If
you push down on the piston, you are reducing the volume. <i>∆V</i> is
negative, minus <i>P∆V</i> is positive, and that'll also increase the
energy of the gas. Or, if you take a grain of sand out, and the piston
moves upwards, the gas works against the environment and it pays for it
through its internal energy because then <i>P∆V</i> will be positive
and this thing will be a negative contribution of the internal energy.
So, there are two ways to change the energy of the gas. One is a way
you can actually see by moving up and down the piston. You can see
somebody moving it. It's a macroscopic motion of something you can see.
That's called the work done on the gas. Other one is energy transferred
at a molecular or microscopic level, which is what we call heat.</p>

<p>And the First Law says the total change in the internal energy is
the sum of two numbers. First one is the heat input and the second one
is the work done. So, what I did for you last time was a practice
calculation in which I took a gas here, went along an isotherm. That
means temperature is a constant. That's the meaning of the isotherm.
And I want to go from some initial point to some final point. So, this
volume <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> and pressure <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>. This is
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>, and I want to find the
work done by the gas during this expansion. Well, <i>P</i> times
<i>∆V</i>, you can see, is really that shaded area here because it's a
rectangle of height <i>P</i> and width <i>∆V</i>. So, <i>P∆V</i> is
just the area under the graph that you follow. So, the work done, the
sum of all the infinitesimal works, is the pressure as a function of
volume times <i>dV</i> from the starting volume for the ending volume.
What is <i>P</i> as a function of <i>V</i> at a constant temperature is
<i>nRT</i> over <i>V</i>? Now, I'm using the factor at every point
<i>PV</i> is <i>nRT</i>, so <i>P</i> is <i>nRT</i> over <i>V</i>, and
this is a logarithm and we all know how to do the integral, as log of
the upper limit minus log of the lower limit. So, that's the first
successful calculation of work done.</p>

<p>You can take the gas on any path you like, you know. As long as you
knew the pressure at each volume, you integrated the function from the
left limit to the right limit; that's the work done. For isothermal
process, it's particularly easy because the pressure is inversely
proportional to volume, and you do that integral. This is the work
done. For example, if the gas expands to double the volume at
temperature 300 Kelvin, the work done is number of moles, gas constant,
300 log of 2. Multiply all those things; that's the work done by the
gas.</p>

<p>If that is the work done by the gas, we can also say the following.
The internal energy change is zero. Right? That's the trick question I
told you to watch out for. If you're going at constant temperature, you
don't change the internal energy. So, if the change in internal energy
is zero, it follows at every step, <i>∆Q = ∆W</i>. This quantity we
call <i>∆W</i>. Therefore, the work done by the gas is also equal to
the total heat input of the gas. We indicate that by drawing a little
arrow like this; it's just the way we like to show that heat flows into
the gas.</p>

<p>Do you understand physically what's happening? You take this gas,
you keep it on a reservoir at temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>
[<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is just <i>T</i>]. It's stuck at that
temperature. If you take a grain of sand, gas is expanding. Normally,
when the gas expands, it does work and if energy will go down, it'll
cool down. But you're not letting it cool down because you're pumping
in heat from below, maintaining at that temperature. So, this process
you should visualize as a piston with some weights sitting on a plate
at temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. You take off a grain of sand, it
moves up a little bit but you don't let it cool down because you send
in heat from below, maintaining it at that temperature.</p>

<p>For example, you got this computer air, right? You blow air on your
keyboard to blow off the dust. You know, when you blow the air out, the
can cools down. It cools down because the compressed air is working
against the atmosphere as it comes out and, therefore, it loses
internal energy and it cools down. That's because you're not giving it
enough time to absorb heat from the room. If you let the air out slow
enough so that in the process of expansion it tries to cool down but
the room pumps some more heat, then, of course, the can will not cool
down. But, you know, that's not the purpose of buying canned air. You
don't want to buy canned air so you can release it at room temperature.
You don't care if it cools down; you just want the gas to come out
really fast. So, if you don't allow heat to come in, an expanding gas
will cool down. Okay, that's also why the universe cools down. Process
of expansion.</p>

<p>Alright. So, here's a simple problem where you can do many things.
You can find the change in energy from start to finish. Zero. Work done
you find by integrating <i>PdV</i> and the heat input is equal to work
done because there's no change in energy. This is all the stuff I did
last time. I also did a couple of other topics. I'll just remind you
what they are.</p>

<p>I said we can define a specific heat for a gas. Now normally,
specific heat is the number of calories to raise one gram or one
kilogram by one degree. But for a gas, what matters is not the number
of grams but number of moles. You have already seen it here. The energy
of the gas is not proportional to the grams of gas you have but to the
number of atoms you have or the number of moles you have. So, we define
specific heat to be the heat needed to produce a certain temperature
change for one mole. We take a mole of gas and you heat the guy and you
see how many calories do I need to get an increase of one degree. But
that turns out to be insufficient. This derivative does not have a
unique value. Can someone tell me why it's not sufficient information?
You remember from last time? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: In other words, when I take a
solid and I say find the specific heat, take one gram of solid, pump in
some heat so the temperature goes up by one degree, keep track of the
calories. You are done. For a gas, it turns out if you took this gas in
the cylinder and you pump in some calories, it's going to try to heat
up and when it tries to heat up, it may also expand. When it's
expanding, then some of the energy that you pump in the form of heat,
some of it's turning into work to push the piston out. The part that
goes through the internal energy, the part that really heats up the
gas, is now less because you put in some heat from below, you lose some
heat to the expansion, so what goes in to change the internal energy,
which is what controlled the temperature, is less than the heat you put
in. So, if the gas expands during the heating process, there's a
certain energy lost due to work you have to take into account.</p>

<p>On the other hand, another person can do the same experiment of the
gas but put a pin here so the piston cannot move. Then, of course, it
cannot do any work and all the heat you put in goes into internal
energy. That gas will heat up more readily. For a solid, we don't worry
about it because the expansion of a solid is such a tiny fraction of
its volume when the temperature changes that the fact that a chunk of
copper, when you heat it, is also expanding against the universe,
against the atmospheric pressure, is a negligible effect. The <i>∆V</i>
is so small for a solid we ignore it. For a gas it's very
important.</p>

<p>Therefore, for a gas there are two kinds of specific heat. In fact,
you can define many definitions. The two common ones are
<i>C<sub>V</sub></i>, which is <i>∆Q</i> over <i>∆T</i> at constant
volume, and that's how you denote that in calculus [pointing to the
equation]. The other one is <i>C<sub>P</sub></i>, which is <i>∆Q</i>
over <i>∆T</i> at constant pressure. So, let me derive one more time
these two specific heats because it's worth going over this again and
again.</p>

<p>The key to all of this is the First Law. The First Law, written
after transposition, looks like this. Let's put <i>∆Q</i> on one side
and the other stuff on the right-hand side. In the first case, at
constant volume, there is no <i>P∆V</i> term because <i>∆V</i> is zero.
Therefore, <i>∆Q</i>/<i>∆T</i> = <i>∆U</i>/<i>∆T</i>, and for one mole,
you remember <i>U</i> is 3/2 <i>nRT</i> but <i>n</i> is 1, for one
mole. So, <i>dU/d</i>T is a simple derivative of this function with
respect to <i>T,</i> which is 3/2<i>R</i>.</p>

<p>What do you notice about this formula? It's the specific heat of one
mole of a gas doesn't depend on what the gas is. As long as it's a
monoatomic gas, it doesn't matter what the mono atom is. It could be
hydrogen, it could be helium; it doesn't matter. That's why we like to
think about the molar-specific heat or specific heat per mole. You get
an answer that's universal. If you took specific heat for a gram, then
one gram of hydrogen and one gram of helium won't have the same
specific heat because they don't have the same number of atoms. But if
you count in moles, the beauty of the formula is this number is true
for all ideal gases, whereas if you took the specific heat of copper or
silver or iron, it varies from material to material. Specific heat of
ideal gases is very simple. You don't need to look at a table. Here's
the answer for all ideal gases. It's very important it's a monoatomic
gas, which is a point-like atom which only moves but doesn't have any
internal structure so it can spin and rotate and vibrate. If it can do
that, there are other contributions to energy, but we're not going
there.</p>

<p>Now, let's calculate <i>C<sub>P</sub></i>. <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> is
<i>∆Q</i> over <i>∆T</i> at constant pressure. So now, you cannot
ignore this term. So, <i>∆U</i>, from what I did before, will be
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> times <i>∆T</i>, plus there is a new term.
<i>P∆V</i> is <i>∆</i> of <i>PV</i> because <i>P</i> is constant. If
<i>P</i> is a constant, the change in <i>PV</i> is the same as <i>P</i>
times change in <i>V</i>. But <i>PV = RT</i>, so if
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> <i>∆T</i> plus <i>R∆T</i>. If you divide every
side by <i>∆T</i> and take <i>∆Q</i> over <i>∆T</i>, then
<i>C<sub>P</sub></i> will be <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> plus <i>R</i> and
that's a very famous formula.</p>

<p>And you should understand why specific heat at constant pressure is
more than specific heat at constant volume. Think about that. If the
gas is stuck at a given volume, it's easier to heat it up because all
the heat goes into internal energy. If it is at constant pressure,
you're letting the piston move up and some of the heat is being paid to
move the piston, only the rest is going to change the internal energy.
That's why <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> is always bigger than
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>, and for an ideal gas, <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> is
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> plus <i>R</i> and this number, <i>γ</i>, is
defined as <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. This is
always the definition of <i>γ</i>, where there is an ideal gas or not.
For an ideal gas, we can calculate <i>C<sub>p</sub></i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>, which is 3/2 <i>R</i> plus another <i>R</i>,
divided by 3 /2 <i>R</i>, which is 5 over 3. So, γ is not always 5 over
3. You should be aware of that. But for ideal gas, <i>γ</i> is 5 over
3. So, this is a review of what I did last time, but I'm very eager
that you guys should be on top of this and it's worth doing it one more
time.</p>

<p>But now, I'm going to consider some more processes where I want to
find work done. So, maybe I'll start fresh here. Let's take the
following process. I start here. I go on an isothermal here [pointing
at graph], then I go backwards at constant pressure until I'm right
below this point, then I go straight up. You can ask, "What is the work
done in this process?" The work done in the curvy part of it is all of
this. That's in the part <i>AB</i>. In the part <i>BC</i>, work done is
the area of this rectangle but it's counted as negative, because a gas
is being compressed. Or, if you like, it's at some constant pressure
but the change in volume is negative for every step. So, even though
the work done is said to be the area, you've got to keep track of sign.
If you're compressing the gas, <i>P∆V</i> is negative. Therefore, in
the part <i>BC</i>, we must take away the shaded region and <i>CA</i>,
no work is done because volume is not changing. Area under the vertical
line is zero. So, you can see that in this full cycle, when I go from
<i>A</i> to <i>B</i> to <i>C</i> back to <i>A</i>, the work done is the
area enclosed by the loop in the <i>PV</i> plane.</p>

<p>That's a very useful result. We say the work done in a cycle,
there's a symbol we like to use. This curly thing on the integral means
taken around a closed loop. But you guys have to be little careful when
you write this, because somebody else can do the following thing to
gas, do exactly the opposite. Come down like this, go down like this,
and go down like that. Go up like that. The opposite way. In this case,
the work done is considered positive because the part of it, <i>AB</i>,
is taller than the <i>BC</i> at point <i>Y</i>, so the net work is
positive. Here, it's the same amount of work but the net work is
negative. So, you've got to be careful that you describe the sense in
which you do the loop. So, the same loop, as a geometrical figure, as
the same area, but the work done by the gas is positive in this case
and negative in this case, and you can use common sense to find out if
it's positive or negative. But here is another very interesting result.
Let's go to the full cycle and ask, "What's the change in U?" Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Right. His answer was <i>PV</i>
is the same. And more generally, even if it's not an ideal gas, it's a
gas made up of whatever you like. It's any system. If you return the
system back to the same state, the internal energy returns to that
value. That's what I meant by internal energy doesn't depend on the
history of the gas. For example, you can take the cylinder, you leave
it alone, I measure the energy, I go outside the room and come back. In
the meantime, you took it on a loop and brought it back. I will not
know, and I don't care because as far as I'm concerned, if <i>P</i> and
<i>V</i> are back to where they are; the gas is back to where it is;
energy is back to where it is. So, the change in the internal energy is
zero. That means the work done and the heat input are the same. So,
let's be very clear. If you guys do problems, I don't want you to lose
points for sign mistake. <i>W</i> is always the work done and <i>Q</i>
is always the heat into the gas.</p>

<p>So, this is a gas here which has done some work and some heat that's
been put into the gas, and the two have to be equal because the energy
doesn't change in the end. Now, that leads to a very, very subtle and
interesting point. There is a very clear notion of what is the energy
in the gas. There's a unique answer. There's no notion of what is the
heat in the gas. You look at a gas and you cannot say this is the heat
in the gas. That makes no sense. Try to understand why. Because if you
say there's some amount of heat in the gas, okay, whatever you want,
some number, I do the cycle and I come back to exactly where I am. I'll
put in some amount of heat <i>Q</i>, which is non-zero. So, if there's
anything called the heat in the gas, it has changed by an amount of
<i>Q</i>. That's why there's no notion of heat in the gas or work in
the gas. There's only energy in the gas. A state variable returns to
its original value and when you go on closed loop, the change should
add up to zero. That's not true for work, that's not true for heat, but
it's true for the difference. That defines an internal state
variable.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm going to consider a new process which is of special
importance. So, the processes I've considered so far are isothermal, at
constant pressure is called isobaric, and I don't know the name for
constant volume, but no work is done at constant volume. Now, I'm going
to consider the last process very, very important. It's called
adiabatic. Adiabatic process is in which the gas changes its volume but
it's completely thermally isolated, so <i>∆Q</i> is zero. You wrap this
guy in a blanket and you do things to it. No heat can flow into the gas
or out of the gas. That's called an adiabatic process. Isothermal is
quite different. Isothermal, you keep it on a hotplate at a given
temperature and as the volume changes, say as the volume increases,
heat comes in from below. Or, when you compress it and you don't want
it to heat up, heat is rejected below. But this is not the case here.
In an adiabatic process, if you let the gas expand you thermally
isolate it from everything. So, you should think about what'll happen
to a gas if I start here. That's what isothermal is. What do you think
will happen? So, let's draw a few isotherms. This is temperature, say
<i>T</i> = 300. This is <i>T</i> equal to what? More than 300 or less
than 300?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Less.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Less. And why do I say less? You
take any point here; it's got the same volume but lower pressure, so
<i>P</i> times <i>V</i> is less. So, this may be <i>T</i> = 200. If I
start here, now I let the gas expand adiabatically. That means I pull
out the grains of sand, the gas expands against the atmosphere, but no
heat is allowed to come in. Think about what that means. Gas is pushing
the piston. Gas is doing some work. It'll pay for it through its own
internal energy. Internal energy will go down and that means
temperature will go down. So, what you will be doing is you'll be
cascading down from one isotherm to another, plummeting down in
temperature until you come and stop somewhere at the lower temperature.
So, an adiabatic process will cross from one isotherm to the next to
the next to the next, changing temperature.</p>

<p>Another way to say this is that the drop in pressure for a given
drop in increase in volume, it would be more precipitous for adiabatic
because it's expanding but there's no energy coming into the form of
heat so pressure drops more precipitously. So, it won't be <i>PV</i>
equal to constant, and the question is, "What is it?" What is the
equation for an adiabatic process? What is <i>P</i> as the function of
<i>V</i>? That's what we want to ask now.</p>

<p>So, whenever you have any such question in thermodynamics, up to
this point the only law we know is the First Law of Thermodynamics. So,
you have to go back to that. So far, I've driven home the point that
every question asked in mechanics can be traced back to Newton's Law.
There are no new laws. But when you come to thermodynamics and you
study heat and temperature, there is new stuff and the First Law of
Thermodynamics is called a law, because there is no way you can derive
it from Newtonian laws. It's a new concept. So, let's ask what is
<i>P</i> as a function of <i>V</i>, given that <i>∆Q</i> = 0? So,
what's our strategy going to be? How would you even begin this? Do you
have some idea of what you might do? This is a tough question so even
if you give a wrong answer, that's fine. How do I calculate the
relation of <i>P</i> to <i>V</i> given that <i>∆Q</i> = 0? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Okay. Let me write down
everything he said. When I said <i>∆Q</i> = 0, your first reaction has
to go back to the First Law and write <i>∆Q</i> as <i>∆U + P∆V</i>, and
set that equal to zero. But <i>∆U</i> is <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> times
<i>∆T</i>, plus <i>P∆V</i> is zero. By the way, <i>∆U</i> is
<i>C<sub>v</sub> ∆T</i> for one mole. I'm going to consider one mole of
gas. Now, this is another thing you people should understand. The way
in which pressure falls for temperature is going to be the same,
whether I consider one mole or two moles or ten moles. The rate at
which it changes will not be dependent on how many moles I took, so if
you want you can take <i>n</i> moles and put an <i>n</i> here. You'll
find everywhere an <i>n</i> will come and cancel out. Now, <i>P</i> is
<i>nRT</i> over <i>V</i>. So, maybe I'll do it this way for you guys.
If you want, put an <i>n</i> back there, but you will find <i>n</i>
cancels part of the equation because <i>nC<sub>v</sub> ∆T</i>, plus
<i>nRT ∆V</i> over <i>V</i> equals zero; so the answer doesn't depend
on how many moles you took. So, I will take one mole for my
calculation.</p>

<p>Think about what this says. Divide everything by <i>T</i>. You get
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R∆T</i> over <i>T</i> plus <i>∆V</i> over
<i>V</i> is zero. This is telling you that as you change your volume
and you're coming down this graph of adiabatic expansion, when you go
from there to there, there's a change in temperature such that the
change in temperature by the temperature, plus the change in volume
divided by the volume, should add up to zero. That is a condition of no
heat flow. So, it relates a change in <i>T</i> to a change in <i>V</i>.
What I would have ideally liked is a change in <i>P</i> due to a change
in <i>V</i>, but what comes more naturally is a change in <i>T</i> over
a change in <i>V</i>. But let's worry about that later, because we've
got <i>PV = RT</i>. We can always swap the temperature for pressure in
the end. So, let's just take this definition. So, every change,
remember now, you understand you go from one point to the neighboring
point; there's a plunge in temperature. That's why <i>∆T</i> will be
negative and <i>∆</i> will be positive and these numbers will, of
course, cancel.</p>

<p>Now, let's add all the changes. Let's call it doing the integral. Do
the integral of that from start to finish, do the integral of that from
start to finish, and that integral of zero is just zero. So, this tells
me <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> times log of <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, plus log of <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> is zero. Now, you've got to go back and think
about your logarithms and realize--and I can write it as log of
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> raised to the power
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i>, times <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> is equal to zero. We just combine all the
logarithms and realize the log of <i>X</i> to the power <i>n</i> is
<i>n</i> log <i>X</i>. So, that is the same as this. Now, the log of
something is zero means that something is 1, because log of 1 is zero.
So, we rewrite the final expression I got up there by saying
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> raised to
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> times <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> is equal to 1. And we usually write it as follows.
We say <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> raised to the <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over
<i>R</i>, <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the power of 1 is
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> raised to the <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. I'm sorry,
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> raised to <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> times
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>. So, this is the relation between the temperature
and the volume. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: You could do that. That's
correct. You could write down three-halves if you like. At the moment,
I'm trying to keep it general. If it was a gas for which
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> was not three-halves <i>R</i>, all of this would
still be true. But he is quite right. For an ideal monoatomic gas,
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> would be just 3 over 2. So, what
it's telling you is that when the gas expands, the temperature falls. I
already told you that. It's telling exactly how it falls. It tells you
that <i>T</i> to some strange power times <i>V</i> is constant during
the process. Now, if you want to know what happens to the pressure, you
can do the following. You remember <i>PV = RT</i>. There are many ways
to write this. I'm going to write it in another way and you guys see if
you can follow this. <i>T<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the power
<i>R</i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> is equal to
<i>T<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the power <i>R</i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. You believe that? That's just a mathematical
trick. If that is true, this is true. You know how I went from here to
here? How did I go from here to here? Do you have an idea?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You take <i>R</i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> to the
power of [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Exactly. Raise both sides to the
power <i>R</i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. It's cooked up so that
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> goes away and <i>R</i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> falls on <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. There is another
way to write it, if you like. I'll tell you why I write it this way.
Because <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> is just <i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i>.
But let me combine that one <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> with this and write
the one plus <i>R</i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. Then, I can show it as
<i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the power 1 plus <i>R</i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. You may object that <i>PV</i> is not <i>T</i> but
is <i>RT</i>, but <i>R</i> will cancel so I didn't bother with that.
And this--don't draw the box around this yet. I will write it in a way
that's very, very standard and if you remember in your high school
days, you may remember is written as <i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i>
to the <i>γ</i>, is equal to <i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the
<i>γ</i>, but <i>γ</i> is just 1 plus <i>R</i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>, which you can see is equal to
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> plus <i>R</i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> and that
is <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. So, this <i>γ</i> is
really <i>C<sub>P</sub></i> over <i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. For an adiabatic
process, <i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i> is
<i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>. That's one way to
write it, but I will also expect you to know that you can also write it
in terms of temperature, as temperature times volume raised to a
strange power is equal to a constant, before and after. Any questions?
So, what we have done is found pressure as the function of volume on an
adiabatic curve.</p>

<p>So, I'm now going to do one last ingredient for the rest of the
stuff, which is the following. I'm going to calculate the work done in
an adiabatic process from here to here. This is one, this is two. This
is not an isothermal, which looks like that, it's an adiabatic process.
What's the work done in adiabatic process? So, let's calculate that.
Work done is equal to integral <i>P(v)dV</i>. But remember, <i>PV</i>
to the <i>γ</i> is a constant. Do you guys understand the relation of
writing <i>PV</i> to the <i>γ</i> equal to constant? It's the same as
saying <i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i> is
<i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>. That means you can
pick any point on the path and <i>P</i> at that point times <i>V</i> at
that point to the power of <i>γ</i> will be a fixed number. That number
is <i>C</i>. In other words, this <i>C</i> can be
<i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i> if you like, or
<i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i> if you like or
<i>P<sub>3</sub>V<sub>3</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i> if <i>3</i> is
another point on this trajectory. It's convenient to call that
invariant product of <i>PV</i> raised to <i>γ</i> as <i>C</i>. Because
then we can do the integral as <i>dV</i> over <i>V</i> to the <i>γ</i>
with a constant <i>C</i> here from <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>And this is a pretty simple integral. You guys know that the
<i>x</i> to the <i>n</i> integral is <i>x</i> to the <i>n</i> plus 1
over <i>n</i> plus 1, such that <i>V</i> to the <i>γ</i> minus 1, over
<i>γ</i> minus 1. Because this is really <i>V</i> to the minus
<i>γ</i>. Now, did I get it wrong here? I think I got it wrong. Sorry.
It's 1 minus <i>γ</i>, 1 minus <i>γ</i>, over 1 minus <i>γ</i>. Because
<i>V</i> to the minus <i>γ dV</i>, is equal to <i>V</i> to the minus
<i>γ</i> plus 1 over minus <i>γ</i> plus 1. Right? <i>x</i> to the
<i>n</i> integral is <i>X</i> to the <i>n</i> plus 1 over <i>n</i> plus
1, <i>n</i> happens to be minus <i>γ</i> here.</p>

<p>Okay, now watch this. This constant I said can be written as any of
these numbers, but let me write when it multiplies this; let me write
as <i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>. Can you see what
happens if I do that? Try to do this in your head. <i>C</i> multiplies
all of this. When <i>C</i> multiplies this guy, let me write the
constant as <i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>; that
gives me a <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>,<i>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>
combines with <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> to the one minus <i>γ</i>, to give
me just <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. Likewise, <i>C</i> multiplying this one,
when the same <i>C</i> multiplies this, let's write <i>C</i> as
<i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> to the <i>γ</i>, and we'll find
there's that. And people like to rewrite this by changing the sign
everywhere as <i>P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> minus
<i>P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>γ</i> minus 1, because
<i>γ</i> minus 1 is the positive quantity. So, this is the work done in
an adiabatic process.</p>

<p>So, what's been going on? Let's think about what I've been doing. I
told you that there is a new process called adiabatic, a really
important process, in which the system is not allowed to exchange heat
with the outside world. <i>∆Q</i> = 0 is a condition relating <i>∆U</i>
and <i>P∆V</i>. And the changes are correlated and the effect of adding
up all the changes, namely doing the integral, is this one, namely
temperature to the <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> times
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i> does not change along the path. So, if you take
any two points, that combination of temperature and volume doesn't
change. Then, since <i>PV</i> equal to essentially <i>T</i>, you can
also write it as pressure times volume to the power of <i>γ</i> doesn't
change. So, I'm saying you can call all of that equal to some constant
<i>C</i>. The <i>C</i> is not a universal constant, like velocity of
light. For a given gas, on a given experiment, it does not change as it
goes through adiabatic expansion. So, don't think of it as a universal
constant. On the trajectory, on the adiabatic curve, it's a constant.
It's like saying kinetic energy plus potential energy is a constant.
It's not a constant you can look up in a book. It depends on what your
particle is doing. But for that particle in those conditions, kinetic
with potential adds to a particular constant we call total energy.
Likewise, <i>PV</i> to the <i>γ</i> is a constant for this particular
gas.</p>

<p>Okay, so all this is actually a preparation for something else. And
that's what we are going to discuss now. So, between now and the end of
this course we are going to discuss the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
So, we have done all we want to do with the First Law. So, you guys
should be able to be given various graphs on the <i>PV</i> plane, find
the work done in going from here to there, find the change in internal
energy, find the heat added and so on. I hope you can do such problems,
but they're all going to be one of these formulas. Say there's going to
be adiabatic or constant pressure or constant temperature, so you just
plug the numbers in, keep track of the signs by using common sense.</p>

<p>Alright. So now, we come to the last part of thermodynamics, which
is to me one of the most beautiful parts of thermodynamics, which
starts out with asking the following question. There are certain things
in this world that are perfectly allowed but don't seem to happen.
Let's take many examples. Take the Joule experiment. You take a
cylinder of water with a paddle that can spin and you put some weight
around the pulley and the weight goes down. Paddle spins; the water
heats up. You take a movie of that, and the movie is so fine it can
even catch individual molecules. Now, you play the movie backwards. So,
you watch the movie being played back and what do you find? Suddenly,
the weight starts moving up, paddle spins the other way, and the water
cools down. This is not in violation of any of the laws you have
learned including the First Law of Thermodynamics, because when the
weight went down and the water heated up, some amount of work was done
on the water, and the energy of the water went up. In the reverse
process, the energy of the water went down and instead the weight went
up, so work was done by the system. But that doesn't seem to happen. If
the weight comes down you can wait all day.</p>

<p>Well, let me give you another example. Take a chunk of wood, you
slide it there. Sorry. It was not a piece of wood and it didn't stop.
See, this is why I don't do demonstrations because even the simplest
demonstration I have done doesn't work. So, that's why some of us
become theoretical physicists. I did a demonstration where some trolley
is supposed to shoot a little marble. All the marble had to do was come
down and even that didn't work, so I don't do demonstrations. Well,
let's try this. Here's an eraser, and give it a push and it stops. Take
the movie of that. Play it backwards. You will find suddenly, you know
the table heats up a little bit due to friction. The table can cool
down and the eraser can move backwards picking up speed [laughter].
Right. So, why did we laugh? You have no reason to laugh right now
because it doesn't violate anything you have learned, other than your
daily experience, because in the reverse process every atom, you know,
every atomic thing on the desk that started moving, is made to stop,
turn around, and move in the backwards direction. And every collision
between atoms on the desk and atoms on the eraser will obey all the
laws of mechanics.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a planet going around the Sun, if you stop
the planet and you reverse the velocity, it will go the opposite way
and the opposite motion is in complete accord with Newton's laws. In
fact, there may be somewhere a solar system where the planet actually
goes the other way. It doesn't violate anything. So, in all the movies
which are played backwards, at the very microscopic level there's
nothing that says it cannot happen, and yet it does not happen.</p>

<p>Here's another thing that does not happen. I take a box and I put
some gas molecules on one side and there's a partition holding them in
that side. Then I remove this partition and I wait a little bit; then I
know the gas fills up. That's like perfume leaking out of the bottle.
Now, take a movie of these molecules. When they go from here to here,
and play the movie backwards--What'll happen when you play the movie
backwards? Let's say this guy was moving like this the instant we
played the movie back. Well, in the backwards movie it started going
the other way and slowly the whole thing will untangle itself and end
up here. That also will not happen. We all know that if you go to a
room and you release some gas from one side, it can fill the room but
it's not ever going to come back, and yet it doesn't violate any laws
because if I made a movie and played it backwards, in every microscopic
interaction between molecules, there'll be no violation of any of the
laws of nature. But that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Here's another thing that doesn't happen. I take a chunk of some hot
copper and I take a chunk of some cold copper. Hot, cold. I just put
them on top of each other, come back in an hour, it's become, say,
lukewarm. That's fine. But now maybe, if I wait long enough, the
lukewarm will automatically spontaneously separate into hot and cold.
That doesn't seem to happen. The heat simply seems to flow from hot to
cold but never back from cold to hot. But flowing from cold to hot will
not violate the Law of Conservation of Energy. As long as the same
number of calories go from cold to hot, it doesn't violate anything.
And that doesn't seem to happen.</p>

<p>So, this can go on and on and on with some large number of things
that are allowed but don't happen. So, we cannot explain them with any
known laws of physics so we elevate that to a new law. The new law will
say these things cannot happen. But you don't have a law that says
these things cannot happen, right? That's not a good enough law. You've
got to say what things cannot happen. I've got a list a mile long. Hot
and cold, when mixed, will never separate back into hot and cold. A
gas, that genie that got out of the bottle, won't go back, there's gas
that came out won't go back. There's a whole lot of processes which we
call irreversible. They never seem to happen backwards. They only
happen forwards, and we cannot list all of them. So, you wonder if
there's any law--see, anytime you cannot explain something from prior
things, you elevate that to a law. But you like an economical law. You
would not like a law that says the following million things cannot
happen. And it's really amazing that there is one law, a single law,
that not only is qualitative, but is quantitative, that tells you
exactly when some things can happen and when some things cannot happen,
and according to the one single law, all the things that we say don't
happen won't happen. Will be forbidden by the law, and that's a Second
law of Thermodynamics, but what form does it take?</p>

<p>Well, we will see it introduces a certain quantity called entropy,
about which let's say right now we don't know anything, and the law
will simply say the entropy of the universe will always increase. You
don't have to write it down now. I'm going to define the concept. It'll
arise naturally from more thinking. The one law that entropy will
always increase, in the universe as a whole, is enough to forbid any of
these forbidden processes. In other words, if the paddle spun the other
way and the weight went up and the water cooled down, you can show the
entropy of the universe would have actually gone down. That's why
that's not allowed. If you drop a piece of egg, it comes and splatters
all over the floor. If it rejoined and rose back to your hand, it won't
violate any other principle other than the law of entropy, because the
shattered egg has more entropy than the egg that comes back to your
hand. And if hot and cold mix to become lukewarm, you can show the
entropy goes up this way, but if you went the other way, entropy will
go down and that's now allowed. So, one great law will take care of all
these things. So, you've got to ask yourself, "What is the one great
law and how do we get to it?"</p>

<p>Well, it turns out this great law was discovered by an engineer
called Carnot. So, here is another thing. People don't wake up and say,
"I'm going to discover a great law." People just go out and do their
business and all you need is have enough sense to realize when you've
stumbled on something really great. So, Carnot had a very practical
question. Carnot was working on engines. At the time they were working
on something like the steam engine. So, a steam engine--You know what
happens in a steam engine. You take some coal, you set fire to it, then
you boil some water, it turns into steam, then the steam pushes the
pistons and the wheels turn and the train goes forward and that's your
steam engine.</p>

<p>What happens in a steam engine we can schematically as follows.
There is a hot reservoir <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> that's the furnace of
your steam engine. Then, you have an engine in which you've got some
steam. You've got some water that's going to be boiled and it's going
to boil only because you take in some heat. Here's my engine, it's got
some substance inside, it could be a gasoline engine or a steam engine,
we don't care what happens. Some amount of heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> is
taken from a hot reservoir and some amount of work is delivered. Now,
here is an engine which, as drawn here, doesn't violate any of the laws
of physics, provided <i>Q<sub>1</sub> = W</i>, then energy is
conserved. In practice you find that's not how engines work. The engine
also rejects some amount of heat <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> to a lower
temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>The lower temperature, if you look at a steam engine--if you've
gone--Have you guys seen a steam engine? Okay, if you really go see a
steam engine you will find there's a lot of hot steam coming out of the
back or in a car, you've got exhaust gases coming out. That's the hot
gas emitted at atmospheric temperature. Inside the engine is a very hot
place. So, the car emits some heat at a lower temperature. The steam
engine emits some steam at a lower temperature. So, the work that you
can get is really <i>Q<sub>1</sub> - Q<sub>2</sub></i> is what you can
get. At least in this engine, you get <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>-Q<sub>2</sub></i>. So, we define a quantity called efficiency
<i>η</i>. It's called the efficiency. It's what you get divided by what
you pay for. You pay for burning the coal and you get the work out. The
work is, of course, the thing that makes the engine move forward. Turns
into kinetic energy of the locomotive. That, then, you can see is
<i>Q<sub>1</sub> - Q<sub>2</sub></i>. What you get divided by what you
pay for, you can write it as 1 minus <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, in every engine, some heat is taken in. Some of it is converted
to work and some of it is rejected. To the extent heat is rejected, the
efficiency is less than 1, because Q<sub>2</sub> minus--over
Q<sub>1</sub> and is subtracted from 1. So, you can ask yourself why
not build an engine in which you just don't reject any heat downstairs?
Why not take all the heat and convert it to work? So, Carnot gave a
great argument on the most efficient engine you can build. In other
words, there is an upper limit to the efficiency and it's not 1. So,
what is it and how are you going to find out? Well, he's going to find
out what it is, but he also needs a postulate. Carnot's postulate is
the old version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. He didn't talk
about entropy. You can show in the end they're all equivalent, but
Carnot's law, which is his own version of the Second Law, which says
the following.</p>

<p>So, Law 2 according to Carnot. Let me just draw a figure; then,
we'll say <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> is not allowed. Carnot says you cannot
build an engine whose sole effect at the end of the day is to transfer
some heat from a cold body to a hot body, whose sole effect--that's
very, very important. You cannot have a process whose sole effect is
this. I mean, I don't feel like writing what this is. It's what the
picture says. All right, it doesn't take a genius to have the heat flow
the other way. You understand? If you want heat to flow from a hot body
to a cold body, that's trivial. Just connect them with a metal rod and
it'll flow. The sole effect of that is transfer of heat from hot to
cold. That's the way of the natural order of things, but Carnot is
saying you can never build a set of gears and wheels and teeth and
whatever you like so that at the end of the day, all that has happened
is heat has flowed from cold to hot. That is going to be taken as a
postulate, and people are willing to take that as a reasonable
postulate, and we want to see what we can get out of that
postulate.</p>

<p>It turns out it is that postulate that's going to control the
efficiency of heat engines, put a bound on the efficiency of heat
engines. So, don't deduce this. This is a law. Now, you might say,
well, this is how the law began, and the law assumed more and more
sophisticated forms, so Carnot was not thinking entropy. That came
later, but his postulate was, please grant me this, which seems to be a
fact in nature. Then from that let me talk about heat engines and show
you that there is an upper limit to the efficiency of an engine.</p>

<p>In particular, the upper limit is not 1. It's clear to everybody
that the limit cannot be more than 1. If it's more than 1, you are
taking some amount of heat and giving even more amount of work
delivered. That violates the First Law of Thermodynamics. Conservation
of energy. But the fact that you must necessarily reject some heat,
which you cannot use in this experiment, is the content of Carnot's
result.</p>

<p>So, here is the engine that Carnot built. This is called a Carnot
engine. By the way, look, don't rely on my graphics. I mean, you have
to go look at just about any book you can find on the market. It'll
talk about Carnot engines. So, I'm here to merely tell you the words
and not the pictures. So, Carnot's engine is like this. Take two
isothermals, <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. You
remember the adiabatic curves are much steeper. Draw two adiabatic
curves like that. Then take a gas from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>
to <i>D</i> and back to <i>A</i>. That was the Carnot engine. So, let's
see what we are doing. In the process <i>AB</i>, take the piston with
the gas in it; slowly lift the grains of sand so it expands to a volume
<i>B</i> at the same temperature. Then having reached <i>B</i>, you
thermally isolate the gas. It's not on top of a reservoir of
temperature <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. It's completely isolated. Take out
even more grains of sand. Now, it's expanding without any energy coming
in. It cools down to <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. This is the point <i>C</i>.
Now, you put the grains of sand back, but it's still on a hot reservoir
at <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. I mean, the cold reservoir of
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. Put the grains of sand back, temperature is
locked in at <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> until you come here. Then, you
isolate the gas and put more grains of sand back until you come back to
<i>A</i>. Obviously, such a path exists because of the way isothermals
and adiabatics are in the <i>PV</i> plane. That's the Carnot cycle, and
the important part of the Carnot cycle is that it's reversible.</p>

<p>It's reversible because at every stage, when you took a grain of
sand out you can put it back and you can run it backwards. So, it can
also run backwards. The Carnot engine looks like this. Here is the
engine, it takes some heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> from a reservoir of
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i> that delivers some work <i>W</i>; it rejects some
heat <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, of temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>. This is
the model of a steam engine. Suppose you run the Carnot engine
backwards. By the way, the work done by the Carnot engine is this
shaded region here and it absorbs heat in the stage <i>AB</i>. It
doesn't have any heat absorption in the state <i>BC</i> because it's
adiabatic. In <i>CD</i>, it rejects some heat and <i>DA</i> again,
there's no heat transfer. So, heat comes in here, <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>,
heat is rejected here, <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>If you run the Carnot engine backwards, let me show you what it
looks like. Everything is backwards in a Carnot engine if you run it
the other way. Some work is put in here, some heat <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>
is taken from the lower reservoir and the heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> is
delivered to the upper reservoir. You know what that gadget is. That's
a refrigerator. So, in a refrigerator, that's what happens. You might
say hey, you violated the Second Law. You have transferred heat from a
cold to hot body, but it was not the only thing that happened, because
some compressor somewhere did some work. That's certainly allowed. What
is not allowed is to have it flow from cold to hot with nothing
involved.</p>

<p>The second thing to notice is the gas, after doing its thing, comes
back to the starting point. That means you can do it over and over and
over again. In one cycle, the gas has some heat coming in.
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> heat rejected <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, some work
done, <i>W</i>, and it comes back to where it is and you can go on
doing it many, many times. That's why it's a useful engine. If the
substance returns to the starting point, having done some work in
return for some heat, you can do it over and over again. And Carnot's
question was, "What's the efficiency of this engine?" We're going to
calculate that now.</p>

<p>So, the efficiency of the engine is <i>η</i>, is <i>Q<sub>1</sub> -
Q<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. Or 1 -
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. Well,
<i>Q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> are pretty easy to
calculate. Let me tell you why. In the process <i>AB</i>, remember
isothermal expansion? The heat input is the work done, because change
in internal energy is zero. And the work done, you remember, is
<i>nRT</i> <i>log V<sub>B</sub></i> over <i>V<sub>A</sub></i>.
Similarly, <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, as a positive number, is
<i>nRT<sub>2</sub></i> <i>log V<sub>c</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>D</sub></i>. Remember, <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> here is defined as
a positive number, even though it's the heat rejected, so if I want to
get a positive number, I write the log of the initial over <i>V</i>
final, so I get a--sorry, <i>V<sub>c</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>D</sub></i>. So, the efficiency now becomes 1 -
<i>Q<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>, becomes 1 minus
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub> log V<sub>c</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>B</sub></i> divided by log--I'm sorry, <i>V<sub>c</sub></i>
over <i>V<sub>D</sub></i> divided by a <i>log V<sub>B</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>A</sub></i>. Again, if you cannot follow my script here, you
may have to go back and get the subscript right. But don't worry too
much about all the details. What I want you to know is the heat input
here and the heat rejected here are all a familiar quantities from what
I did earlier.</p>

<p>But now, here is the punch line; <i>η</i>, I claim is 1 -
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. In other words, I'm
saying forget this ratio of logarithms. It is just 1. I will show that
to you, of course. It's not going to be written without proof, but the
final answer for efficiency of this engine is 1 - <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>
over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>. So, we need to show why
<i>V<sub>c</sub>/V<sub>D</sub></i> is the same as
<i>V<sub>B</sub>/V<sub>A</sub></i>. Well, I will derive that here, then
for a couple of minutes I'll talk about it, then we'll come back and
resume the discussion. I'm going to show you that
<i>V<sub>c</sub>/V<sub>D</sub></i> is the same as
<i>V<sub>B</sub>/V<sub>A</sub></i>. I'm going to show that to you. Then
you agree, if I take the logs then, the logs will cancel. How do I know
this? Well, go back and use the fact that that's an isothermal process.
That is an isothermal process. That is an adiabatic process and that's
an adiabatic process [drawing graph on board]. This is temperature
<i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, this is temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, this is
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>Now, somewhere in your notes is a formula that in an adiabatic
process, volume <i>A</i> times temperature 1 to some strange power, I
don't care what the power is--it's not going to matter. It's the same.
Sorry, volume <i>B</i> times temperature to some power is the same as
volume <i>C</i>, the same, temperature <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> to some
power. Because in the process of adiabatic, we have seen <i>PV</i> to
the <i>γ</i> is constant, but I told you can also write it as volume
times temperature to some power is a constant. So, <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> are correlated this way.</p>

<p>Likewise, <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> are connected by an adiabatic
process so you can be sure that <i>V<sub>A</sub></i>,
<i>T<sub>A</sub>,</i> that happens to be <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> , raised
to some power, is the same as <i>V<sub>D</sub>T<sub>2</sub></i> raised
to same power. We don't care what the power is. It's probably
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i> or <i>R</i> over
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i>. I'm not interested in that. In fact, if you go
back to this top right-hand corner you can see it is volume times
<i>T</i> to the power of <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> over <i>R</i>. But it's
not important. The fact that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> lie on an adiabatic
curve means that the volume at <i>B</i> and the temperature at
<i>B</i>, which happens to be <i>T<sub>1</sub>,</i> and the volume of
<i>C</i> and the temperature of <i>C</i>, which happens to be
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, are connected by this result. Once I write it
down for this adiabatic and this adiabatic, now divide that by that,
and that by that, and the point is that <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, to
whatever power it is, cancels top and bottom, top and bottom, and I get
the result I wanted, which is <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>A</sub></i>, is <i>V<sub>c</sub></i> over
<i>V<sub>D</sub></i>. Once you put that in, you get the final result
<i>η</i> is 1 - <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, there are some things you should know all the time and
something you should know some of the time, and something you should've
seen at least once. The derivation of the result you should've seen at
least once in your life. Whether you carry it in your head or not, I'm
not interested in. But what have I really done?</p>

<p>I've taken an ideal gas and taken it over a cycle and I found out
that in that cycle, the ideal gas does function like a very primitive
heat engine because it takes some heat <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>, rejects
some heat <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, and does some work given by the shaded
area. And the ratio of work done to heat absorbed in the end happens to
be 1 - <i>T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub></i>. It does not depend on the
gas. It depends only on the upper temperature and the lower
temperature. Now, the question you can ask is, "Why are you computing
the efficiency of this really primitive and stupid engine when we're
interested in real engines that GM is going to make or some steamship
is going to make or some engineer is going to make?" We will show next
time that this efficiency is a theoretical maximum. I will show you
next time that no engine can beat the Carnot engine. No engine can be
as good. It can be as good but cannot be better than the Carnot engine,
and that's what makes the result important. It's a lot like a
relativity example, but to show you why time slows down in a moving
frame I took a very stupid clock where the clock ticks because light
beam goes up and down. That's not your idea of a clock, but in that
clock, if you can see why it slows down, you know that every clock has
to slow down because all clocks in a moving rocket must run at the same
rate. Otherwise, you can compare the two clocks and find out you are
moving. Likewise, if you take a very primitive engine, but you can show
that that engine is the most efficient engine, you are done because
that's going to put an upper limit on the efficiency. So, I'll come
back and I'll tell you next time why no engine can beat this engine and
why hidden in this result is the notion of entropy.</p>
