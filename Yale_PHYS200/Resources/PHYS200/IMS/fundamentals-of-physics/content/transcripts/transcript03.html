<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Let me start again by reminding
you what it is that was done last time. If you say, "Can you summarize
for me in a few words the main ideas?" I would like to do that. What I
did last time was to show you how to handle motion in more than one
dimension. I picked for it two dimensions as the standard way to
explain it. By the way, I would like to make one recommendation. If you
guys are coming in a little late, don't worry about submitting the
homework. Just come in and settle down, because it's very hard to
lecture with this amount of traffic. I do try to start a few minutes
late, but I also have to finish a few minutes early so you can go to
your next class. Also, people who come in early maybe should try to sit
in the middle part of the classroom, so the latecomers can come in
without too much disruption.</p>

<p>So, summary of last time. If you live in two dimensions or more,
you've got to use vectors to describe most things. The typical vector
is called <i>V</i> or <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> something with an arrow on
it. The most important vector is the position vector that tells you
where the object is. It's got components which are <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> that could vary with time. <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> are unit
vectors in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions. You can deal with a
vector in one of two ways. You can either think of it as an arrow and
imagine the arrow, or you can reduce it to a pair of numbers, <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i>. If you want to add two vectors, you can add the arrows by
the rule I gave you or just add the components of the two guys to get
the component of the sum and likewise for the <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>I mentioned something of increasing importance only later, which is
that you are free to pick another set of axes, not in the traditional
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> direction, but as an oblique direction. If you
do, the unit vectors are called <i>I</i> prime and <i>J</i> prime, the
components of the vector change. You can imagine that if a vector is
viewed from an angle, then its components will vary with the
perspective. So the components of the vector are not invariant
characterizations of the vector. That is, the vector itself has a life
of its own. The components come in the minute you pick your axis. It's
not enough to say these are the components of the vector; you've got to
tell me, "I am working with <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>, which I define in
the following manner."</p>

<p>I gave you a law of transformation of the components; namely, if the
vector has components <i>ax</i> and <i>ay</i> in one reference frame
and <i>ax</i> prime and <i>ay</i> prime in another reference frame, how
are the two related? They come from writing <i>I</i> prime and <i>J</i>
prime in terms of <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>, then sticking it in an
expression and identifying the new representation. Somehow, when I told
you to invert the transformation, some of you had some difficulty.
Maybe you didn't realize that they are just simultaneous equations that
you solve. Normally, if I tell you 3<i>x</i> + 4<i>y</i> = 6, and
9<i>x</i> + 6<i>y</i> = 14, you know how to solve it. It's like really
the same kind of problem, except that the 3 and 4 will all be placed by
sin <i>φ</i> and cos <i>φ</i> but they are just the numbers. You
eliminate them the same way you eliminate them. I've given you a
homework problem where you can try your skills. When you go today and
look at the homework, you'll find the problem from the textbook, one
extra problem that deals with all of this.</p>

<p>Then, I gave you one other very important example of a particle
moving in the <i>xy</i> plane. <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> can be whatever
you like, but I picked a very special example where <i>x</i> looked
like this: <i>r</i> times cos <i>ωt</i>. This times <i>I</i> + <i>r</i>
times sin <i>ωt</i>. You should go back and remember what we did. If it
took you a while to digest it, I ask you to think harder. This
describes a particle that's going around in a circle. We know it's
going around in a circle because if I find the length of this vector,
which is the <i>x</i>-square part, plus the <i>y</i>-square part, I
just get <i>r<sup>2</sup></i> at all times, because sine square plus
cosine square is one. So we know it's moving on a circle of radius
<i>r</i>. Furthermore, as time increases, the angle, <i>ωt</i>, is
increasing in this fashion. Omega is called the angle of velocity. I
related it to the time period, which is the time it takes to go around
a full circle, by saying once you've done a full circle, <i>ωt</i>
better be 2<i>π</i>.</p>

<p>So this new quantity <i>ω</i>, which may be new to you, is related
to the time period. How long does it take to go one round in this
fashion? You're also free to write it in terms of the frequency. The
time period and frequency are reciprocals. If it takes you 1/60 of a
second to go around once, then you do it 60 times a second. Omega is
really very simple quantity. It's related to the frequency with which
you go around the circle but is multiplied by 2<i>π</i>. Why is that?
Frequencies, how many times you go around, and 2<i>π</i> is the rate at
which the angle is being changed. But if every revolution is worth
2<i>π</i> radians, then 2<i>πf</i> is the number of radians per second.
<i>f</i> is revolutions per second and 2<i>πf</i> is radians per
second. It's called the angle of velocity.</p>

<p>The most important result from last time was that if you took this
<i>r</i>, and you took two derivatives of this to find the
acceleration, <i>d</i>2<i>r</i> over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>, try to do
this in your head. If you took the two derivatives of this guy, first
time it will become -<i>ω</i>, sin <i>ωt</i>; second time it will
become -<i>ω<sup>2</sup></i> cos <i>ωt</i>. In other words, it will
become -<i>ω<sup>2</sup></i> times itself. Same thing there. The final
result is the acceleration is -<i>ω<sup>2</sup></i> times the position.
That means the acceleration is pointing towards the center of the
circle and it has a magnitude <i>a</i>. When I draw something without
an arrow, I'm talking about the magnitude. It is just
<i>ω<sup>2</sup>r</i>. I have shown you yesterday that the speed of the
particle as it goes around the circle is this (<i>ωr</i>).</p>

<p>Again, you should make sure you know how to derive this. You can do
it any way you like. You can take one full circle and realize the
distance traveled is 2<i>πr</i>, divide by the time and you will get
this. Another way, take the derivative of this, get the velocity vector
and you notice his magnitude is a constant and the constant will be
<i>ωr</i>. Whichever way you do it, you can then rewrite this as
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>r</i>. This is called the centripetal
acceleration. This is the acceleration directed toward the center. I
told you these are very important results. You've got to get this in
your head. Whenever you see a particle moving in a circle, even if it's
at a constant speed, it has an acceleration, <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>r</i> directed towards the center.</p>

<p>This formula doesn't tell you which way it's pointing, because it's
a scaler; it's not a vector equation. If you want to write it as a
vector equation, you want to write it as <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>r</i> minus--I want to say that it's pointing in the direction
toward the center. So sometimes what we do is we introduce a little
vector here called <i>e<sub>r</sub></i>. I'll tell you more about it
later. <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> is a vector at each point of length one
pointing radially away from the center. It's like the unit vector
<i>I</i>. Unit vector <i>I</i> points away from the origin in the
<i>x</i> direction. <i>J</i> points away from the origin in the
<i>y</i> direction. <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> is not a fixed vector. At each
point, <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> is a different vector pointing in the
radial direction of length one. The advantage of introducing that guy
is that if you like, I can now write an equation for the acceleration
as a vector. The magnitude is <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>r</i>. The
direction is <i>-e<sub>r</sub></i>. So <i>e<sub>r</sub></i> is a new
entity I've introduced for convenience. It plays a big role in
gravitation, in the Coulomb interaction. It's good to have a vector
pointing in the radial direction of length one. That's what it is.
That's really the heart of what I did last time. Then we did some
projectile problems. You shoot something, you should know when it will
land, where it will land, with what speed it will land, how high it
will go. I assume that those problems are not that difficult and I've
given you a lot of practice.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to move to the really important and central topic. I
guess you can guess what that is. We're going to talk about Newton's
laws. This is a big day in your life. This is when you learn the laws
in terms of which you can understand and explain a large number of
phenomena. In fact, until we do electricity and magnetism the next
semester, everything's going to be based on just the laws of Newton.
It's really amazing that somebody could condense that much information
into a few, namely three, different laws. That's what we're going to
talk about.</p>

<p>Let's start. Your reaction may be that you've seen Newton's laws,
you applied them in school. I've got to tell you that I realized fairly
late in life they are more subtle than I imagined the first time. It's
one thing to plug in all the numbers and say, "I know Newton's laws and
I know how they work." But as you get older and you have a lot of spare
time, you think about what you are doing, which is something I have the
luxury of doing right now, and I realized this is more tricky. I want
to share some of that with you so you can fast forward and get the
understanding it took me much longer to get. That's what I'm going to
emphasize, more than just plugging in the numbers. Of course, we have
to also know how to plug in the numbers so we can pass all the tests,
but it's good to understand the nature of the edifice set up by
Newton.</p>

<p>First statement by Newton--I don't feel like writing it down. It's
too long and everybody knows what the law is. It's called the Law of
Inertia. Let me just say it and talk about it. The Law of Inertia says
that, "If a body has no forces acting on it, then it will remain at
rest if it was at rest to begin with, or if it had a velocity to begin
with, it will maintain that velocity." One way to say it is, every body
will continue to remain in a state of rest or uniform motion in a
straight line. That's another way of saying maintaining velocity if
it's not acted upon by a force. What makes the law surprising is that
if I only gave you half the law, namely every body will remain at rest
if it's not acted upon by a force, you will say, "That's fine. I accept
that, because here's something. You leave it there, it doesn't move.
It's not a big surprise." People were used to that from the time of
Aristotle. But Aristotle used to think that if you want something to
move, there has to be some agency making it move. That agency you could
call force.</p>

<p>The great discovery that Galileo and Newton made is that you don't
need a force for a body to move at constant velocity. It's very clear
you don't need a force if something is doing nothing, just sitting
there. The fact that you don't need a force for it to move forever at a
given speed in a given direction, that's not obvious, because in daily
life you don't see that. In daily life, everything seems to come to
rest unless you push it or you pull it or you exert some kind of force.
But we all know that the reason things come to a halt when you push
them is, there eventually is some friction or drag or something
bringing them to rest. Somehow, if you could manufacture a really
smooth frictionless surface, that if you took a hockey puck or
something and an air cushion and you give it a push, in some idealized
world, it'll travel forever. So it's hard to realize that in the
terrestrial situation. But Galileo already managed to find examples
where things would roll on for a very, very long time. Nowadays, if you
go to outer space, you can check for yourself that if you throw
something out, it just goes on forever without your intervention. It's
in the nature of things to go at a constant velocity. They don't need
your help to do that.</p>

<p>You have to be careful that this first law of Newton is not valid
for everybody. In fact, I'll give an example in your own life where you
will find that this law doesn't work. Here is the situation. You go on
an airplane and then after the usual delays, the plane begins to
accelerate down the runway. At that instant, if you leave anything on
the floor, you know it's no longer yours. It's going to slide down and
the guy in the last row is going to collect everything. Why is that?
Because we find in that plane, when objects are left at what you think
is at rest with no external agency acting on them, they all slide
backwards towards the rear end of the plane. That happens during
takeoff. That doesn't happen in flight, but it happens during takeoff.
That is an example of a person for whom the Law of Inertia does not
work. This is something you guys may not have realized.</p>

<p>Newton's laws are not for everybody. You have to be what's called an
"inertial observer." If you're an inertial observer, then in your
system of reference, objects left at rest will remain at rest. The
plane that's ready to take off or is taking off is not such a system.
The Earth seems to be a pretty good inertial system, because on the
ground, you leave something, it stays there. It depends on what you
leave. If you leave your iPod, it's not going to stay there for very
long. But then you can trace it to some external forces, which are
carrying your iPod. But if you don't do anything, things stay.</p>

<p>Here is the main point. The point of Newton is, two things in the
Law of Inertia, which one may think is trivial. First, free velocity,
constant velocity can be obtained for free without doing anything.
There are people for whom this is true. For example, in outer space,
you've got an astronaut. You send something, you'll find it goes on
forever. Here's another thing. If you find one inertial observer,
namely one person for whom this Law of Inertia works, I can manufacture
for you an infinite number of other people for whom this is true. Who
are these other people? Do you know what I'm talking about? If I give
you one observer for whom the Law of Inertia is true, I say that others
for whom is also true. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Did you hear that? Let me repeat
that. First of all, if the Law of Inertia is valid for me, it's valid
for other people in the same room at rest with respect to me. Because
if I think it's not moving, you think it's not moving. That's just
fine. But suppose you are in a train and you're moving past me and you
look at this piece of chalk. Of course, everything in my room is going
backwards for you. But things which were at rest will move at a
constant velocity, opposite of the velocity that you have relative to
me. You will find that objects that are at constant initial velocity
maintain the velocity. If I am an inertial observer, another person
moving relative to me at constant velocity will also be an inertial
observer. Why? Because any velocity I ascribe to a particle or an
object, you will add a certain constant to it by the law of composition
of velocity. All velocities I see you will add a certain number to get
the velocities according to you. But adding a constant velocity to
objects does not change the fact that those which were maintaining
constant velocity still maintain a constant velocity. It's a different
constant velocity.</p>

<p>In particular, the things that I say are at rest, you will say are
moving backwards at the velocity that you have relative to me. Things
that I say are going at 50 miles per hour you may say are going at 80.
But 50 is a constant and 80 is a constant. Therefore, it's not that
there's only one fortunate family of inertial observers. There's
infinite number of them, but they're all moving relative to each other
at constant velocity. If the Earth is an inertial frame of reference,
if you go in a train relative to the Earth at constant velocity, you're
also inertial. But if you go on a plane which is accelerating, you're
no longer inertial. That's the main point. The point is that there are
inertial frames of reference. You must know the Earth is not precisely
inertial. The Earth has an acceleration. Can you tell me why I'm sure
the Earth has an acceleration? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Because it's moving in a circle.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's going around the Sun. Let's
imagine it's a circular orbit. Then we've just shown here, it's an
accelerated frame of reference. It just turns out that if you put the
<i>v<sup>2</sup></i> and you put the <i>r</i>, and <i>r</i> is 93
million miles, you will find the acceleration is small enough for us to
ignore. But there are effects of the Earth's acceleration, which we'll
demonstrate. The Focault pendulum is one example where you can see that
the Earth is rotating around its own axis. Then, the fact that the
Earth is going around the Sun. All of them mean it's really not
inertial, but it's approximately inertial. But if you go to outer space
nowadays, you can find truly inertial frames of reference.</p>

<p>That's the first law. The first law, if you want, if you want to
say, "Okay what's the summary of all of this?" The summary is that
constant velocity doesn't require anything. The reason it looks like a
tautology, because you look around, nothing seems to have its velocity
forever. Then you say, "Oh, that's because there's a force acting on
it." It looks like a tautology because you're never able to show me
something that moves forever at a constant velocity, because every time
you don't find such a thing, I give an excuse, namely, a force is
acting. But it's not a big con, because you can set up experiments in
free space far from everything, where objects will, in fact, maintain
their velocity forever. That's a possibility. It's a useful concept on
the Earth, because Earth is approximately inertial.</p>

<p>Now, we have come to the second law, which is "the law." This is the
law that we all memorize and learn. It says that, "If a body has an
acceleration, then you need a force and the relation of the force to
acceleration is this thing: <i>F = ma</i>" Now, I have to say a few
words about units. Acceleration is measured in meters per second
squared. Mass is measured in kilograms. So, the way to measure force is
in kilogram meters per second squared. But we get tired of saying that
long expression, so we're going to call that a Newton, right? If you
invented it, we'd call it whatever your name is, but this is the guy
who invented it, so it's called a Newton, usually denoted by a capital
N. A typical problem that you may have done in your first pass at
Newton's law, someone tells you a force of 36 Newtons is acting on a
mass of whatever, 4 kilograms; what's the acceleration? You divide and
you find it's 9 and you say, "Okay, I know what to do with Newton's
laws."</p>

<p>That's where I want to tell you that it's actually more complicated
than that. Let's really look at this equation. Take yourself back to
1600-whatever, whenever Newton was inventing these laws. You don't know
any of these laws. You have an intuitive definition of force. You sort
of know what force is. Somebody pushes you or pulls you. That's a
force. Suddenly, you are told there is a law. Are you better off in any
way? "Can you do anything with this law?" is what I'm asking you. What
can you do with this law? I give you Newton's law and say, "Good luck."
What will you do? What does it help you predict? Can you even tell if
it's true? Here's a body that's moving, right? I want you to tell me,
is Newton right? How are we going to check that? Well, you want to
measure the left-hand side and you want to measure the right-hand side.
If they're equal, maybe you will say the law is working. What can you
measure in this equation?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Force and acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> All right. Let's start with
acceleration. What's your plan for measuring acceleration if some
little thing is moving? What do you need to measure it?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: The change in velocity over the change
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, but what instruments will
you need to measure it? You are supposed to really measure it. What
will you ask me for?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: A watch.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> A watch? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> And what else?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> A ruler? Okay. That's right. You
don't mean Queen Elizabeth, right? You mean-- Very good. What you
really want--a ruler may not be enough, but maybe it's enough. So
here's the long ruler and here's this thing moving, right? You ask for
a Rolex so here's your watch. It's telling time. Tell me exactly what
you want to do to measure acceleration. What do you have to do? I want
the acceleration now. What will you measure? Okay, you go ahead. You
can try.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible] I would start with the object at rest
and then [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It may not be at rest to begin
with. It's doing its thing. It's going at some speed. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Measure the distance it travels over a constant
interval of time?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That'll give you the
velocity.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Well, if you do distance after one second versus
distance over the next second versus distance over a third second, you
see how it increases.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Good, in principle. Let me
repeat what he said. He said, first, let it go a little distance, take
the distance over time. That gives you the velocity now. Let it go a
little more, that gives you the velocity later. Take the difference of
the two velocities and divide by the difference of the two times, and
you've got the acceleration. Of course, you have allowed it to move a
finite distance in a finite time. What you should imagine doing is
making these three measurements more and more quickly. You need three
positional measurements. Now, a little later, and a little later later,
because between the first and second, you get a velocity, the second
and third you get another velocity. Their difference divided by the
difference in times is going to be the acceleration. But if you imagine
making these measurements more and more and more quickly, in the end,
you can measure what you can say is the acceleration now.</p>

<p>That's the meaning of the limit in calculus. You take <i>Δx</i> and
you take <i>Δt</i>. What's the meaning of <i>Δx</i> and <i>Δt</i> going
to 0? It means, measure them as quickly as you can. In the real world,
no one's going to measure it instantaneously, but we can make the
difference as small as we like. Mathematically, we can make it 0. In
that limit, we can measure velocity right now. That means we can also
measure velocity slightly later and make the slightly later come as
close to right now as we want. Then, that ratio will give you
acceleration. Acceleration is the easiest thing to measure of these
three quantities. We all have a good intuitive feeling for what
acceleration is. You want to test if what Newton told you is right. You
see an object in motion, you find <i>a</i> and you give <i>a</i> a
certain numerical value, 10 meters per second squared. But that's not
yet testing the equation, because you've got to find both sides. What
about the mass? What's the mass of this object? Anybody want to try
from this section here? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: You could use some sort of a standard unit of mass
and then a balance to measure the mass of something else, like put it
at a certain distance from the fulcrum on a scale and figure out the
relative mass.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay. His idea was the
following. You take a standard mass and you maybe go to a seesaw. You
put the standard mass here and you put some other fellow at the mass
you're looking at there. You add just the lengths and when it balances,
you can sort of tell what this mass is, right? But suppose you were in
outer space. There's no gravity. Then the seesaw will balance, even if
you put a potato on one side and an elephant on the other side. You
cannot tell the mass, because what you are doing now is appealing to
the notion of mass as something that's related to the pull of the Earth
on the object. But Newton's law is--You see, you've got to go back and
wipe out everything you know. If this is what you have, there is no
mention of the Earth in these equations. Yet, the notion of mass is
defined. It's not talking about the gravitational pull of the Earth on
an object. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: If you had an object that you say has a certain mass
that you don't know and then you took one that's the same density, but
say twice the size and you can see if it slows the force.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> But do you know what the force
on the body is? We don't know how to measure that either; do you agree?
We don't know what the force is, because we are hoping to say force is
going to be <i>m</i> times <i>a</i>. We're just getting on to measuring
<i>m</i>. It looks like a circular definition right now. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Do you mean what material this object is made of and
its density [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah, but density is mass over
volume. But we don't know the mass, right?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: But if you use the density of that [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> How is anyone going to give you
a density of anything? We're just asking what's the mass of any object?
We have not yet found a satisfactory answer to what's the mass of an
object? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Are we still operating in outer space?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. This cannot depend on the
planet Earth.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Could we have, by any chance, a spring?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Whose spring constant and the definition
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> I'm sorry. What did you just
say? You can have a spring.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Yeah, you could have a spring and you could compare
how fast that objects will travel when the spring is compressed and
they're placed against it and released, but you'd only have a
comparison then.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay. Let me repeat what he
said. He said, take a spring to outer space and we'll hook up some
objects to them and see how fast they move and do a comparison. That's
fairly close to what I had in mind. But it's not the word perfect
answer. I just want to take some time thinking about it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> What do I learn from the
period?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> How?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Remember, you cannot peek into
chapters 6 and 7, because you've seen it before. I'm asking you if
somebody wrote apparently Shakespeare's plays for him; it's one of the
rumors, right? Suppose Newton comes to you and says, "I have this great
law, but I don't want to publish it under my name. I'm going to give it
to you." You have got this new law, but how are you going to sell this?
You've got to tell people how to use it. You realize it's very subtle,
because the very first thing in that equation, which is <i>m</i>, has
not yet been defined. He gave an answer which is fairly close. It
doesn't rely on gravity. It doesn't rely on the planet. You cannot say
to me, "Take a force, due to a spring, and see what force it applies
and divide by the acceleration and get the mass," because we haven't
defined force either. You've got to realize that. Let me ask you
something. How do we decide how long a meter is? Can you tell me, how
do you know how long a meter is?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: It's just sort of arbitrary.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: You can just pick an arbitrary mass, as well, like
one object, which is an arbitrary mass.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> And we'll call it. First thing
you've got to do is, realize that some of these things are not
God-given. A meter, for example, is not deduced from anything. Napoleon
or somebody said, "The size of my ego is one meter." That's a new unit
of length. You take a material like silver and put it in a glass case
and that's the definition of a meter. It's not right or wrong. Then I
ask you, "What is two meters and what is three meters?" We have ways of
doing that. I take the meter and put it next to the meter, that's two
meters. I cut it in half, I'll use some protractors and dividers and
compasses, you can split the meter into any fraction you like. Likewise
for mass, we will take a chunk of some material and we will call it a
kilogram. I should give you some hint. That kilogram, I don't expect
you to deduce. That is a matter of convention. Just like one second is
some convention we use and one meter is some convention we use. I'm
going to give you a little help. I'm going to give you a glass case and
in the glass case is an entity with this as one kilogram, by
definition. Then I give you another object, an elephant. Here's an
elephant. I'm telling you, "What's the mass of the elephant?" How do
you find this mass? You got to take the hint he gave. I give you a
spring and an elephant. What should we do? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Measure how far, if you hung an elephant from a
spring [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. Remember, when we hang the
elephant in outer space, nothing is going to happen.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Okay. You push the elephant and measure how far--
what the distance from the unstretched spring is that the elephant
travels in either direction.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Then, you also do that with one kilogram. It should
be proportional to how far from the resting state of the spring. That
should be the proportion that the one kilogram object is to the
other.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> When you say, "push the
elephant," you want to push it in a particular way? What do you want to
do?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Towards the [inaudible] to compress the spring or to
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That is correct, but you don't
want to give it a definite push. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Do you push it radially along the axis of the
spring, because you know that the centripetal force is mv<sup>2</sup>
is over t.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah. Maybe that's an
interesting thing. That's correct. You can do that, too. Let me now put
you out of your suspense. I think I've heard bits and pieces of the
answer everywhere, so I don't want to wait until we get it
word-perfect. The point is, the one kilogram is a matter of convention.
We want to know what is the mass of the elephant. We can do the seesaw
experiment, you suggested, but the seesaw experiment requires gravity,
so we don't want to do that. A spring will, on the other hand, exert a
force. We don't know what the force of the spring is. If you assume
that, you are not playing by the rule, because we don't know what force
it exerts. We do know it exerts a force, so here's what you do. You
hook one end of the spring to a wall and you pull it from rest by some
amount and you attach the one kilogram mass to it. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: One problem that we'd have, though, is if we're in
outer space, where are we going to find a wall that won't move?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> A wall that will not move?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Actually, if you hook it up to any wall in outer
space [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You're right. What can actually
happen is that if you're in an enormous laboratory, which is made up of
an enormous object, then you will find that you can, in fact, attach it
to the wall. You can go in outer space--</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: It won't move very much?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, it won't move very much.
Once we know enough dynamics, we can answer your question. Does outer
space even rob you of something to which you can anchor a spring? The
answer is, "no." You can anchor things to objects in outer space. They
just won't act the way gravity does. But you can nail it to the wall
and pull one end. So you pull one end. We don't know what force it
exerts. But it exerts some force. Now, I tie this one kilogram mass to
it and let it go. I find the acceleration. That is the force which I do
not know in magnitude. But this is the acceleration of the one kilogram
mass. Then, I bring the elephant and I pull the spring by the same
amount and I find the acceleration of the elephant and the denominator
is obviously the mass of the elephant. The force is not known, but it's
the same force. So, when I divide these two numbers, I'm going to find
<i>a<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>a<sub>E</sub></i> is equal to
<i>m<sub>E</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, which is the one kilogram mass.
What we needed was some mechanism of exerting some fixed force. We
didn't have to know its magnitude. But the acceleration it produces on
the elephant and on the mass, are in an inverse ratio of their masses.
If you knew this was one kilogram, then the acceleration of the
elephant, which will be some tiny number, maybe 100<sup>th</sup> of
what this guy did; the mass of the elephant is then 100 kilograms.</p>

<p>Note there are, again, subtleties even here. If you think harder,
you can get worried about other things. For example, how do I know that
when I pull the spring the first time for the mass, it exerted the same
force when I pulled the spring the second time for the elephant? After
all, springs wear out. That's why you change your shock absorbers in
your car. After a while, they don't do the same thing. First, we got to
make sure the spring exerts a fixed force every time. You can say, "How
am I going to check that? I don't have the definition of force yet."
But we do know the following. If I pull the one kilogram mass and I let
it go, it does something, some acceleration. Then, I pull it again by
the same amount and let it go; I do it 10 times. If every time I get
the same acceleration, I'm convinced this is a reliable spring that is
somehow producing the same force under the same condition. On the
eleventh time, I pull the mass. I will put the elephant in. With some
degree of confidence, I'm working with a reliable spring and then I
will get the mass of the elephant.</p>

<p>Why is it so important? It's important for you guys to know that
everything you write down in the notebook or blackboard as a symbol is
actually a measured quantity. You should know at all times how you
measure anything. If you don't know how to measure anything, you are
doing algebra and trigonometry. You are not doing physics. This also
tells you that the mass of an object has nothing to do with
gravitation. Mass of an object is how much it hates to accelerate in
response to a force. Newton tells you forces cause acceleration. But
the acceleration is not the same on different objects. Certain objects
resist it more than others. They are said to have a bigger mass. We can
be precise about how much bigger by saying, "If the acceleration of a
body to a given force is ten times that of a one kilogram mass, then
this mass is one-tenth of one kilogram." This is how masses can be
tabulated using a spring.</p>

<p>Imagine then from now on, we can find the mass of any object, right?
We know now with the same spring, by this comparison, we will find. All
objects now can be attributed a mass. Then we may, from this equation,
say a certain force is acting in a given situation by multiplying the
<i>m</i> times the <i>a</i>. Then, here is what we actually do. Now, we
go back to the spring. We go back to the spring and we want to learn
something about the spring. We want to know how much force it exerts
when I pull it by a certain amount. Now I can measure that, because I
pull it by one centimeter and I find the acceleration it exerts on a
known mass. That <i>m</i> times <i>a</i> is the force the spring is
exerting. Then I pull it by 1.1 cm, and I find <i>ma</i>. I find 1.2, I
find <i>ma</i>. I draw a graph here of the amount by which I pull the
spring versus the force it exerts. It will typically look like this and
the formula we say is <i>F = -kx</i>, where <i>k</i> is called "the
force constant."</p>

<p>You got to understand what the minus sign is doing here. This is the
force exerted by the spring on the mass. It says, if you pull it to the
right, so that <i>x</i> is positive, the spring will exert a force
which is in the negative direction; that's why you have a minus sign.
Then, all springs will do something like this. Further out they can do
various things. The force may taper off, the force may not be given by
a straight line, but for modest deformations, every spring will have a
linear regime in which the force is linearly proportional to the
stretching. It also tells you that if you compress the spring, compress
it means <i>x</i> is now--<i>x</i> is measured from this position,
where the spring is neither compressed nor expanded. So <i>x</i> is not
really the coordinate of the end point. You've got to understand that.
Springs have a natural length; <i>x</i> is measured from that length.
If it's positive, it means you've stretched it, if it's negative, it
means compressed. This equation is telling you if you compress it,
namely if <i>x</i> is negative, <i>F</i> will be then positive, because
it's pushing you outwards. Therefore, what we have done now is, we can
take all kinds of springs and we can calibrate the force they will
exert under various conditions. Namely, if you pull it by so much,
that's the force it will exert.</p>

<p>I want you to think for a second about two equations. One equation
says <i>F = ma</i>. Other equation says <i>F=-kx</i>. What's going on?
Is one of them Newton's law? Then what's the other one? Maybe <i>F =
-kx</i> should be called Newton's law? Why is <i>F = ma</i> called
Newton's law? Then, what's the meaning of this expression? What's the
difference between saying <i>F = -kx</i> and <i>F = ma</i>? They are
saying very different things. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: <i>F = ma</i> is a universal law.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right. Let me repeat. <i>F =
ma</i> is universally true, independent of the nature of the force
acting on a body. Then?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: <i>F = -kx</i> is only describing how the spring
is.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Very good. That's the whole
point. The cycle of Newtonian dynamics has two parts. First one says,
if you knew the force acting on any body, without going into what
caused the force, then you may set that force equal the mass times
acceleration of the body. We think of force as the cause and <i>a</i>
as the result or the effect. Force causes acceleration and this is a
precise statement. There, Newton doesn't tell you what forces are going
to be acting on a body in a given situation. If you leave the body
alone, maybe there's no force acting on it. If you connect the body to
a spring, which is neither compressed nor extended, there's no force
acting on it. If you pull the spring, there is a force acting on it.
Newton is not going to come and tell you what force the spring will
exert when it's pulled by some amount. That is another part of your
assignment. The physicist has to constantly find out what forces act on
bodies. That's a separate exercise.</p>

<p>In every context in which I place a body, I'll have to know what are
the forces acting on it. I've got to find them by experimenting, by
putting other bodies and seeing how they react and then finding out
what's the force that acts on a body when it's placed in this or that
situation. Once you've got that, then you come back. In the case of a
spring, this is the law that you will deduce. If it's something else,
you will have to deduce another law. For example, we know that if a
body is near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity and that
object seems to be <i>m</i> times <i>g</i>, where <i>g</i> is 9.8.
That's something you find out by experiment. Every time you are finding
out a different force that's acting on a body with different origin.
One says, leave any body near the Earth, it yields a force. I know this
is the right answer, because if I now find the acceleration, I find
it's <i>mg</i> divided by <i>m</i> and I get <i>-g</i> as the answer
for all bodies.</p>

<p>By the way, that's a very remarkable property of the gravitational
force--the cancellation of the two <i>m</i>s. If you look at the
electrical force, the force of electricity, on the proton and electron
or something, it's not proportional to the mass of either object. It's
proportional to the electric charge of either object. Therefore, when
you divide by the mass to get the acceleration, the response of
different bodies is inverse to the mass. But gravity has a remarkable
property that the pull of the Earth is itself proportional to the
inertia of the object. So, when you divide by <i>m</i>, <i>m</i>
cancels and everything falls at the same rate on the surface of the
Earth. In fact, there's a property of gravitational fields anywhere,
even in outer space, but there is some residual field between all the
planets and all the stars in the universe, that the force on a body is
proportional to the mass of the body. So, when you divide by the mass
to get the acceleration, you get the same answer. Everything -- gold,
silver, diamonds, particles -- everything accelerates the same way in a
gravitational field, due to this remarkable fact.</p>

<p>This was known for a long time, but it took Mr. Einstein to figure
out why nature is behaving in that fashion. If I have some time, I'll
tell you later. But there are two qualities which happen to be equal.
One is inertial mass, which is how much you hate your velocity to
change, how hard you resist acceleration. That exists far from planets,
far from everything. Other is gravitational mass, which is the measure
of how much you're attracted to the Earth. There's no reason why these
two attributes had to be proportional, but they are proportional and
they are equal by choice of units and you can ask, "Is this just an
accident or is it part of a big picture?" It turns out, it's part of a
big picture and all of general relativity is based on this one great
equivalence of two quantities which are very different attributes. Why
should the amount by which you're attracted to the Earth be also a
measure of how much you hate acceleration? Two different features,
right? But they happen to be the same.</p>

<p>Anyway, what physicists do is they put bodies in various
circumstances and they deduce various forces. This is the force of
gravity. This is the force of the spring. Here's another force you
might find. You put a chunk of wood on a table and you try to move it
at constant speed. Then you find that you have to apply minimum force.
We are moving at constant velocity. That means the force you're
applying is cancelled by another force, which has got to be the force
of friction. So force of friction is yet another force. Then, there are
other forces. You guys know there is the electrical force. If you bring
a plus charge near a plus charge, if my body <i>m</i>, has a plus
charge and another plus charge is there, it'll feel a force due to
that. That's not going to be given by Newton. So, Newton did not ever
tell you what the expression for force is in a given context. That is a
constant study. Coulomb discovered the Coulomb's law, which is a
repulsion between charges. Nowadays we know if you go into the neutron
or the proton, there are quarks. There are forces between the quarks.
You can ask what the force that this quark will exert and that quark at
a certain separation. That was obviously not known to Newton.</p>

<p>Remember, Newton said <i>F = ma</i>, but didn't tell you what value
<i>F</i> has in a given context. He just said whenever there's an
acceleration, it's going to be due to some forces and it's your job to
find what the forces are. To find the force, what you will do is,
suppose somebody says, "Hey, I've got a new force. Every time I go near
the podium, I find I'm drawn to it." Okay, that's a new force. The word
gets around and we want to measure the force. What do I do? I stand
near this podium. I'm drawn to it. I cannot stop. I tie a spring to my
back and I anchor it to the wall and see how much the spring stretches
before the two forces balance. Then I know that <i>kx</i> is equal to
the force this is exerting at this separation. I move a little closer
and I find the stretching is a different number. Maybe the force is
getting stronger. That's how by either balancing the unknown force with
a known force or by simply measuring the acceleration as I fall towards
this podium and multiplying by mass, you can find the force that exerts
on me. It's not a cyclical and useless definition. It's a very
interesting interplay and that's the foundation of all of mechanics. We
are constantly looking for values of <i>F</i> and we're constantly
looking for responses or bodies to a known force.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of a complete Newtonian problem. A mass is
attached to a spring. It is pulled by a certain amount <i>x</i>, and is
released. What is it going to do? We go to Newton. Newton says <i>F =
ma</i>, so to make it a useful result of this problem, we know the mass
of this guy. We did the comparison with the elephant or something;
<i>a</i> is the second derivative of <i>x</i> and for this problem,
when <i>F</i> is due to a spring, we know the force is that by studying
the spring. Suddenly, you have a mathematically complete problem.
Mathematically complete problem is that you can find the function
<i>x(t)</i> by saying that the second derivative of the function is
equal to <i>-k</i> over <i>m</i> times the function. Then, you go to
the Math Department and say, "Please tell me what's the answer to this
equation?" We don't have to worry about how you solve it, but it's
problem in mathematics and the answer will be--surprise, it's going to
be oscillating back and forth and that'll come out of the wash. This is
how you formulate problems.</p>

<p>You can formulate another problem. Later on, we know about gravity.
Newton finds out there's a force of gravity acting on everything.
Here's the Sun. Here's your planet. At this instant, the planet may be
moving at that speed. Then the acceleration of the planet is the force
of gravity between the planet and the Sun, which Newton will tell you
is directed towards the Sun and it depends on how far you are.
Depending on how far the planet is from the Sun and where it's located,
you will get the left-hand side. That's another law. That's the Law of
Universal Gravitation. Then again, you will find the evolution of the
planetary motion, because the rate of change of the position is
connected to the position. Again, go to the math guys and say, "What's
the answer to that?" and they tell you the answer, which will be some
elliptical motion. Okay.</p>

<p>By the way, Mr. Newton did not have math guys he could go to. Not
only did he formulate laws of gravitation, he also invented calculus
and he also learned how to solve the differential equation for
calculus. He probably felt that nobody around was doing any work,
because all the thing was given to this one person. It's really amazing
that what Newton did in the case of gravity was to find the expression
for this. A few years earlier he had also gotten this law. By putting
the two together, out comes the elliptical motion of the planets. We'll
come back to that, but you have to understand the structure of
Newtonian mechanics. Generally, any mechanics will require knowledge of
the force.</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to add one more amendment. You don't have to write in
your notebook, but you've got to remember. Maybe you'll but a little
<i>T</i> and circle it. Let me write it here. <i>F<sub>T</sub></i>
means the total force on a body. You've got many forces acting on a
body. The acceleration is controlled by the sum. If I'm now working in
one dimension, it's obvious because I'm not using any vectors. Then,
you may have forces to the right, forces to the left pushing, pulling.
You add them all up algebraically, keeping track of their sign, and
that's the total force. That's connected to mass times
acceleration.</p>

<p>Now, I'll give you the third law. The third law says that if there
are two bodies, called one and two, force of one on two is minus the
force of the second on the first one. This is the thing about action
and reaction. All the laws that anybody knows have this property. What
does it require to be a successful mechanic, to do all the mechanics
problems? You got to be good at writing down the forces acting on a
body. That's what it's all going to boil down to. Here is my advice to
you. Do not forget the existing forces and do not make up your own
forces. I've seen both happen. Right now at this point in our course,
whenever you have a problem where there is some body and someone says,
"Write all the forces on it", what you have to do is very simple.</p>

<p>Every force, with one exception, can be seen as a force due to
direct contact with the body. Either a rope is pulling, a rope is
pushing it, you are pushing it, you are pulling it. That's a contact on
the body. If nothing is touching the body, there are no forces on it,
with one exception which is, of course, gravity. Gravity is one force
that acts on a body without the source of the force actually touching
it. That's it. Do not draw any more forces. People do draw other
forces. When a body is going around a circle, they say that's some
centrifugal force acting. There is no such thing. Be careful. Whenever
there is a force, it can be traced back to a tangible material cause,
which is all the time a force of contact, with the exception of
gravity. Okay, so with that, if you write the right forces, you will be
just fine. You will be able to solve all the problems we have in
mechanics.</p>

<p>I'm going to now start doing simple problems in mechanics. They will
start out simple and, as usual, they will get progressively more
difficult. Let's start with our first triumph will be motion in 1D.
Here is some object, it's 5 kilograms and I apply 10 Newtons. Someone
says, "What's the acceleration?" Everyone knows it is 10 over 5 equals
2. Now we know how we got all the numbers that go into the very
question. How do we know 10 Newtons is acting? I think you people know
how we can say that with confidence. How do we know the mass of this is
5 kilograms? We know how you got that from an earlier experiment. Now,
we know how the numbers come in. The algebra is, of course, very
trivial here.</p>

<p>Then, the next problem is a little more interesting. Here I got 3 kg
and I got 2 kg and I'm pushing with 10 Newtons and I want to know what
happens. One way is to just use your common sense and realize that if
you push it this way, these two guys are going to move together. And
know intuitively that if they move together, they will behave like an
object of mass 5 and the acceleration will again be 2. But there's
another way to do this and I'm going to give you now the simplest
example of the other way, which is to draw free-body diagrams. By the
way, when I say there's 10 Newtons acting this way, you might say,
"What about gravity? What about the table?" Imagine that this is in
outer space where there is no gravity for now. The motion is just along
the <i>x</i> axis.</p>

<p>The free-body diagram, it says you can pick any one body that you
like and apply <i>F = ma</i> to it, provided you identify all the
forces acting on that body. We'll first pick the body, with mass 3.
Here's the body of mass 3. What are the forces on it? This is certainly
acting on it. Then, you have to ask, "What other force is acting?" Here
is where you have to think. Anybody want to guess from the last row
what force? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: The reactive force of 2 on 3?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right. So let's give it a name.
Let's point it that way and call it <i>F2</i> on 3. That's the end of
this guy. Let's look at the other fellow. Maybe you should complete the
force acting on this one. Can you tell me what it is? Same person in
the last row.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> And how big is that?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: The same as <i>F2</i>, 3.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right. I don't want to give it
too many different names, because <i>F2</i>, 3 and <i>F3</i>, 2 are
equal and opposite. I'm already showing <i>F2</i>, 3 acting to the
left. Let me give it some other name like <i>f</i>. Then you agree this
will be the same <i>f</i> but pointing that way. Here is the mistake
some people make. They add to that the 10 Newtons. It's the 10 Newtons
acting on it, because I know the 10 Newton is pushing me and I'm going
to feel it even if I'm here. That will be a mistake. That's an example
of adding a force that you really shouldn't be adding. The only force
acting on this guy is this little <i>f</i>. That's, in turn, because
this guy's being pushed by the 10 Newtons, but that's not your problem.
Your problem is to only look at the forces of contact on you, and that
is just this <i>f</i>. Then we do <i>F = ma</i> for these two guys. For
this guy, <i>F = ma</i> will be 10 minus <i>f</i> is 3 times <i>a</i>.
The other one, it'll be <i>f =</i> 2<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Notice I'm using the same acceleration for both. I know that if the
second mass moved faster than the first one, then the picture is
completely wrong. If it moved slower than the first one, it means it's
rammed into this one. That also cannot happen, so they're moving with
the same acceleration. There's only one unknown <i>a</i>. Once you got
this, you realize what you got to do. This equation is begging you to
be added to this equation. You got a plus <i>f</i> and a minus
<i>f</i>, so you got to do what you got to do. You add the two, you get
10 = 5<i>a</i> and you get <i>a</i> = 2. Once you got <i>a</i> = 2, you
can go back and realize here that <i>f</i> = 4, so you got really 4
Newtons. Now, we know the full story. 4 Newtons acting on 2 kg, gives
you an acceleration of 2. On this guy, I have 10 from the left and I
have 4--10 acting this way, 4 acting that way. That is 6 Newtons
divided by 3 kg is also an acceleration of 2. This is a simpler
example. A simple example of free body diagrams. Very simple. If you
can do this, you can do most of the problems you will run into. Just
don't add stuff that's not there. That's all you have to be careful
about. The stuff that people tend to add sometimes is to keep drawing
the 10 Newtons that's acting on that.</p>

<p>Now, here's another variation. The variation looks like this. I got
3 kg and I have a rope. I got 2 kg and I pull this guy with 10 Newtons.
What's going to happen? Again, your common sense tells you, "Look, you
are pulling something whose effective mass seems to be 5, the answer is
2." Let's get that systematically by using free-body diagrams. Now,
there are really three bodies here. Block one and block two and the
rope connecting them. In all these examples, this rope is assumed to be
massless. We know there is no thing called a massless rope, but most
ropes have a mass, but maybe negligible compared to the two blocks you
are pulling, so we'll take the idealized limit where the mass of the
rope is 0. Here is the deal. 3 kg is being pulled by the rope on the
right with a force that I'm going to call <i>T</i>, which stands for
tension. The rope is being pulled backwards by this guy, the <i>T</i>.
What is the force on the other side? What should that be? Who said
<i>T</i>? Why is it definitely <i>T</i> and not something else? What
would happen if it's something else?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: If it was greater, then the rope would snap. Well,
if it was greater [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It won't snap, but something
else will be a problem. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Not only faster, but what will
be its acceleration? If the two forces don't cancel, you have a net
force. What are you going to divide by to get the acceleration?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Zero, right? So, a massless body
cannot have a net force on it, because the acceleration of the rope
cannot be infinite. In fact, it has to be some finite number, which is
the acceleration of either of these two guys. So, massless bodies will
always have, like a massless rope, equal and opposite forces on the two
ends. That is called the tension on the rope. When you say the rope is
under tension being pulled from both sides by a certain force, the
tension is not 0 just because this <i>T</i> and that <i>T</i> cancel.
It's true the net force is 0, but it doesn't mean you can ignore it.
Suppose you are being pulled by my favorite animals -- the elephants --
from both sides by equal force. You don't find any consolation in the
fact that these forces add up to 0. You feel the pain. That pain is
what--This gentleman doesn't agree. One of you guys nodding your head.
Do you feel the pain? Do you agree? Okay. That force is called a
tension. Whenever you're asked on a problem, "What's the tension on the
rope?" you're looking for that equal and opposite forces acting at two
ends of the rope. We don't know what it is. We'll give it a name, but
by linking that <i>T</i> to that <i>T</i>, we can also figure out the
same <i>T</i> must be exerted on this one by Newton's third law,
because if this block is the only one that could be pulling this rope
with <i>T</i>. Therefore, the ropes will be pulling the block with
<i>T</i> in the other direction, then I got 10 Newtons here.</p>

<p>Now, you can do <i>F = ma</i> for the three different objects.
There's nothing to do here, because the forces are 0, the mass is 0. It
doesn't tell you anything. The first one tells you <i>T</i> =
3<i>a</i>. The other one tells you 10 - <i>T</i> = 2<i>a</i>. Again, we
know what to do. We add these numbers and we get 10 = 5<i>a</i>.
Therefore, we find <i>a</i> = 2. Once you find <i>a</i> = 2, you find
<i>T</i> = 6. So, tension on the rope is 6 Newtons. This is very
important, because when you buy a rope, they will tell you how much
tension it can take before it'll snap. If your plan is to accelerate a
3 kg mass with an acceleration of 2 meters per second, you better have
a rope that can furnish that force and it can take the tension of 6
Newtons.</p>

<p>Now, for the- whoa! I'm going to give the last class a problem which
is pretty interesting, which is what happens to you when you have an
elevator. Here is a weighing machine and that's you standing on the
elevator. We're going to ask, "What's the needle showing at different
times?" First, take the case in the elevator is on the ground floor of
some building and completely addressed. Then, let's look at the spring.
The spring is getting squashed because you are pushing down and the
floor is pushing up. You are pushing down with the weight <i>mg</i>,
and the floor has got to be pushing up with the <i>md</i>, because the
spring is not going anywhere. So the spring is being pushed by
<i>mg</i> here and <i>mg</i> here. Therefore, it'll compress by an
unknown <i>x</i>, which is equal to <i>mg</i> divided by the force
constant of the spring.</p>

<p>By the way, that is a subtle thing people may not have realized.
Even in the case of this spring, when you pull it, if you pull it to
the right by some force. Remember, the wall is pulling to the left with
the same force. So springs are always pushed or pulled on either side
with the same force. We focus on one because we are paying for it, but
the wall is doing the opposite. We don't pay any attention to that. You
cannot have a spring pulled only at one side, because then it will then
accelerate with infinite acceleration in that direction. This spring is
getting squashed on either side, and it'll squash by certain amount
<i>x</i>, that depends on your mass, and that <i>x</i> will be turned
into a motion of a needle and that'll read your mass.</p>

<p>Now, what happens if the elevator is accelerating upwards with an
acceleration <i>a</i>? That's the question. The way I analyze it is, I
say, if I look at me and I write the forces on me, that is <i>mg</i>
acting down, then we use <i>w</i> as the symbol to represent the force
exerted by the spring; <i>w</i> - <i>mg</i> = <i>ma</i>. That is, <i>F
= ma</i>. When I was not accelerating and everything was at rest,
<i>ma</i> was 0, <i>w</i> was <i>mg</i>, and <i>w</i> was the reading
on the needle. But if I'm accelerating, the force exerted by the spring
and therefore, the needle the weighing machine reads is <i>m</i> times
<i>g</i> plus <i>a</i>. It means, when you are accelerating upwards, as
the elevator picks up speed, the reading on the spring will be more and
you will feel heavy. You feel heavy and it reads more because the poor
spring not only has to support you from falling through the floor, but
also accelerate you counter to what gravity wants to do. That's why it
is <i>g</i> plus <i>a</i>. So, you picked up some speed, then you're
coasting along at a steady speed. Then, <i>a</i> drops out and you
weigh your normal self. As you come to the top of the building, the
elevator has to decelerate, so that it loses its positive velocity and
comes to rest. So <i>a</i> will be negative and <i>w</i>, in fact, will
be less than <i>mg</i>. So, you will feel weightless for a short time
or you'll feel your weight is little. Then, you come to rest and the
opposite happens on the way down.</p>

<p>Let me just briefly look at the ride on the way down. As you start
on the top and go down, your acceleration is negative. Remember, you've
got to keep track of the sign of acceleration, so if you're picking up
speed towards the ground, <i>a</i> is negative, so it will be <i>g</i>
plus <i>a</i>, but <i>a</i> is a negative number. Let me write it as
<i>g</i> minus the absolute value of <i>a</i>. You can see that if
<i>a</i> was equal to <i>g</i>, your downward acceleration is that of
gravity, namely the cable has snapped in the elevator, then you don't
feel any weight. You don't feel any weight because your weight is the
opposition you get to falling through the floor; but if the floor is
giving way and you're just falling freely, you feel weightless. It's
wrong to think that you feel weightless because you escaped the pull of
gravity. We all know that in a falling elevator, you definitely do not
escape the pull of gravity. It's going to catch up with you in a few
seconds. Likewise, when in outer space, when you are orbiting the
Earth, people are always floating around in these space stations. They
have not escaped the pull of gravity either. They have just stopped
fighting it. If you escape the pull of gravity, your spaceship will be
off, won't be orbiting the Earth. Anyway, I will return to this next
time. Do your problems. There's quite a few problems. You should start
them right away.</p>
