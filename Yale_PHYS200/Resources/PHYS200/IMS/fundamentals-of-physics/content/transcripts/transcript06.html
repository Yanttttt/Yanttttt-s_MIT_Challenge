<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Let me remind you what I said
last time in terms of mathematical preparation -- very simple -- I will
repeat it one time. If you've got a function <i>f(x)</i>, you know the
value at some point, and you want to go to a neighboring point, a
distance <i>Δx</i> away. You ask, "How much does the function change?"
And the answer is, the change in the function <i>Δf</i> is the
derivative of the function at the starting point times the distance you
move. This is not an equality, unless <i>f</i> happens to be a straight
line; it's an approximation and there are corrections to this. That's
what all the dots mean; corrections are proportional to
<i>Δx<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>Δx<sup>3</sup></i> and so on. But if
<i>Δx</i> is tiny this will do; that's it.</p>

<p>But today, we are going to move the whole Work Energy Theorem and
the Law of Conservation of Energy to two dimensions. So, when you go to
two dimensions, you've got to ask yourself, "What am I looking for?"
Well, in the end, I'm hoping I will get some relation like
<i>K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub></i>,
assuming there is no friction. <i>U<sub>2</sub></i> is going to be my
new potential energy. Then, if it's the potential energy and the
particle is moving in two dimensions, it's got to be a function of two
variables, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. So, I have to make sure that you guys
know enough about functions of more than one variable. So, this is,
again, a crash course on reminding you of the main points. There are
not that many. By the time I get here I'll be done.</p>

<p>So, how do you visualize the function of two variables? The function
of one variable, you know, you plot <i>x</i> this way and the function
along <i>y</i>. If it's two variables, you plot <i>x</i> here and
<i>y</i> here and the function itself is shown by drawing some surface
on top of the <i>xy</i> plane, so that if you take a point and you go
right up till you hit the surface, that's the value of the function, at
that point <i>xy</i>. It's like a canopy on top of the <i>xy</i> plane
and how high you've got to go is the function. For example, starting
with the floor, I can ask how high you have to go till I hit the
ceiling. That function varies; there are dents and dimples and so on,
so the function varies with <i>xy</i>. Another example of a function of
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>--<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> could be coordinates in
the United States and the function could be the temperature at that
point. So, you plot it on top of that, each point you plot the
temperature at that point.</p>

<p>So, once you've got the notion of a function of two variables, if
you're going to do calculus the next thing is what about the
derivatives of the function. How does it change? Well, in the old days,
it was dependent on <i>x</i> and I changed the <i>x</i> and I found the
change in the function divided by the change in <i>x</i> and took the
limit and that became my derivative. And now, I'm sitting in the
<i>xy</i> plane, so here is <i>x</i> and here is <i>y</i>; I'm here,
the function is coming out of the blackboard. So, imagine something
measured out but I'm sitting here. Now, I want to move and ask how the
function changes. But now I have a lot of options; in fact, an infinite
number of options. I can move along <i>x</i>, I can move along
<i>y</i>, I can move at some intermediate angle, we have to ask what do
you want me to do when it comes time to take derivatives. So, it turns
out, and you will see it proven amply as we go along, that you just
have to think about derivatives on two principle directions which I
will choose to be <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>So, we're going to define one derivative, which is defined as
follows. You start at the point <i>xy</i>, you go to the point <i>x</i>
+ <i>Δx</i>, the same <i>y</i> and subtract the function at the
starting point, divide by <i>Δx</i> and take all the limits, <i>Δx</i>
goes to 0. That means you go from here to here, you move a distance
<i>Δx</i>, you'd find the change in the function, you take the
derivative. As you move horizontally, you notice you don't do anything
to <i>y</i>; <i>y</i> will be left fixed at whatever <i>y</i> you had;
<i>x</i> will be changed by <i>Δx</i>; you find the change; you take
the derivative and take the limit that is denoted by the symbol
<i>df/dx.</i></p>

<p>[Reader note: Partial derivatives will be written as ordinary
derivatives to avoid using fonts that may not be universally available.
It should be clear from the context that a partial derivative is
intended here, since <i>f</i> depends on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.]</p>

<p>So, this curly <i>d</i> instead of the straight <i>d</i> tells you
it's called a "partial derivative." Some people may want to make it
very explicit by saying this is the derivative with subscript <i>y</i>.
That means <i>y</i> is being held constant when <i>x</i> is varied, but
we don't have to write that because we know we've got two coordinates.
If I'm changing one, the other guy is <i>y</i> so we won't write that;
that's the partial derivative. So, you can also move from here to here,
up and down, and see how the function changes. I won't write the
details, you can define obviously a <i>df/dy</i>. So, one tells you how
the function changes, with <i>x</i> I should move along <i>x</i>, and
the other tells you how it changes at <i>y</i> as you move along
<i>y</i>.</p>

<p>Let's get some practice. So, I'm going to write some function, <i>f
= x<sup>3</sup>y<sup>2</sup></i>, that's a function of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>. You can write any--let's make it a little more interesting,
plus <i>y</i>, or <i>y<sup>2</sup></i>; that's some function of
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. So, when I say <i>df/dx</i>, the rule is find
out how it varies with <i>x</i> keeping <i>y</i> constant. That means,
really treat it like a constant, because number five--What will you do
if <i>y</i> was equal to 5? This'll be 25 and it's not part of taking
derivatives because it's not changing, and here it'll be just standing
in front doing nothing; it will just take the <i>x</i> derivative,
treating <i>y</i> as a constant. You're supposed to do that here; this
is a derivative 3<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i>; so that's the <i>x</i>
derivative. Now, you can take the <i>y</i> part, <i>y<sup>2</sup></i>,
yes, thank you. Then, I can take <i>df/dy</i>, so then I look for
<i>y</i> changes, this is 2<i>y</i> here, so it's
2<i>x<sup>3</sup>y</i> + 2<i>y</i>; so that's the <i>x</i> derivative
and the partial <i>y</i> derivative.</p>

<p>Okay, so then you can now take higher derivatives. We know that from
calculus and one variable, you can take the derivative of the
derivative. So, one thing you can think about is
<i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dx<sup>2</sup></i>, that really means take the
<i>d</i> by <i>dx</i> of the <i>d</i> by <i>dx</i>. That's what it
means. First, take a derivative and take the derivative of the
derivative. So, let's see what I get here. I already took <i>df/dx</i>.
I want to take its derivative, right, the derivative of
<i>x<sup>2</sup></i> is 2<i>x</i>, so I get 6<i>xy<sup>2</sup></i>.
Then, I can take the <i>y</i> derivative of the <i>y</i> derivative,
<i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dy<sup>2</sup></i>, that's <i>d</i> by <i>dy</i> of
<i>df/dy</i>, if you take the <i>y</i> derivative there. You guys
should keep an eye out for me when I do this. I get this. But now, we
have an interesting possibility you didn't have in one dimension, which
is to take the <i>x</i> derivative of the <i>y</i> derivative, so I
want to take <i>d</i> by <i>dx</i> of <i>df/dy</i>. That is written as
<i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dxdy</i>. Let's see what I get. So, I want the
<i>x</i> derivative of the <i>y</i> derivative. So, I go to this guy
and take his <i>x</i> derivative, I get 3<i>x<sup>2</sup></i> from
there, so I get 6<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i> and that's it. So, make sure
that I got the proper <i>x</i> derivative of this, I think that's fine.
Then, I can also take <i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dydx</i>. That means, take the
<i>y</i> derivative of the <i>x</i> derivative, but here's the <i>x</i>
derivative, take the <i>y</i> derivative of that, put a 2<i>y</i>
there, and I get 6<i>x<sup>2</sup>y</i>.</p>

<p>So, you're supposed to notice something. If you already know this,
you're not surprised. If you've never seen this before, you will notice
that the cross derivative, <i>y</i> followed by <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>
followed by <i>y</i>, will come up being equal. That's a general
property of any reasonable function. By reasonable, I mean you cannot
call the mathematicians to help because they will always find something
where this won't work, okay? But if you write down any function that
you are capable of writing down with powers of <i>x</i> and powers of
<i>y</i> and sines and cosines, it'll always be true that you could
take the cross derivatives in either order and get the same answer. I'd
like to give a little bit of a feeling for why that is true; it's true
but it's helpful to know why it's true. So, let's ask the following
question.</p>

<p>Let's take a function and let's ask how much the function changes
when I go from some point <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> to another point <i>x</i> +
<i>Δx</i>, <i>y</i> + <i>Δy</i>. I want to find the change in the
function. So, I'm asking you what is <i>f(x + Δx, y + Δy) - f(x,y)</i>
for small values of <i>Δx</i> and <i>Δy</i>. For neighboring points,
what's the change? So, we're going to do it in two stages. We introduce
an intermediate point here, whose coordinate is <i>x + Δ x</i> and
<i>y</i>, and I'm going to add and subtract the value of the function
here. Adding and subtracting is free; it doesn't cost anything, so
let's do that. Then, what do I get? I get <i>f(x + Δx, y + Δy ) - f(x +
Δx, y) + f(x + Δx, y) - f(x,y)</i>. I'm just saying, the change of that
guy minus this guy is the same as that minus this, plus this minus
that; that's a trivial substitution. But I write it this way because I
look at the first entity here, it looks like I'm just changing
<i>y</i>. I'm not changing <i>x</i>, you agree? So what will this be?
This is going to be the rate of change of the function with respect to
<i>x</i> times <i>Δx</i>, and this--I'm sorry, I got it wrong, with
respect to <i>y</i> times <i>Δy</i>. This one is <i>df/dx</i> times
<i>Δx</i>. Therefore, the change in the function, if I add it all up, I
get <i>df/dx Δx + df/dy Δy</i>. But if you are pedantic, you will
notice there is something I have to be a little careful about. What do
you think I'm referring to, in my notation, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Meaning?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, but this is nothing to do
with dimension, you see. It's one number minus another number. I put
another number in between and in this function; it's a function only of
here. Let me see, <i>x</i> is not changing at all and <i>y</i> is
changing, so it is <i>df/dy Δy</i>. I meant something else. That is, in
fact, a good approximation but there is one thing you should be careful
about which has to do with where the derivatives are really taken. For
the term here, <i>f(x + Δx, y) - f(xy)</i>, I took the derivative, at
my starting point. If you want, I will say at the starting point
<i>xy</i>. The second one, when I came here and I want to move up, I'm
taking the derivative with respect to <i>y</i> at the new point. The
new point is <i>(x + Δx, y)</i>, so derivatives are not quite taken at
the same point. So, you've got to fix that. And how do you fix that
part? You argue that the derivative with respect to <i>y</i> is just
another function of <i>y</i>; <i>f</i> is a function of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>, its derivatives are functions of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
Everything is a function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, and we are saying
this derivative has been computed at <i>x + Δx</i>, instead of
<i>x</i>, so it is going to be <i>df/dy</i> at <i>xy</i> <i>+
d<sup>2</sup>f/dxdy</i> times <i>Δx</i>.</p>

<p>In other words, I am saying the derivative at this location is the
derivative at that location, plus the rate of change of the derivative
times the change in <i>x</i>. In other words, the derivative itself is
changing. So, if you put that together you find it is <i>df/dx Δx +
df/dy Δy</i>, where if I don't put any bars or anything it means at the
starting point <i>xy + (d<sup>2</sup>f/dxdy) Δx Δy</i>. Now, you've got
to realize that when you're doing these calculus problems, Δx is a tiny
number, Δy is a tiny number, Δx Δy is tiny times tiny. So normally, we
don't care about it, or if you want to be more accurate, of course, you
should keep that term. In the first approximation, where you work to
the first power of everything, this will be your <i>Δf</i>. But if
you're a little more ambitious but you keep track of the fact the
derivative itself is changing, you will keep that term.</p>

<p>But another person comes along and says, "You know what, I want to
go like this. I want to introduce as my new point, intermediate point,
the one here. It had a different value of <i>y</i> in the same <i>x</i>
and then I went horizontally when I keep track of the changes." What do
you think that person will calculate for the change in the function?
That person will get exactly this part, but the extra term that person
will get will look like <i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dydx</i> times <i>Δy Δx</i>.
If you just do the whole thing in your head, you can see that I'm just
exchanging the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> roles. So, everything that
happened with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> here will come backwards with
<i>y</i> and <i>x</i>. But then, the change between these two points is
the change between these two points and it doesn't matter whether I
introduce an intermediate point here or an intermediate point there;
therefore, these changes have to be equal. This part is of course
equal; therefore, you want that part to be equal, <i>Δx Δy</i> is
clearly <i>Δy Δx</i>, so the consequence of that is
<i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dxdy</i> = <i>d<sup>2</sup>f/dydx</i> and that's the
reason it turns out when you take cross derivatives you get the same
answer. It comes from the fact -- if you say, where is that result
coming from -- it comes from the fact, if you start at some point and
you go to another point and you ask for the change in the function, the
change is accumulating as you move. You can move horizontally and then
vertically, or you can move vertically and then horizontally. The
change in the function is a change in the function. You've got to get
the same answer both ways. That's the reason; that's the requirement
that leads to this requirement.</p>

<p>Now, I will not be keeping track of functions to this accuracy in
everything we do today. We'll be keeping the leading powers in
<i>Δx</i> and <i>Δy</i>. So, you should bear in mind that if you make a
movement in the <i>xy</i> plane, which is <i>Δx</i> horizontally and
<i>Δy</i> vertically, then the change in the function is this [<i>df/dx
Δx + df/dy Δy</i>]. Draw a box around that, because that's going to
be--This is just the naïve generalization to two dimensions of what you
know in one dimension. We were saying look, the function is changing
because the independent variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are changing,
and the change in the function is one part, which I blame on the
changing <i>x</i>, and a second part, which I blame on the changing
<i>y</i> and I add them. So, you're worried about the fact that we're
moving in the plane and there are vectors. That's all correct, but
<i>f</i> is not a vector, <i>f</i> is just a number and this change has
got two parts, okay. So, this is basically all the math we will need to
do, what I want to do today.</p>

<p>So, let's now go back to our original goal, which was to derive
something like the Law of Conservation of Energy in two dimensions
instead of one. You remember what I did last time so I will remind you
one more time what the trick was. We found out that the change in the
kinetic energy of some object is equal to the work done by a force,
which was some <i>F</i> times <i>Δx</i> and then if you add all the
changes over a not infinitesimal displacement, but a macroscopic
displacement, that was given by integral of <i>F</i> times <i>dx</i>
and the integral of <i>F</i> times <i>dx</i> from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>
to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. If <i>F</i> is a function only of <i>x</i>,
from the rules of calculus, the integral can be written as a difference
of a function at this limit minus that limit, and that was
<i>U(x<sub>1</sub>) - U(x<sub>2</sub>)</i>, where <i>U</i> is that
function whose derivative with a minus sign is <i>F</i>. That's what we
did. Then, it's very simple now to take the <i>U<sub>1</sub></i> to the
left-hand side. Let me see, <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> to the right-hand side
and <i>U(x<sub>2</sub>)</i> to the left-hand side, to get
<i>K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub> = K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1</sub></i>
and that's the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>You want to try the same thing in two dimensions; that's your goal.
So, the first question is, "What should I use for the work done?" What
expression should I use for the work done in two dimensions, because
the force now is a vector; force is not one number, it's got an
<i>x</i> part and a <i>y</i> part. My displacement has also got an
<i>x</i> part and a <i>y</i> part and I can worry about what I should
use. So, I'm going to deduce the quantity I want to use for <i>ΔW</i>,
namely, the tiny work done which is an extension of this. I'm going to
demand that since I'm looking for a Work Energy Theorem, I'm going to
demand that, remember in one dimension <i>ΔK = F Δx</i>. If we divide
it by the time over which it happens, I find <i>dK/dt</i> is equal to
force [F] times velocity [v].</p>

<p>I'm going to demand that that's the power, force times velocity, is
what I call the power. And I'm going to look for <i>dK/dt</i> in two
dimensions, of a body that's moving. What's the rate at which kinetic
energy is changing when a body is moving? For that, I need a formula
for kinetic energy. A formula for kinetic energy is going to be again ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. I want that to be the same entity, so I will
choose it to be that, but <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> has got now
<i>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></i> <i>+ v<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup></i>,
because you know whenever you take a vector <i>V</i>, then its length
is the square root of the <i>x</i> part squared plus the <i>y</i> part
squared. Any questions? Okay, so let's take the rate of change of this,
<i>dK/dt</i>. Again, you have to know your calculus. What's the time
derivative of <i>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></i>? The rule from calculus
says, first take the derivative of <i>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></i>
with respect to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, which is 2<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,
then take the derivative of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> with respect to time.
So, you do the same thing for the second term, 2 <i>v<sub>y</sub>
dv<sub>y</sub>/dt</i>, and that gives me--the 2s cancel, gives me
<i>mdv<sub>x</sub> /dtv<sub>x</sub> + m dv<sub>y</sub>
/dtv<sub>y</sub></i>. This is the rate at which the kinetic energy of a
body is changing. So, what's my next step, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> So what happened to the half?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> The half got canceled by the two
here. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> That's correct. So, what we want
to do is to recognize this as <i>ma</i> in the <i>x</i> direction,
because <i>m</i> times <i>dv<sub>x</sub>/dt</i> is
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, and this is <i>m</i> times <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>.
Therefore, they are the forces in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions,
so I write <i>F<sub>x</sub>v<sub>x</sub> +
F<sub>y</sub>v<sub>y</sub></i>. So the power, when you go to two
dimensions, is not very different from one dimension. In one dimension,
you had only one force and you had only one velocity. In two
dimensions, you got an <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> component for each one,
and it becomes this. So, this is what I will define to be the power.
When a body is moving and a force is acting on it, the force has two
components, the velocity has two components; this combination shall be
called "Power." But now, let's multiply both sides by <i>Δt</i> and
write the change in kinetic energy is equal to <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and
you guys think about what happens when I multiply <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>
by <i>Δt</i>; <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>dx/dt</i>. Multiplying by
<i>Δt</i> just gives me the distance traveled in the <i>x</i> direction
<i>+ F<sub>y</sub></i> times <i>dy</i>. So, this is the tiny amount of
work done by a force and it generalizes what we had here, work done is
force times <i>Δx</i>. In two dimensions, it's <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx +
F<sub>y</sub>dy</i>. It's not hard to guess that but the beauty
is--this combination--Now you can say, you know what, I didn't have to
do all this, I could have always guessed that in two dimensions, when
you had an <i>x</i> and a <i>y</i> you obviously have to add them.
There's nothing very obvious about it because this combination is now
guaranteed to have the property that if I call this the work done.
Then, it has the advantage that the work done is in fact the change in
kinetic energy.</p>

<p>I want to define work so that its effect on kinetic energy is the
same as in 1D, namely, work done should be equal to change in kinetic
energy. And I engineered that by taking the change in kinetic energy,
seeing whatever it came out to, and calling that the work done, I
cannot go wrong. But now, if you notice something repeating itself all
the time, which is that I had a vector <i>F</i>, which you can write as
<i>I</i> times <i>F<sub>x</sub> + J</i> times <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>, I
had a vector velocity, which is <i>I</i> times <i>v<sub>x</sub> + J</i>
times <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>. Then, I had a tiny distance moved by the
particle, which is <i>I</i> times <i>dx + J</i> times <i>dy</i>. So,
the particle moves from one point to another point. The vector
describing its location changes by this tiny vector. It's just the step
in the <i>x</i> direction times <i>I</i>, plus step in the <i>y</i>
direction times <i>J</i>. So, what you're finding is the following
combination. The <i>x</i> component of <i>F</i> times the <i>x</i>
component of <i>v</i>, plus the <i>y</i> component of <i>F</i>, times
the <i>y</i> component of <i>v</i>. Or <i>F</i> component of <i>x</i>
times the distance moved in <i>x</i> plus <i>y</i> component of
<i>F</i> times the displacement in <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>So, we are running into the following combination. We are saying,
there seem to be in all these problems two vectors, <i>I</i> times
<i>A<sub>x</sub> + J</i> times <i>A<sub>y</sub></i>. <i>A</i>, for
example, could be the force that I'm talking about. There's another
vector <i>B</i>, which is <i>I</i> times <i>B<sub>x</sub> + J</i> times
<i>B<sub>y</sub></i>. Right? For example, this guy could be standing in
for <i>F</i>, this could be standing in for <i>v</i>. The combination
that seems to appear very naturally is the combination
<i>A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>y</sub></i>. It
appears too many times so I take it seriously, give that a name. That
name will be called a dot product of <i>A</i> with <i>B</i> and is
written like this. Whenever something appears all the time you give it
a name; this is <i>A.B.</i> So, for any two vectors <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, that will be the definition of <i>A.B</i>. Then, the work
done by a force <i>F</i>, that displaces a particle by a tiny vector
<i>dr</i>, is <i>F.dr</i>. The particle's moving in the <i>xy</i>
plane. From one instant to the next, it can move from here to there.
That little guy is <i>dr</i>; it's got a little bit horizontal and it's
got a little bit vertical, that's how you build <i>dr</i>. The force
itself is some force which at that point need not point at the
direction in which you're moving. It's some direction. At each point,
the force could have whatever value it likes.</p>

<p>So, the dot product, you know, sometimes you learn the dot product
as <i>A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>y</sub></i>, you
can ask, "Who thought about it?" Why is it a natural quantity? And here
is one way you can understand why somebody would think of this
particular combination.</p>

<p>So, once you've got the dot product, you've got to get a feeling for
what it is. The first thing we realize is that if you take a dot
product of <i>A</i> with itself, then it's
<i>A<sub>x</sub>A<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>A<sub>y</sub></i>, which
is <i>A<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> + A<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, which
is the length of the vector <i>A</i>, which you can either denote this
way or just write it without an arrow. So <i>A.A</i> is a positive
number that measures the length squared of the vector <i>A</i>,
likewise <i>B.B</i>. Now, we have to ask ourselves, "What is
<i>A.B</i>?" So, somebody know what <i>A.B</i> is? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, so how do we know that?
How do we know it's length of <i>A</i> times length of <i>B</i> times
cosine of the angle? You should follow from--Is it an independent
definition or is it a consequence of this? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, you can derive using the Law of Cosines.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. He said we can derive it
using the Law of Cosines and that's what I will do now. In other words,
that definition which you may have learnt about first is not
independent of this definition; it's a consequence of this definition.
So, let's see why that's true. Let's draw two vectors here. Here is
<i>A</i> and here is <i>B</i>, it's got a length <i>A</i>, it's got a
length <i>B</i>, this makes an angle, <i>θ<sub>A</sub></i> with the
<i>x</i> axis, and that makes an angle <i>θ<sub>B</sub></i> for the
<i>x</i> axis. Now, do you guys agree that the <i>x</i> component of
<i>A</i> with the horizontal part of <i>A</i> is the <i>A</i> <i>cos
θ<sub>A</sub></i>? You must've seen a lot of examples of that when you
did all the force calculation. And <i>A<sub>y</sub></i> is equal to the
length of <i>A</i> times <i>sin θ<sub>A</sub></i> and likewise for
<i>B</i>; I don't feel like writing it. If you do that, then <i>A.B</i>
will be length of <i>A</i>, length of <i>B</i> times <i>(cos
θ<sub>A</sub> cos θ<sub>B</sub> + sin θ<sub>A</sub> sin
θ<sub>B</sub>)</i>.</p>

<p>You've got to go back to your good old trig and it'll tell you this
<i>cos cos</i> plus <i>sin sin is cos (θ<sub>A</sub> –
θ<sub>B</sub>)</i>.So, you find it is length of <i>A</i>, length of
<i>B</i>, <i>cos (θ<sub>A</sub> – θ<sub>B</sub>)</i>. Often, people
simply say that is <i>AB cos θ</i>, where it's understood that <i>θ</i>
is the angle between the two vectors. So, the dot product that you
learnt--I don't know which way it was introduced to you first, but
these are two equivalent definitions of the dot product. In one of
them, if you're thinking more in terms of the components of <i>A</i>, a
pair of numbers for <i>A</i> and a pair of numbers for <i>B</i>, this
definition of the dot product is very nice. If you're thinking of them
as two little arrows pointing in different directions, then the other
definition, in which the lengths and the angle between them appear,
that's more natural. But numerically they're equal. An important
property of the dot product, which you can check either way, is the dot
product of <i>A</i> with <i>B + C</i>, is dot product of <i>A</i> with
<i>B</i> plus dot product of <i>A</i> with <i>C</i>. That just means
you can open all the brackets with dot products as you can with
ordinary products. Now, that's a very important property of the dot
product. So, maybe I can ask somebody, do you know one property,
significant property of the dot product?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> When two vectors are perpendicular the dot product
equals 0.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh that's interesting, I didn't
think about it. Yes. One thing is if two vectors are perpendicular the
dot product is 0 because the cosine of 90 is 0. But what I had in
mind--Of course it's hard for me, it's not fair I ask you some question
without saying what I'm looking for. What can you say if you use a
different set of axis? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> In this case it doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> If you go to the rotated axis,
the components of vector <i>A</i> will change. We have done that in the
homework; we've done that in the class. The components of <i>B</i> will
also change. Everything will get a prime. But the combination,
<i>A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub> + A<sub>y</sub>B<sub>y</sub></i>, when
you evaluate it before or after, will give the same answer because it's
not so obvious when you write it this way. But it's very obvious when
you write it this way because it's clear to us if you stand on your
head or you rotate the whole axis. What you're looking for is the
length of <i>A</i>, which certainly doesn't change on your orientation,
or the length of <i>B</i>, or the angle between them. The angle
<i>θ<sub>A</sub></i> will change but the angle with the new <i>x</i>
axis won't be the same. The angle with the new <i>y</i> axis won't be
the same. Likewise for <i>B</i>, but the angle between the vectors,
it's an invariant property, something intrinsic to the two vectors,
doesn't change, so the dot product is an invariant. This is a very
important notion. When you learn relativity, you will find you have one
observer saying something, another observer saying something. They will
disagree on a lot of things, but there are few things they will all
agree on. Those few things will be analog of <i>A.B</i>. So, it's very
good to have this part of it very clear in your head. This part of
elementary vector analysis should be clear in your head.</p>

<p>Okay, so any questions about this? So, if you want, geometrically,
the work done by a force when it moves a body a distance <i>dr</i>, a
vector <i>dr</i>, is the length of the force, the distance traveled,
times the cosine of the angle between the force and the displacement
vector.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm almost ready for business because, what is my goal? I find
out that in a tiny displacement, <i>F.dr</i>, I start from somewhere, I
go to a neighboring place, a distance <i>dr</i> away. The change in
kinetic energy is <i>F.dr</i>. So, let me make a big trip, okay, let me
make a trip in the <i>xy</i> plane made up of a whole bunch of little
segments in each one of which I calculate this, and I add them all up.
On the left-hand side, the <i>ΔK</i>s, this whole thing was defined so
that it's equal to <i>ΔK</i>, right? <i>ΔK</i> was equal to this,
that's equal to all that. So, if you add all the <i>ΔK</i>s, it's very
clear what you will get. You will get the kinetic energy at the end
minus kinetic energy at the beginning. On the right-hand side, you are
told to add <i>F.dr</i> for every tiny segment. Well, that is written
symbolically as this. This is the notation we use in calculus. That
just means, if you want to go from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> along some
path, you chop up the path into tiny pieces. Each tiny segment, if it's
small enough to be approximated by a tiny vector <i>dr</i>, then take
the dot product of that little <i>dr</i>, with the force at that point,
which means length of <i>F</i>, times the length of the segment, times
cosine of the angle; add them all up. Then somebody will say, "Well,
your segments are not short enough for me." We'll chop it up some more,
then chop it up some more, chop it up till your worst critic has been
silenced. That's the limit in which you can write the answer as this
integral. Just like in calculus when you integrate a function you take
tiny intervals <i>Δx</i>, multiply <i>F</i> by <i>Δx</i>, but then you
make the intervals more and more numerous but less and less wide and
the limit of that is the area under the graph and that's called
"integral," you do the same thing now in two dimensions.</p>

<p>So, now maybe it'll be true, just like in one dimension, the
integral of this function will be something that depends on the end
points. I'm just going to call it <i>U(1) - U(2)</i>, of some function
<i>U</i>, just like it was in one dimension. If that is true, then my
job is done because then I have <i>K<sub>1</sub> + U<sub>1</sub> =
K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub></i>. So, when I'm looking for the Law of
Conservation of Energy, I've got to go to some calculus book and I got
to ask the calculus book, "Look, in one dimension you told me integral
of <i>F</i> from start to end is really the difference of another
function <i>G</i> of the end minus the start, with <i>G</i> as that
function whose derivative is <i>F</i>." Maybe there is going to be some
other magic function you knew in two dimensions related to <i>F</i>, in
some way, so that this integral is again given by a difference of
something there minus something here. If that is the case, then you can
rearrange it and get this. But you will find that it's not meant to be
that simple. So, again, has anybody heard rumors about why it may not
be that simple? What could go wrong? Okay so, yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, that's probably correct
but say it in terms of what we know. What can go wrong? I'm saying in
one end, I did an integral; the integral was the difference of two
numbers and therefore I got <i>K + U = K + U</i>. So, something could
go wrong somewhere here when I say this integral from start to finish
is the difference only of the ending point minus the starting point. Is
that reasonable or could you imagine it depending on something else?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, say you have one of your forces is friction.
If you take a certain path from point one to point two, you should have
the same thing in potential energy. But if you take a longer path and
there's friction involved, your kinetic energy would be reduced.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Absolutely correct. It is
certainly true that if you've got friction, this is not going to work.
It doesn't even work in 1D. In 1D, if I start here and end here, and I
worry about friction, if it went straight from here to here there's
amount of friction. If I just went back and forth 97 times and then I
ended up there is 97 times more friction. So, we agreed that if there's
friction, this is not going to work. But the trouble with friction was,
the force was not a function only of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. It depended
on the direction of motion. But now, I grant you that the force is not
a function of velocity. It's only a function of where you are. Can
something still be wrong?</p>

<p>Well, let me ask you the following question. Another person does
this. [Shows a different path from 1 to 2] Do you think that person
should do the same amount of work because the force is now integrated
on a longer path? So, you see, in one dimension there's only one way to
go from here to there. Just go, right? That way, when you write an
integral you write the lower limit and the upper limit and you don't
say any more because it's only one way in 1D to go from
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. In two dimensions, there
are thousands of ways to go from one point to another point. You can
wander all over the place and you end up here. Therefore, this
integral, even if I say the starting point is <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and
the ending point is <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>, that this is
<i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and that's <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>, it's not
adequate. What do you think I should attach to this integration? What
other information should I give? What more should I specify? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Along a closed path.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, it's not a closed path. I'm
going from 1 to 2. What more should I tell you before you can even find
the work done? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What path you're going on.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You have to say which path
you're going on because if you only have two points, 1 and 2, then
there is a work done but it depends on the path. If the work depends on
the path, then the answer cannot be a function of <i>U(1) - U(2)</i>,
cannot just be <i>U(1) - U(2)</i>. <i>U(1) - U(2)</i> says, tell me
what you entered, tell me where you start, and that difference of some
function <i>U</i> between those two points is the work done. In other
words, I'm asking you to think critically about whether this equality
really could be true. This is some function <i>U</i> in the <i>xy</i>
plane evaluated at one point minus the other point. This is on a path
joining those two points but I have not told you which path and I can
draw any path I like with those same end points. And you got to realize
that it's very unreasonable to expect that. No matter which path you
take you will get the same answer. Okay, so you might think that I'm
creating a straw man because it's going to turn out by some magic, that
no matter what force you take somehow, due to the magic of mathematics,
the integral will depend only on the end points. But that's not the
case. In general, that won't happen. So, I have to show you that. So,
I'm going to start by asking you, give me a number from 1 to 3. 2?
Okay, 2. Then, I want a few more numbers, another number from 1 to
3.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> From 1 to 3, [audience laughs].
All right then, two more. Mark, you pick a number.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Good, thank you. Then I need one
more, yes? 1 to 3, a number from 1 to 3.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> 2, very good. Okay, so you pick
these numbers randomly, and I'm going to take a force which looks like
<i>I</i> times <i>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> + J</i> times
<i>xy<sup>2</sup></i>, okay? I put the powers based on what you guys
gave me. So, we picked the force in two dimensions out of the hat. Now,
let's ask, "Is it true for this force that the work done in going from
one point to another depends only on the path, or does it depend, I
mean, it depends only on the end points or does it depend in detail on
how you go from the end points?" You all have to understand, before you
copy anything down, where we are going with this. What's the game plan?
So, let me tell you one more time because you can copy this all you
want, it will get you nowhere. You should feel that you know where I'm
going but the details remain to be shown or you should have an idea
what's happening. If you try to generalize the Work Energy Theorem to
two dimensions, this is what happened so far. You found a definition of
work which has the property that the work done is the change in kinetic
energy. Then, you added up all the changes of kinetic energy and added
up all the work done and you said <i>K<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub></i>
is the integral of <i>F.dr</i>; that's guaranteed to be true; that's
just based on Newton's laws.</p>

<p>What is tricky is the second equality that that integral is the
difference in a function calculated at one end point minus the other
end point. If that was true, if the integral depended only on the end
points, then it cannot depend on the path that you take. If it depends
on the path, every path you take within the same two end points will
give different numbers. So, the answer cannot simply be
<i>U<sub>1</sub> - U<sub>2</sub></i>. First, I'm trying to convince
you, through an example that I selected randomly, that if you took a
random force and found the work done along one path, or another path,
you will in fact get two different answers, okay? That's the first
thing, to appreciate that there's a problem. So generally, if we took a
random force, not a frictional force, a force that depends only on
location and not velocity, it will not be possible to define a
potential energy nor will it be possible to define a <i>K + U</i> so
that it doesn't change. So, it's going to take a very special force for
which the answer depends only on the starting and ending point and not
on the path. To show you that that's a special situation, I'm taking a
generic situation, namely, a force manufactured by this class, without
any prior consultation with me, and I will show you that for that force
the answer is going to depend on how you go.</p>

<p>So, let's take that force and let's find the work done in going from
the origin to the point 1,1. So, I'm going to take two paths. One path
I'm going to go horizontally till I'm below the point. Then I'm going
straight up, okay. So, let's find the work done when I go this way. So
again, you should be thinking all the time. You should say if this guy
got struck by lightning can I do anything, or am I just going to say
"Well, I don't know what he was planning to do." You've got to have
some idea what I'm going to do. I'm going to integrate <i>F.dr</i>,
first on the horizontal segment, then on the vertical segment. <i>F</i>
is some vector you give me at the point <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>; I'll
plug in some numbers, I'll get something times <i>I</i> and something
times <i>J</i>. It may be pointing like that at this point, and that's
<i>F</i>, that's given. Now, when I'm moving horizontally my
displacement <i>dr</i>, has only got a <i>dx</i> part. I hope you see
that. Every step I move, there's no <i>dy</i> in it, it's all
horizontal. So, <i>F.dr</i> just becomes <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx</i> because
there is no <i>dy</i> when you move horizontally. So, when you do the
integral, you have <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx</i>. <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> happens
to be <i>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>dx</i>, <i>x</i> going from 0 to 1.
Now, what do I do with <i>y<sup>3</sup></i>? You all know how to
integrate a function of <i>x</i> times <i>dx</i>. What do I do with
<i>y<sup>3</sup></i>? What do you think it means?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me? What should I do with
<i>y</i>? Evaluate <i>y</i> on that path at that point. Well, it turns
out, throughout this horizontal segment <i>y</i> = 0, so this is gone.
Basically, the point is very simple. When you move horizontally, you're
working against horizontal forces doing work, but on the <i>x</i> axis
when <i>y</i> is 0 there is no horizontal force; that's why there's
nothing to do. Now, you come to this segment. I think you all agree,
the distance traveled is <i>J</i> times <i>dy</i>. So, I have to have
another segment, the second part of my trip, which is
<i>F<sub>y</sub></i> times <i>dy</i>, and <i>y</i> goes from 0 to 1,
and the <i>y</i> component is <i>xy<sup>2</sup>dy</i>, where <i>y</i>
goes from 0 to 1. But now, on the entire line that I'm moving up and
down, <i>x</i> = 1. Do you see that? <i>x</i> is a constant on the line
so you can replace <i>x</i> by 1 and integral of <i>y<sup>2</sup>dy</i>
is <i>y<sup>3</sup></i> over 3.The work done is, therefore, 1/3 joules.
So, the work done in going first to the right and then to the top is
1/3. You can also go straight up and then horizontally. By a similar
trick, I won't do that now, because I want to show you something else
that's useful for you, I'm going to pick another path which is not just
made up of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> segments. Then it's very easy to do
this.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to pick another way to go from 0,0 to 1,1, which is on
this curve; this is the curve <i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i>. First of all,
you've got to understand the curve <i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i> goes
through the two points I'm interested in. If you took <i>y</i> =
5<i>x<sup>2</sup></i>, it doesn't work. But this guy goes through 0,0
and goes through 1,1. And I'm asking you, if I did the work done by the
force along that segment, what is the integral of <i>F.dr</i>? So,
let's take a tiny portion of that, looks like this, right, that's
<i>dr</i>, it's got a <i>dx</i>, and it's got a <i>dy</i>. Now, you
notice that as this segment becomes very small <i>dy/dx</i> is a slope;
therefore, <i>dy</i> will be <i>dy/dx</i> times <i>dx</i>. In other
words, <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> are not independent if they're moving in
a particular direction. I hope you understand that. You want to follow
a certain curve. If you step to the right by some amount, you've got to
step vertically by a certain amount so you're moving on that curve.
That's why, when you calculate the work done, <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i>
are not independent. So, what you really want is <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx +
F<sub>y</sub>dy</i>, but for <i>dy</i> I'm going to use <i>dy/dx</i>
times <i>dx</i>. In other words, every segment <i>Δy</i> that you have
is related to the <i>Δx</i> you took horizontally so that you stay on
that curve. So, everything depends only on <i>dx</i>. But what am I
putting inside the integral? Let's take <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>, the
<i>x</i> component is <i>x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup></i>. On this curve
<i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i>, so you really write <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>, and
<i>y = x<sup>2</sup></i>, that is <i>x<sup>6</sup></i>. This
<i>x<sup>3</sup></i> [should have said x<sup>6</sup>] is really
<i>y<sup>3</sup></i> written in terms of <i>x</i>. Then, I have to
write <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>, which is <i>x</i> times
<i>y<sup>2</sup></i>, which is <i>x<sup>4</sup></i> times <i>dy/dx</i>
which is 2<i>x</i>. So, I get here, from all of this, <i>(x<sup>8</sup>
+ 2x<sup>5</sup>)dx</i>. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Pardon me?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The second part of this.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Did I, here? Here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, <i>x<sup>6</sup></i>, right,
thank you. How is that? Thanks for watching that; you have to watch it.
So, now what do I get? <i>x<sup>8</sup></i> integral is
<i>x<sup>9</sup></i>/9. That gives me 1, 9 because x is going from 0 to
1. The next thing is <i>x<sup>7</sup></i>/7, which is 2 times that.
Well, I'm not paying too much attention to this because I know it's not
1/3, okay? There's no way this guy's going to be 1/3, that's all I care
about. So, I've shown you that if we took a random force, the work done
is dependent on the path. For this force, you cannot define a potential
energy whereas in one dimension any force that was not friction allowed
you to define a potential energy. In higher dimensions, you just cannot
do that; that's the main point. So, if you're looking for a
conservative, this is called a "conservative force." It's a force for
which you can define a potential energy. It has the property of the
work done in going from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, or 1 to 2, is independent
of how you got from 1 to 2. And the one force that the class generated
pretty much randomly is not a conservative force because the work done
was path dependent.</p>

<p>So, what we have learned, in fact I'll keep this portion here, if
you're looking for a conservative force, a force whose answer does not
depend on how you went from start to finish, then you have to somehow
dream up some force so that if you did this integral the answer does
not depend on the path. You realize, that looks really miraculous
because we just wrote down an arbitrary force that we all cooked up
together with these exponents, and the answer depends on the path. And
I guarantee you, if you just arbitrarily write down some force, it
won't work. So, maybe there is no Law of Conservation of Energy in more
than one dimension. So, how am I going to search for a force that will
do the job? Are there at least some forces for which this will be true?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The force is always parallel to the path along which
you have [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, but see the point is you've
got to first write down a force in the <i>xy</i> plane. Then, I should
be free to pick any two points and connect them any way I like and the
answer shouldn't depend on how we connected them. Only then, you can
have conservation of energy. I hope you all understand that fact. So,
I'm saying, a generic force on the <i>xy</i> plane doesn't do that.
Then we ask, "Can there ever be an answer?" It is so demanding.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, in the inverse square force they've got
it.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, so he's saying, "I know a
force." The force of gravity, in fact, happens to have the property
that the work done by the force of gravity does not depend on the path.
We will see why that is true. But you see, what I want is to ask, "Is
there a machine that'll manufacture conservative forces?" and I'm going
to tell you there is. I will show you a machine that'll produce a large
number, an infinite number of conservative forces, and I'll show you
how to produce that. Here is the trick. The trick is, instead of taking
a force and finding if there's a potential that will come from it by
doing integrals, let me assume there is a potential. Then, I will ask
what force I can associate with the potential, and here is the answer.
The answer is, step one, pick any <i>U</i> of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
You pick the function first. That function is going to be your
potential energy; it's been anointed even before we do anything. But
then, from the potential, I want you to manufacture the following
force. I want the force that I'm going to find to have an <i>x</i>
component, which is [minus] the derivative of <i>U</i> with respect to
<i>x</i>, and is going to have a <i>y</i> component which is [minus]
the derivative of <i>U</i> with respect to <i>y</i>. That is step two.
In fact, the claim now is this force is going to be a conservative
force. And in fact, this potential energy associated with it will be
the function you started with. So, how do I know that?</p>

<p>So, for example, I'm saying suppose <i>U = xy<sup>3</sup></i>, then
<i>F<sub>x</sub> = -dU/dx</i>, which is equal to <i>-y<sup>3</sup></i>,
and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>, which is <i>-dU/dy</i> would be
<i>-</i>3<i>xy<sup>2</sup></i>. The claim is, if you put <i>I</i> times
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>J</i> times <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>, the
answer will not depend on how you go from start to finish. So, let me
prove that to you. Here is the proof. The change in the function
<i>U</i>, in the <i>xy</i> plane, you guys remember me telling you, is
<i>dU/dx</i> times <i>dx + dU/dy</i> times <i>dy</i>. That's the whole
thing of mathematical preliminaries which was done somewhere, I forgot,
here. It says, here, <i>ΔF</i> is <i>dF/dx</i> times <i>Δx + dF/dy</i>
times <i>Δy</i>. I'll apply that to the function <i>U</i>, but who is
this? You notice what's going on here? <i>dU/dx</i> times <i>dx</i>,
this is <i>F<sub>x</sub>,</i> with a minus sign, that's
<i>F<sub>y</sub></i> with the minus sign. Therefore this is equal to
<i>-F.dr</i>. Right? Because we agree, the force that I want to
manufacture is related to <i>U</i> in this fashion. Now, if you add all
the changes, the right-hand side becomes the integral of <i>F.dr</i>,
and the left-hand side becomes the sum of all the <i>ΔU</i>s with a
minus sign. Add all the <i>ΔU</i>s with a minus sign, that'll just
become <i>U</i> at 1 <i>-U</i> at 2. It is cooked up so that
<i>F.dr</i> is actually at the change in the function <i>U</i>. That's
if you say, what was the trick that you did? I cooked up a force by
design so that <i>F.dr</i> was a change in a certain function <i>U</i>.
If I add all the <i>F.dr</i>s, I'm going to get a change in the
function <i>U</i> from start to finish and it's got to be
<i>U<sub>1</sub> - U<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>So, I don't know how else I can say this. Maybe the way to think
about it is, why do certain integrals not depend on how you took the
path, right? Let me ask you a different question; forget about
integrals. You are on top of some hilly mountain. We have a starting
point, you have an ending point, okay. I started the starting point,
and I walked to the ending point. At every portion of my walk, I keep
track of how many feet I'm climbing; that's like my <i>ΔU</i>. I add
them all up. At the end of the day, the height change will be the top
of the mountain minus bottom of the mountain, the height of the
mountain. You go on a different path, you don't go straight for the
summit, you loop around and you coil and you wind down, you go up, you
do this, and you also end up at the summit. If you kept track of how
long you walked, it won't be the same as me. But if you also kept track
of how many feet you climbed and you added them all up, what answer
will you get? You'll get the same answer I got. Therefore, if what you
were keeping track of was the height change in a function, then the sum
of all the height changes will be simply the total height change, which
is the height at the end minus height at the beginning. Therefore,
starting with the height function, by taking its derivatives, if you
manufacture a force, this will be none other than the fact of adding up
the changes. And that's why this will be <i>K<sub>2</sub> -
K<sub>1</sub></i>, and then you will get <i>K<sub>1</sub> +
U<sub>1</sub> = K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub></i>. I hope you
understand how conservative forces are not impossible to get. In fact,
for every function <i>U</i> of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> you can think of,
you can manufacture a conservative force.</p>

<p>So, you may ask the following question. Maybe there are other ways
to manufacture the conservative force and you just thought of one, and
the answer is "no." Not only is this a machine that generates
conservative forces, my two step algorithm, pick a <i>U</i> and take
its derivatives, every conservative force you get is necessarily
obtained by taking derivatives with respect to <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> of
some function <i>U</i> and that <i>U</i> will be the potential energy
associated with that force. So, when that force alone acts on a body
the kinetic plus that potential will not change.</p>

<p>Finally, you remember that when the class picked a certain force,
which I wrote here, I went on a limb and I said I'm going to do the
integral of this force along this path and that path and I'm going to
get different answers and show you we have a problem. What if the force
you had given me was actually a conservative force? Then, I would be
embarrassed because then I'll find, after all the work, this'll turn
out to be again 1/3. So, I have to make sure right away that the force
is not conservative. How can you tell? One way to say it is, ask
yourself, "Could that be some function <i>U</i> whose <i>x</i>
derivative of this was this, and whose <i>y</i> derivative was that?"
You can probably convince yourself no function is going to do it for
you because if you took an <i>x</i> derivative you should've lost a
power of <i>x</i> here. That means, if you just took the <i>y</i>
derivative to go here, you should have more powers of <i>x</i> and less
powers of <i>y</i> but this is just the opposite way. So, we know this
couldn't have come from a <i>U</i>. But there's a better test. Instead
of doing all that, instead of saying I'm satisfied that this doesn't
come from taking derivatives of the <i>U</i> by looking at possible
<i>U</i>s are not being satisfied because maybe I'm not clever enough.
There is a mechanical way to tell. The mechanical way to tell is the
following. Maybe I want you guys to think for a second about what the
recipe may be. If a force came from a function <i>U</i> by taking
derivatives, as written up there, what can you say about the components
of that force, from the fact--yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What is the cross derivative [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right, we know that for every
function <i>U</i> the cross derivatives are equal but the ordinary
derivatives are just the <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>;
therefore, <i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i> over <i>dydx</i> is really <i>d</i> by
<i>dy</i> of <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>. And I want that to be equal to
<i>d</i> by <i>dx</i> of <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> because that would then
be <i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i> over <i>dxdy</i>. In other words, if the force
satisfies this condition, the <i>y</i> derivative of
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i> is the <i>x</i> derivative <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>.
Then, it has the right pedigree to be a conservative force because if a
force came from a function <i>U</i> by taking derivatives, the simple
requirement of the cross derivatives are equal for any function
<i>U</i> tells me. See, if I take the <i>y</i> derivative of
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i>, I'm taking <i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i> over
<i>dxdy</i>. And here, I'm taking <i>d<sup>2</sup>U</i> over
<i>dydx</i> and they must be equal. So, that's the diagnostic. If I
give you a force and I ask you, "Is it conservative?" you simply take
the <i>y</i> derivative of <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and the <i>x</i>
derivative of <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> and if they match you know it's
conservative.</p>

<p>So, I can summarize by saying the following thing. In two
dimensions, there are indeed many, many forces for which the potential
energy can be defined. But every one of them has an ancestor which is
simply a function, not a vector, but a scalar function, an ordinary
function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. Then, the force is obtained by
taking <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> derivatives of that function; the <i>x</i>
derivative with a minus sign is called <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>, and the
<i>y</i> derivative is called <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Okay, so let's take the most popular example is the force of gravity
near the surface of the Earth. The force of gravity we know is
<i>-mg</i> times <i>J</i>. Is this guy conservative? Yes, because the
<i>x</i> derivative of this vanishes and the <i>y</i> derivative of
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i> you don't even have to worry because there is no
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i>; it's clearly conservative. Then you can ask,
"What is the potential <i>U</i> that led to this?" Well, <i>dU/dy</i>
with a minus sign had to be <i>-mg</i> and <i>dU/dx</i> had to be 0.
So, the function that will do the job is <i>mgy</i>. You can also have
<i>mgy</i> + 96 but we will not add those constants because in the end,
in the Law of Conservation of Energy, <i>K<sub>1</sub> +U<sub>1</sub> =
K<sub>2</sub> + U<sub>2</sub></i>, adding a 96 to both sides doesn't do
anything. So this means, when a body's moving in the gravitational
field ½ <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>mgy</i>, before, is the same as ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup> + mgy</i>, after. Now, you knew this already when
you're moving up and down the <i>y</i> direction but what I'm telling
you is this is true in two dimensions.</p>

<p>So, I'll give you a final example so you guys can go home and think
about it.</p>

<p>That is a roller coaster. So, here's the roller coaster, it has a
track that looks like this. This is <i>x</i>, this is the height of the
roller coaster, but at every <i>x</i> there's a certain height so
<i>y</i> is the function of <i>x</i> and it looks like this. It's just
the profile of the roller coaster. But that is also the potential
energy <i>U</i>, because if you multiply this by <i>mg</i>, well, you
just scale the graph by <i>mg</i> it looks the same. So, take a
photograph of a roller coaster, multiply the height in meters by
<i>mg</i>, it's going to still look like the roller coaster. That is my
potential energy for this problem and the claim is that kinetic plus
potential will not change, so <i>K + U</i> is a constant; let's call
the constant <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>So, if a trolley begins here at the top, what is its total energy?
It's got potential energy equal to the height, it's got no kinetic
energy, so total energy in fact is just its height. And total energy
cannot change as the trolley goes up and down. So, you draw a line at
that height and call it the total energy. You started this guy off at
that energy, that energy must always be the same. What that means is,
if you are somewhere here, so that is your potential energy, that is
your kinetic energy, it's very nicely read off from this graph, to
reach the same total. So, as you oscillate up and down, you gain and
lose kinetic and potential. When you come here your potential energy is
almost your whole energy but you've got a little bit of kinetic energy.
That means, your roller coaster is still moving when it comes here with
the remaining kinetic energy. You can have a roller coaster whose
energy is like this. This is released from rest here. It is released
from rest here. That's the total energy and this total energy line
looks like this. That means, if you released it here, it'll come down,
pick up speed, slow down, pick up speed again, and come to this point,
it must stop and turn around because at that point the potential energy
is equal to total energy and there is no kinetic energy. That means
you've stopped, that means you're turning around, it'll rattle back and
forth. By the way, according to laws of quantum mechanics, it can do
something else. Maybe you guys know. You know what else it can do if it
starts here? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It can tunnel.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It can suddenly find itself here
and that's not allowed by classical mechanics because to do that it has
to go over the hump. Look what's happening at the hump. I've got more
kinetic energy than I have total energy. I'm sorry, I've got more
potential energy than I have total energy. That means kinetic energy is
negative, that's not possible, because ½ <i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> can
never be negative. So, quantum theory allows these forbidden processes
and it's called tunneling. But for us, the roller coaster problem, you
will just turn around. There's one thing I want you to think about
before you go. You should not have simply accepted the Law of
Conservation of Energy in this problem because gravity is not the only
force acting on this. What else is acting on this roller coaster?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> No friction.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me? No friction, then
what?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The normal force.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> The force of that track. Look,
if I didn't want to have anything but gravity, here's a roller coaster
ride you guys will love, just push you over the edge. That conserves
energy and it's got no track and it's got the only gravitational force
and you can happily use this formula. Why am I paying all this money?
Because there's another force acting on it, but that force, if it's not
frictional, is necessarily perpendicular to the motion of the trolley,
and the displacement of the trolley is along the track, so <i>F.dr</i>
vanishes. So, I will conclude by telling you the correct thing to do
would be to say <i>K<sub>2</sub> - K<sub>1</sub></i> is the integral of
all the forces, divided into force due to the track and the force due
to gravity. The force due to the track is 0. I mean, it's not 0, but
that dot product with <i>dr</i> would be 0, because <i>F</i> and
<i>dr</i> are perpendicular. For that reason, you'd drop that and the
force of gravity is cooked up so then it becomes <i>U<sub>1</sub> -
U<sub>2</sub></i> and that's what we used.</p>

<p>Okay, one challenge you guys can go home and do this, take any force
in two dimensions, <i>F</i>; it is parallel to the direction where you
are measured from the origin times any function of the distance from
the origin. Show, convince yourself that this force is a conservative
force by applying the test I gave you and the trick is to use <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> instead of <i>r</i>. Take this force, write it now in
terms of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, take the cross derivatives and you can
see it's conservative. So, any radial force, yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, here. This is the force to
which you should try your thing and gravity is a special example of
this. Okay, judging from the class reaction, and the stunned and
shocked look, a lot of you people, maybe this material is new, so you
should think about it, talk about it, go to discussion section, but
this is the level at which you should understand energy conservation in
a course like this.</p>
