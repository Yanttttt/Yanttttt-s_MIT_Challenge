<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> I thought I would go back a little bit to LCR circuits. I think that's one of
the more useful things you learn in this course. I want to do it carefully so
everyone's on top of that. So remember that the problem you want to solve
looks like this. That's an AC source. That is a resistor. There's an inductor
and a capacitor. And that's the circuit. And this voltage we take to be <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
That's the kind of voltage that will come out of any AC generator. The omega
is controlled by how the turbine is spinning. That frequency is the same as
this frequency. Our job is to find the current in the circuit. Now what makes
it difficult is that, unlike DC circuits where you take a voltage and divide by
some effective resistance, the equations here are not algebraic equations but
differential equations. So we'll write it down then I'll tell you how we
handle it. So the equation for this circuit, you begin as usual, you go around
the whole loop and you add everything to 0, then you will find <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>
= <i>R</i> times <i>I</i> + <i>L</i> times <i>dI/dt </i>+ 1 over integral of I
up to time <i>t </i>times 1/<i>C</i>. That's the voltage. Everybody with me on
that part? </p>
<p>That determines the
condition, that determines the current at every instant in time. So if you can
solve this equation, you solve for the current, but what's difficult is that
it's not an algebraic equation. It's not like <i>V = IR</i>, where you divide
by <i>R</i>, you've got the current. This has got integrals, it's got
derivatives. But it turns out that if the voltage is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>,
there's a very clever way to solve this problem, which takes it back almost to
the good old days of <i>V = IR</i>. No differentials, no integrals, nothing.
That's the magic. That was invented by an engineer from GE called Steinmetz.
He put to work some ideas that may seem esoteric, because they involve complex
numbers, but it makes life tolerable for people doing circuit theory. </p>
<p>And here is the
trick: I ignore this problem, and I solve the following problem, purely
mathematical device. The problem I solve has a voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>I&#969;t</sup></i>.
We all realize that you cannot get a source that does that, but it's pure
mathematics. Then the solution to that problem, that voltage, I assume, will
drive some current I call <i>I&#732;</i>. So <i>I&#732;</i> is the answer to the problem
where the driving voltage is not real, but this, if you mathematically write
the same equation. But now we realize that <i>I&#732;</i> can be complex. <i>I&#732;</i>
is not real. It can be a complex number. Just because the voltage is a
complex number, it's an equation, it's got imaginary and real parts on the left
hand side, it will have imaginary and real parts on the right hand side, and so
you'll need both to make it work. But if you have solved this problem, I claim
you have also solved this problem. Why? Because if you take this equation, which
is a complex equation, then the real part on the left hand side will match the
real part on the right hand side. Imaginary part will match the imaginary
part. That's because if you have two complex numbers, <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> and
you say they're equal, you mean <i>x<sub>1</sub> + Iy<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>x<sub>2</sub>
+ Iy<sub>2</sub></i>. And they can be equal only if these guys are equal,
those guys are equal. The real part has to match, the imaginary part has to.
You cannot borrow from the real part and give to the imaginary part. They're
apples and they're oranges, so you've got to match them separately. The closest
analog is a vector equation. If you have a vector equation and you equate two
vectors, so you say vector <i>F</i> is <i>m</i> times vector <i>a</i>, then <i>F<sub>x</sub>
</i>will be <i>m</i> times <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> will
be <i>m</i> times <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>. So there are two equations in one
single vector equation, three in 3D and a complex equation, there are two
equations. </p>
<p>So let's take the
equivalent of the real part in the left hand side and the real part in the
right hand side, and what do you get? The real part of this is the most
important thing. The real part of this is cos<i>&#969;t</i>. that's because <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>
is cos<i>&#969;t </i>+ <i>i</i>sin<i>&#969;t</i>. The real part is just cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
On the right hand side, I should take R times the real part of<i> I&#732;</i>. Let
me just call that guy <i>I</i>. Then I should take <i>L</i> times the
derivative of the real part of <i>I&#732;</i>, which I want to call <i>I</i>. Then 1/<i>C</i>
times the integral of the real part of <i>I&#732;</i>, the real part of <i>I&#732;</i> I
want to call <i>I</i>. In other words, let the real part of <i>I&#732;</i> be called
<i>I</i>. Then we notice that this <i>I</i> is exactly the<i> I</i> that we
want. It satisfies exactly the equation we want to solve. So we have some
good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you solve this equation,
you've also solved this equation. The bad news is, if you cannot even solve the
real equation, what makes you think you can solve this complex equation, right?
I cooked up another problem that looks even more difficult and I say,
&quot;Hey, if you can do that, we can do this.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, it turns out
this complex problem is actually easier to solve than this guy. I'll try to
tell you why it's easier to solve. If you come to this equation, I've told you
repeatedly, any equation involving derivatives and so on, you guess the answer
and you put it in. You try to make a guess. I'm trying to guess, what kind of
function <i>I(t) </i>has the property that when I multiply it by <i>R</i>, I
should get a cos<i>&#969;t</i>, when I differentiate, I should get something like
cos<i>&#969;t</i>, when I integrate, I should get cos<i>&#969;t</i>? That's the only way
left and right will match, and neither cosine nor sine will do the trick. If
you pick the sine, then when you differentiate it, you will get a cosine that
matches. This one integrated, you will get a cosine that matches this, but
this will contain a sine. On the other hand here, since this exponential, if
you make the choice <i>I&#732;(t)</i>, it's <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, it
is going to work. It is going to work because if you take <i>R</i> times that,
you get <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>. If you take the
derivative of this guy, that's <i>I&#969;</i> times the same current. Integral is 1
over <i>I&#969;</i> times the same thing. </p>
<p>That's the beautiful
property of the exponential, that when you differentiate it, just like
multiplying by <i>i&#969;</i>. When you integrate it, it's like dividing by <i>i&#969;</i>,
and when you multiply by <i>R</i>, it's like multiplying by <i>R</i>. So if
you take this assumed solution and put it into that equation, let's see what we
get. We get <i>e<sub>0</sub></i> <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> = (now allow me to
jump one or two steps, because I did it last time. Try to do this in your
head.) <i>R</i> times <i>I&#732;</i> is going to contain <i>R</i> times <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>.
How about <i>L</i> times <i>dI&#732;/dt</i>, then I come with the <i>d/dt</i>, this
guy is a constant. This brings me an <i>I&#969;</i>, so I write <i>I&#969;L</i> times
the same thing. When I integrate, I get 1 over <i>I&#969;</i> times the 1/<i>C</i>
that looks like that. So the time dependence, this is a time dependent
problem, but miraculously, time dependence matches on the two sides. </p>
<p>And now we get this
equation, <i>V<sub>0</sub> = R + i&#969;L + 1/i&#969;C </i>times<i> I&#732;<sub>0</sub></i>.
And our goal was to find <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub></i>, so <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub> = V<sub>0</sub>
</i>divided by this complex number <i>Z</i>. This complex number <i>Z</i> is
called the impedance, and it = <i>R + i&#969;L + 1/i&#969;C</i>, for this problem. I'm
not telling you the answer for every problem, but for this problem, life is
very simple. You find that current as a voltage divided by a number, just like
dividing by <i>R</i>. The only trick is, there are two catches now. First
catch is, this number is not real, so you've got to get used to the fact that
you will work with complex numbers. If you're willing to work with them, you
get this. Second thing is, this is not the current we were supposed to find.
What's the current we were supposed to find? The current that I wanted was the
real part of this <i>I&#732;</i>. That means it's the real part of <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>
divided by--sorry. That's correct. That's what I want. And that's going to be
then the real part of <i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>over <i>Z e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>. We
always pick <i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>to be a real number. The amplitude on the
voltage you can take it to be a real number. Then you write it as a real part
of <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> divided by <i>Z e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. So I should tell
you what this is. I'm saying, imagine the complex number Z, plotted this way.
This is R, this is <i>i&#969;L &#8722; 1/i &#8722; i/&#969;C</i>, and this is the complex number <i>Z</i>.
This is the angle <i>&#934;</i>. Then you write the
same complex number in polar form as a modulus and <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i>.</i> So now you find <i>I
</i>of <i>t</i> is the real part of <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> over mod <i>Z e<sup>i&#969;t
- </sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>, and that we know is
<i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>over mod Z cos<i>(&#969;t &#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i><i>. </i>So that's the final
result. That's the answer to the original question. Now you know trigonometry
well enough to know that cos<i>(&#969;t &#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i><i> </i>is really cos<i>&#969;t</i>cos<i>&#934;</i> + sin<i>&#969;t</i>sin<i>&#934;</i>. So the answer
cannot be just a cos and cannot be a sine. It's a suitably chosen admixture of
sines and cosines that does the trick. </p>
<p>So if you want to, if
you say, &quot;I don't want to deal with complex numbers&quot; you can take a
guess like this and put it in the equation, and after a lot of manipulation,
you will find there is a<i> </i><i>&#934;</i> satisfying this condition. What's the
property of <i>&#934;</i>? Tan of <i>&#934;</i> is <i>&#969;L &#8722; 1/&#969;C </i>divided
by <i>R</i>. But the beauty of the complex numbers is, it just comes out in
one package as the phase of a complex number. I also told you to think about
how you could do this with real numbers. It's not going to be easy to take a
voltage, which is cos<i>&#969;t</i>, divided by anything, to get a current which is
cos<i>(&#969;t &#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i>. There's nothing
you can do to a cosine which will shift its phase. But if you're working with
complex numbers, you can take <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup> </i>divided by <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i> and turn it into <i>e<sup>i&#969;t
- </sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. So in the imaginary
world, it's very easy to shift the phase, because a complex number, when it
multiplies or divides another number, rescales and rotates it. So in the
complex plane, it's very easy to attach the phi, and at the end of the day, you
take the real part. </p>
<p>So you can imagine
doing any realistic problem. Suppose I tell you <i>R</i> is 10 ohms, where <i>&#969;</i>
is some 100<i>&Pi;</i>. <i>L</i> is 3 henries and the capacitance is 2
microfarads, you can find <i>Z.</i> <i>Z</i> for this circuit will be 100--I'm
sorry <i>Z</i> will be 10 + <i>&#969;L</i>, will be 100&Pi; times 3 henries &#8722; 1/<i>&#969;C</i>,
is 100<i>&Pi;</i> times 2×10<sup>-6</sup>. That's some complex number. I forgot
the i here. That is a complex number. I don't want to calculate it. It's
whatever it is. Then it's got a real part which is 10, an imaginary part,
which is this algebraic sum of these two. You can actually plot the real
values you get here in this problem. I'm just going to show you the 10. The
other guy's whatever it is, and you can get the phase. That tells you that in
this problem, the current will have an amplitude which is the volts you apply,
maybe you applied 100 volts, and you divide by this absolute value of <i>Z</i>.
So if you want, I'll complete the last part. The absolute value of <i>Z</i>,
like for any complex number, is <i>R<sup>2</sup> + &#969;L - </i>1 over <i>&#969;C</i>
squared, right? </p>
<p>Any complex number,
the absolute value is real squared + imaginary squared under root. So let's
write in all its glory the current that we want. <i>I(t)</i> is <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R<sup>2</sup>
+ &#969;L</i> - 1 over <i>&#969;C</i> squared cosine of <i>&#969;t - </i><i>&#934;</i> where tan<i>&#934;</i> = <i>&#969;L &#8722; 1/&#969;C</i>
divided by <i>R</i>. Here is the picture, here's <i>R</i>. <i>&#969;L</i> minus <i>1/&#969;C</i>.
There's <i>&#934;</i>. There's a complex
number <i>Z.</i> Okay. So you can imagine now putting numbers and getting
what you want. Notice that the current lags the applied voltage. For example,
if cos<i>&#969;t</i> is a maximum of <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>&#934;</i> was 45 degrees,
you'll have to wait till <i>&#969;t </i>is 45 degrees before the current reaches a
maximum, so it will be lagging the voltage. But sometimes &#934; can come out
negative. Can you see how <i>&#934;</i>
could come out negative? This angle <i>&#934;</i> need not be positive, do you understand
that? What would make it negative? Look at the formula there, <i>&#969;L &#8722; 1/&#969;C</i>.
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> If 1/<i>&#969;C</i> is
bigger than <i>&#969;L</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. If 1 over <i>&#969;C</i> is bigger than <i>&#969;L</i>, this will be more
negative than positive. The complex number may end up like that. So I've
written it for one possible sign. If that flips sign, the <i>&#934;</i> itself will change
sign. It will become <i>&#969;t</i> + 32 degrees. It can go either way. It
depends on who is dominating it, whether the inductor or the capacitor is
dominating it. So let's look at the answer for one other interesting feature. </p>
<p>I want you to know
two things. This trick works only if the voltage is a pure oscillatory
function like cos<i>&#969;t</i>. But then you can write it as a real part of <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>
and do this. Secondly, the impedance is not a constant. Whereas the resistance
is just 10 ohms, impedance varies with frequency. It's a frequency dependent
number that you divide the voltage by to get the current. So the consequence
of this is the following. </p>
<p>Suppose you plot here
the magnitude of the current, let's call it <i>I<sub>0</sub></i>. This whole
thing, let me call it <i>I<sub>0</sub></i>. That's the amplitude of the
current, as a function of frequency for a given applied voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.
So<i> V<sub>0</sub> </i>is fixed, but when <i>&#969; </i>varies, these numbers are
varying. When <i>&#969;</i> goes to 0, you've got a 1 over 0 in the denominator.
That's going to beat everything. And 1 over 0 squared in the denominator means
the whole thing vanishes. The current starts out as 0. That corresponds to the
fact that if your voltage had been a DC source instead of an AC source--that's
what <i>&#969;</i> = 0 means--the capacitor will charge to some point and then stop
the current. That's it. Then it will go up, then come down, because at very
large <i>&#969;</i>, the <i>&#969;L</i> is going to dominate. You get 1 over <i>&#969;L</i>
squared under root, that looks like 1/<i>&#969;L</i>. It will fall like 1/<i>&#969;</i>
at very large frequencies. And it will be the maximum when these two guys
cancel each other. So you've got <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>. If you're trying to
get the maximum current, there's nothing you can do about <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>.
It is what it is. But you can play these two guys against each other and find
a frequency <i>&#969; </i>and <i>R</i> so that this is true and that <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub></i>
is just related to the resonant frequency of the LC combination. So at that
frequency, the current amplitude will be simply--<i>I<sub>0</sub> </i>maximum,
will be simply <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R</i>. It's as if <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> are
not there. You've got them there but they're not there. They're not doing
anything. They neutralize each other. So you can ask, why put something in
that doesn&#39;t do anything? Well, first of all, it does something on other
frequencies. Only at one magical frequency, they go away. But what is
interesting is the very sharp response you have. So do you know where that
comes into play?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Resonance?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Resonance, yeah, but which part of your life? Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Radio.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Radio. You guys know what that is, because I don't. You're always carrying
some recorded medium. But if you listen to radio, like in the old days, you
have this room full of radio signals. Everyone wants your attention. All the
radio stations are all sending signals right now in this room, and you want to
pick just one station that you like. So what happens if that station sends
that information at a certain <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub></i>? And if that's all you
want, you go to the store, buy an LCR circuit, with <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>
chosen so that <i>LC</i> is <i>1/&#969;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, then you will
get a huge response when you get the signal from that station. Now there's
another station with a different frequency. You don't want to listen to them,
but you have to listen to some of them, because if their frequency is here,
your response to that station is not 0. It's a lot smaller than this, but it's
not 0, and there may be yet another station you can hear in the background. </p>
<p>If you don't want to
hear them, you would like to get 0 signal from them, but you cannot kill this
function except at one frequency, but you can make it very sharp. If <i>R</i>
is very, very small, this function will be very large at resonance, because <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R
</i>will be a huge number. It will also be very narrow, so you can make this
thing very sharp. And that's really controlled by the ratio of <i>R</i> to <i>L</i>.
So other stations do give you weak signal, but you can make them weaker and
weaker by picking a very finely tuned oscillator. Now the question is, what if
you changed your mind and you want to listen to these guys? What should you
do? Can you go and buy one radio for this station, one radio for that
station? You know you do something, right? You fiddle with the dial, but what
do you think it does? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Changes the
capacitance.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Changes the capacitance. It's not easy to change the inductance, but it
changes the capacitance. Nowadays if you open a radio, I don&#39;t know what you
will see. It's all glued on to something. But in the old days, when all the
parts were big, you can open the radio and look inside and you have a capacitor
which is called a variable capacitor. You show that with an arrow. You can
also have variable inductors, I suppose, but this is very common. Now how do
you vary the capacitance? Capacitance you know is <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub>A/d</i>.
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Can you change the
surface area?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You can change the surface area, but how do you think you can go change the
surface area?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Having two half
circles and then the current rotates around.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's right. You've got these interlocking plates and you can have them fully
overlapped or not overlapped. If you draw the plates like this, it's got many
things. And these plates can be either really overlapping with the other
plates or pulled out. When you turn the dial, the two things move in and out,
and that varies the capacitance. That will give you a range of frequencies and
that's the range you can hear. </p>
<p>That's one thing.
Another thing I want to mention is, this solution I wrote down, <i>I(t) </i>is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
over mod <i>Z</i> cos<i>(&#969;t &#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i><i> </i>has no free parameters in it. You tell me
the time, I tell you the current. Whatever the voltage is, you take that,
shift the phase by <i>&#934;</i> and divide by mod <i>Z</i>.
But you know that a second order equation in time must have two free
parameters, so where are those free parameters going to come from? Have you seen
this before in your math whatever? No? Okay, I'm going to give you a clue and
you have to think about this clue and see what you get out of that. <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t
</i>= <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i> + 0. That's your clue. What can you do
with that clue? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Set the original
equation equal to 0 to find the complementary solution.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, so I will translate. If you have a problem where you apply one voltage, <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>
and you get a current <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>, and a second voltage <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>
and you get a current <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>, just by adding the two equations,
left hand side to left hand side and right hand side to right hand side, you
can check that <i>V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub></i> drives a current<i> I<sub>1</sub>
+ I<sub>2</sub></i>. If you don't see that, you should do that. Take that
equation, but any <i>V</i> of <i>t</i>, get an answer due to <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>,
call it <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>, another due to <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>, call it <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>
and add them up. Left hand side is clearly <i>V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub></i>
and the right hand side, <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>1</sub> + R</i> times <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>
is <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></i> and so on. So <i>I<sub>1</sub>
+ I<sub>2</sub></i> will satisfy the equation when the driving voltage is the
sum of the two voltages. It all comes because there's nothing nonlinear. For
example, for the right hand side at <i>R</i> times<i> I</i><sup>2</sup>, then
the first equation will have <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>1</sub></i><sup>2</sup>,
second will have <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>2</sub></i><sup>2</sup>. When you add
them, you'll get <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>1</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>I<sub>2</sub></i><sup>2</sup>,
but what you want is really <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub></i>,
the whole thing squared. So if you have nonlinear terms, you cannot add
solutions, but if you have linear terms, you can add solutions. </p>
<p>Therefore 0 is a
hint. It says, add the solution for 0 voltage. You might say, &quot;There is
no solution for 0 voltage,&quot; but I will have to remind you that we did
solve the problem the other day of an LCR circuit connected to nothing that had
a current flowing for a while. But it won't do it if it's completely inert.
But if you have put some charge on this guy to begin with, then you saw that
the current and the charge, everything starts and oscillates exponentially like
<i>e</i> to the - some number <i>t </i>times some cos<i>&#969;&#39;t</i> - some other
phase, call it <i>&#967;</i>. And this thing had two free parameters. There's an
area here and a <i>&#967;</i> here. Or you can write it as <i>e<sup>-</sup></i><i><sup>&#947;</sup></i><i><sup>t</sup></i><i> </i>times <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;&#39;t</i>
+ <i>B</i>sin<i>&#969;&#39;t</i>. No matter how we write it, this function, this
solution to 0 external voltage is called a complementary solution, and the
final solution for <i>I</i> is really what I wrote, <i>V</i> over mod <i>Z </i>cos<i>(&#969;t
&#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i>, + this
complementary function. </p>
<p>Because if you take
this complementary function and add it to the equation, you might think it will
mess up the equation, but it won't, because the I that I wrote down will give
me V<sub>0</sub>cos&#969;t. The complementary function, when you take <i>RI</i> + <i>LdI/dt
</i>+ 1 over <i>C I dt </i>for the complementary part, you will get 0, because
the complementary guy obeys the following equation: it obeys the equation <i>L
dI/dt + R </i>times <i>IC</i> + 1 over <i>C</i> integral <i>IC dt </i>is 0, is
the equation satisfied in that loop. If it has a non-zero solution, you can
add it to your equation. See, in elementary calculus, you learn that if you
solve an equation, say <i>dF/dx </i>= <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, the answer is <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>/2
+[<i>x<sup>3</sup></i>/3] a constant, because when you add a constant, you
don't screw up the solution, because the d/dx kills the constant. Question is,
what can you add to this differential equation? You can add anything, any
function, that's annihilated by that differential equation. If you put the
function in, you get 0 from all the derivatives and integrals, you can add that
to anything. </p>
<p>Therefore the true
answer is this + complementary function. It will contain these two parameters
A and B and you pick them depending on initial conditions. In other words, if
you took an LCR circuit and took a generator and you hooked it up, from the
instant you hooked it up, it won't immediately assume this form that I have
here, because for example, at <i>t</i> = 0, maybe the current is 0 in the real
problem. This current doesn't vanish, but you should add to this, this
function. Choose A and B so that the current vanishes at the = 0. You can fit
the actual experiment to the solution by choosing A and B to match the initial
current and say the initial charge in the capacitor. But we don't usually care
about this guy. Do you know why we don't talk about this too much? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It dies off.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It dies off exponentially, so in real life, it doesn&#39;t matter. If you really
want to know what's happening, in other words, take an LCR circuit, take an AC
source. Put a switch, keep the switch open. The minute you close it, the
current will be 0 by continuity. Current cannot jump. So this function
obviously is not the whole answer. It doesn&#39;t vanish at <i>t</i> = 0. But
this extra part you add in with suitably chosen A and B will fit those initial
conditions. But after oscillating for a while, <i>e</i> to the - something <i>t</i>
for a long<i> t</i> will just go away. Then it will settle down only to this
function. This is called a steady state current and this is called a transient
current. So transients are important; you cannot ignore them. Maybe a
transient will burn your circuit, but it doesn&#39;t matter after a long time. If
you survive the early time, it doesn&#39;t matter for the long time. It's a lot
like this course. </p>
<p>Okay, all right, so
I want to take a minute to tell you a little more about the use of these
complex numbers. I do it for a lot of reasons. Now I don't know what field
you guys are in. You could be in art history. You just don't know when
complex numbers are going to be relevant to what you do, you just don't know.
But I'm serious, if you're doing engineering, electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, it's all about complex numbers, because everybody
writes a differential equation. If it's a linear differential equation, you
solve it with complex numbers. And I like to also show you why sometimes we
should not resist the mathematics so much, because you might think in this
circuit I don't need complex numbers. After all, in the end, the answer was a
cos<i>(&#969;t &#8722; </i><i>&#934;)</i> and that is cos
times some number + sine times some number. I can put the combination and
fiddle with it till it works, that's true. But suppose I gave you a more
complicated circuit. </p>
<p>Here's a more
complicated circuit. I have maybe a resistor, an inductor. Then I come here,
I have a capacitor, maybe another inductor. Go like that, let's call it <i>R<sub>1</sub>,
L<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub></i> and this is some <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
How are you going to solve this problem by guessing? You have no idea how to
guess. You cannot solve this problem by guesswork. But I claim that if you
replace this fellow by <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, you'll be able to
guess the answer, you'll be able to solve the problem. So I want to take a
minute to tell you why that works. So do you know what I'm trying to do now?
I'm trying to tell you that an arbitrarily complex AC circuit built of
resistors, inductors, capacitors, connected any way you like, add whatever you
want, if you go back to the differential equation, it will drive you insane,
because there is a derivative of this current, derivative of that current,
integral of that current, all coupled in some way. How are you going to solve
it? You cannot guess anything cosine and anything sine. It's going to be a
madness. But I will show you that if you use complex numbers, you can reduce
the problem to something that looks like a DC circuit. That's all I want to
do. </p>
<p>So I'm going to give
you the idea, but I don't want to do the whole thing, because I don't want to
spend too much time on algebra. For those of you who want to know where it
comes from, I want to give you a chance. Those of you who don't want to know
exactly where everything comes from, in the end, I will give you the so called
bottom line, stuff you must know, then you'll forget all this. So let's take that
problem. Let me take an easier one that this one, because it's got too many
wrinkles in it. But the point I'm making, I can illustrate just as easily with
this guy. So what did I call it? <i>R<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>,
L<sub>3</sub></i>. Let the current here be <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>. Let the
current here be <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>, current here is <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.
And this is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. Our job is to find those
currents if they're all oscillatory functions of time, in magnitude and in
phase. If you do that, you're done. So how do we do it normally? What are the
fundamental equations for a circuit? The fundamental equations are that at
every branch, the incoming current should be equal to the outgoing current,
which for us means <i>I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub></i>. So <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>
and <i>I<sub>3</sub></i> come down here and they join and become <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>
again, so I'm going to assume that and write <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> there. </p>
<p>So I've got two
unknown currents, <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>. That's the
first thing to understand, how many free, independent currents there are.
Generally, if it's a simple problem, it's equal to the number of loops you
have. That's a loop here, that's a loop there. You can draw many other loops,
like that one and that one, but they will not give you any new results. So
you've got to write voltage equations that say if you go around a loop, and you
come to where you start, the change is 0. The equation I would write would be <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>
= (I'm going to take this loop) <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>L<sub>1</sub>
dI<sub>1</sub>/dt</i> + 1 over <i>C</i> integral <i>I<sub>2</sub> dt&#39;.</i> Back to here is 0. That's one
equation. For the second loop, I can go around the other way if you like,
going round this inductor, or I can take a loop like this. I just want to
write that to show you what it may look like. That equation will say <i>L<sub>3</sub>
dI<sub>3</sub>/dt</i> - 1 over <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> integral <i>I<sub>2</sub>
dt</i> = 0. The - sign comes because if the current is assumed to flow this
way, and your loop goes counter to the current, you're going uphill, so
everything should be subtracted, but if you go down, you can write it going
down this way. So these are the three equations to solve. </p>
<p>They're complicated
because there are differentials, integrals and you know what. But if I solve
the following problem: <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>--so don't bother to
write all of this, because you're not responsible for this detail. I just want
you to know what's going on. So I scrap this problem and I solve this problem,
and the current for that I take to be the twiddle, okay? I say, let the <i>I&#732;</i>&#39;s
be the answer to this problem with <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>. Can you see that if
I took the real part of the first equation, I get the correct equation for the
physical currents; that if I took the real part of the second equation,
everywhere I replace <i>I&#732; </i>by the real part which I call <i>I</i>, and this
becomes <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, I get a second voltage equation. And
here again you drop the twiddles by taking the real part, that's the equation
satisfied by the physical currents, <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.
So it is still true, even in this complicated problem, that once you've solved
it, you may take the real part of the voltage and take the real part of the
current anywhere, that's the answer to the primordial problem. </p>
<p>So why does this make
life easy for you? Because now you may take the current. I'll just take one of
these as an example. Let the current be current <i>I&#732;<sub>1</sub></i>, let it
be <i>I&#732;<sub>1,0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, and <i>I&#732;<sub>2</sub> = I&#732;<sub>2,0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>,
and <i>I&#732;<sub>3</sub></i> is <i>I&#732;<sub>3,0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>. Make that
guess, and what does this mean? Think about it? Go to the first equation.
Equate these twiddle guys and all the <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>'s</i> cancel on all
the three terms, so you get an equation that says <i>I&#732;<sub>1,0</sub> = I&#732;<sub>2,0</sub>
+ I&#732;<sub>3,0</sub></i>. No time dependence anywhere. It looks like a DC
equation. And let's go to this equation here. You will find <i>V<sub>0</sub> =
R</i> times<i> I&#732;<sub>1</sub></i><sub> </sub>+ <i>i&#969;L<sub>1</sub>I&#732;<sub>1</sub></i>
+ <i>1/i&#969;C </i>(I should have called this <i>C<sub>2</sub></i>) <i>&#969;C<sub>2</sub></i>
times <i>I&#732;<sub>2</sub></i>. <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>'s</i> have been canceled
everywhere. So what do you find? This again looks like an Ohm's law problem
where R<sub>1</sub> is the impedance of this guy, <i>i&#969;L<sub>1</sub></i> is the
impedance of that guy, so the whole thing looks like some <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>
times <i>I&#732;<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i> times<i> I&#732;<sub>2</sub></i>.
In other words, let me just write it below this here. </p>
<p>The equation we get
is, <i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>= <i>Z<sub>1</sub> </i>times <i>I&#732;<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>
times <i>I&#732;<sub>2</sub></i>. So the problem will look like this: just put some
black box here, <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>, another black box, <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>,
another black box, <i>Z<sub>3</sub></i>, join them, bring them out. Call the
current here as <i>I&#732;<sub>1,0</sub></i>, the current here is <i>I&#732;<sub>2,0</sub></i>,
the current here is <i>I&#732;<sub>3,0</sub></i>. And these constant numbers, they
have no time dependence, obey the same equations as the real currents did in
the real problem. So it's like a DC problem. The only subtlety is, the
impedances are complex, and the rule for impedance is very simple. If you open
the box and you find a resistor + an inductor, the impedance for that is <i>R<sub>1</sub>
+ i&#969;L<sub>1</sub></i>. That's it. Apart from that variation, it is just like
DC circuits. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is there any
physical significance to the imaginary part of the solution?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. If you want, the imaginary part of the solution is the answer to a person
whose voltage was <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>sin<i>&#969;t</i>. So you are solving two
problems, but we believe that it's nothing new. If you can do cos<i>&#969;t</i>,
the answer to sin<i>&#969;t</i> is the same, except you shift by <i>&Pi;</i>/2.
Everything looks the same. But it answers that question. </p>
<p>Okay, so this is
what I want you to know. Given an AC circuit, here's what you do. You make
this rule: whenever you see this guy, it is <i>R</i>. Whenever you see this
guy, it is <i>i&#969;L</i> and whenever you see this guy, it's 1/<i>i&#969;C</i>. Then
you can combine impedances in series by adding them, or in parallel by doing
the reciprocals and adding them, then taking the inverse of that. It's all
like DC circuits. What will you have at the end? At the end, you will have
found out every current <i>I&#732;<sub>0,&#945;</sub></i>. <i>&#945;</i> is 1, 2 or 3 in this
problem. You solve these DC like equations and you will find these DC like
currents, but they'll be complex. What is the relation of this guy to the
actual current flowing through the actual circuit element? </p>
<p>The answer is <i>I<sub>&#945;</sub>(t)</i>
will be <i>I&#732;<sub>&#945;</sub></i> times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, then take the real
part. That's the algorithm. That's the relation between these time
independent functions, because what did you do? You stripped their time
dependence. You wrote every current as <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> times a number
that doesn&#39;t depend on time. It's those numbers that we have solved for. But
to go back to the original current, first you've got to reinstate the
exponential you canceled everywhere and remember to take the real part because
that was the deal. It's called the real deal, real deal. You take the real
part of your answer. </p>
<p>How about following?
You've solved a very complicated circuit. I don't even know what's going on.
Here's one guy. It's part of a big mess. Its impedance is <i>Z</i>. There is
a current, <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub></i> going through it, meaning it's the complex
amplitude of that. If I ask you, what is the actual voltage across this? If I
put a volt meter here, what will I measure? Answer will be, again, <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub></i>
times <i>Z</i>. That's in the fake Ohm's law calculation, but you've got to
remember that these all had time dependence, which I removed. Then you've got
to remember that I should take the real part of the answer. </p>
<p>That will be the
actual instantaneous voltage across that circuit element at that time t. But
remember, <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub></i> could be a complex number. The <i>Z</i> inside
the box could be a complex number. When you multiply them, you've got lots of
complex numbers. You add on to get this guy and take the real part. I would
recommend, when you come to such problems, that every complex number like <i>Z</i>,
you write as an absolute value times e to the i times some phase. That makes
your life easier, because then the whole thing will be the absolute value of
this times the absolute value of that, times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> + the phase
of this + the phase of that. And the real part of it is the cosine of <i>&#969;t</i>
+ these two phases. You understand? So if you wrote it as mod times <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sub>1</sub></i>, absolutely value of
<i>Z e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sub>2</sub></i>, times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, what
is the real part of this crazy number? These are all real numbers? You pull them
out, combine the exponentials, you'll get <i>e<sup>i&#969;t + i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i><sub>1</sub></i> from this one, <i>i</i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>2</sub></i> from that one. So
the full current will be cos(<i>&#969;t + </i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>1</sub></i><i> + </i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>2</sub></i>). So the answer
will be mod <i>I<sub>0</sub></i> mod <i>Z</i> cos(<i>&#969;t</i> <i>+ </i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>1</sub></i><i> + </i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>2</sub></i>). So I don't mind
waiting to give you some time to digest this. You should be able to at least
solve simple DC circuits with more than one loop. If you've got only one loop,
just do what we did earlier, V over Z and all that. But if you've got two
loops, you should learn how to handle that problem, because it's very useful.
You're going to deal with circuits no matter what you do. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> In the initial
problem, if you were just trying to find the total current through the system,
impedances add, like--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's what I said. That's correct. So let us ask the following question. His
question was, what if I'd like to know the current coming out of this guy?
Right? Everybody with me? That was his question? So we do it as if
everything were real. First we combine these two guys into a single impedance,
which will be <i>Z<sub>2</sub> Z<sub>3</sub></i> divided by <i>Z<sub>2</sub> +
Z<sub>3</sub></i>, just like you combine resistors in parallel. To that guy, I
will add <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>. That whole thing is the impedance seen by this
thing. Divide the voltage by this total effective impedance, that will give
you the current coming here. Yes? Take that current, multiply by <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>
times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, take the real part. That's the instantaneous
voltage on this one. Here's one more thing: when that current comes here, how
is it going to branch between these two? In DC circuits, if this was <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>,
this is <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, and the current comes here, its propensity to go
on this side is proportional to that resistor, because if that is more
resistive, it's more likely to go here. So the fraction going to this side
will be <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> divided by <i>R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub></i>.
The fraction going to this branch will be <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> divided by <i>R<sub>1
</sub>+ R<sub>2</sub></i>. You replace all of the <i>R</i>&#39;s with <i>Z</i>&#39;s
and you get the same result. </p>
<p>So you can do
everything like before, except you've got to get used to complex numbers.
Here's the problem: take the circuit assigned to each element, these
impedances. Add them like in the old days, combine them like in the old days,
solve for the current. To get the physical current, multiply by <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>
</i>and take the real part. To find the drop against any entry, any element,
take the current there times the impedance, times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>, then
take the real part. That's it. I cannot say it anymore because I don&#39;t know
another way to say it. You've just got to do problems so you get a feeling for
how it's done. I wanted you to understand, sometimes you take a problem, you
embed it in a bigger family of problems that looks more difficult, but is
actually easier. It's even true, there are many integrals you try to do which
are very difficult. But if you think of it as an integral in the complex
plane, sometimes that problem's easier to solve than the real integral, so this
happens a lot. You take a problem, you generalize it. Sometimes the
generalized problem is easier than the original one. </p>
<p>Now I'm going to give
you one counter-example, let me see where to pick it, where this rule about
taking the real part at the end of the day fails. So far the rule was, do
everything with a complex thing. At the end of the day when you've found
something, you take the real part. Here is a place where it does not work, so
let me tell you where it is. Take the LCR circuit, where we found that the
voltage was <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, and the current was <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
over absolute value of <i>Z</i>cos<i>(&#969;t - </i><i>&#934;)</i>, where <i>&#934;</i> is all that stuff. I
don't want to repeat it. What is the instantaneous power generated by the
power supply? The instantaneous power for any voltage source equals the
voltage at that instant times the current at that instant. And all of these
are real voltages and real currents. I'm not doing any
games right now. This is the real thing. So what do you get here? You get <i>V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>
over mod <i>Z</i> cos<i>&#969;t</i> times cos<i>(&#969;t - </i><i>&#934;)</i>. That's what it is,
right? One voltage going like cos and the current is going like cos<i>(&#969;t - </i><i>&#934;)</i>. So I want to write
this out for you as follows: this is cos<sup>2</sup><i>&#969;t </i>cos<i>&#934;</i> + sin<i>&#969;t</i> cos<i>&#969;t
</i>cos<i>&#934;</i>. This is just some
high school trig identities. Cos of <i>A</i> + <i>B</i> is cos <i>A</i> + cos <i>B</i>
+ sine <i>A</i> sine <i>B</i>. So what do you notice? Cos<i>&#934;</i> and sin<i>&#934;</i> are some constants,
but these are functions of time and they're all oscillating. The reason they
are oscillating is that when you drive a current in these circuits, sometimes
the <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> are drawing energy from the source, sometimes they're
giving it back. So sometimes it's not monotonic, it's not always drawing
energy. Sometimes it's taking it, sometimes it's giving it back. That's all
the oscillatory terms. So what one likes to study is called the average power
over a full cycle. </p>
<p>That means you take
this time dependent function, you integrate it over time, over a full cycle at
frequency &#969; and you divide by the time. And I ask what you get. So let me
write the obvious parts, <i>V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over mod Z. Cosine
square is a positive definite number. Its average over a cycle is 1 half. I
don't know how you want me to show this. One is to say cos<sup>2</sup><i>&#952;</i>
is 1 + cos2<i>&#952;</i>/2. And if you integrate that guy over a full cycle, the
cosine 2<i>&#952;</i> is periodic. It gives you 0, you get 1 half. Sin<i>&#969;t</i>
cos<i>&#969;t</i>, if you put a 2 and divide by 2, is proportional to sin2<i>&#969;t</i>.
That guy completes 2 cycles in one period. Its average is definitely 0. So
the only thing that survives then from all of this is the cosine <i>&#934;</i> term and the 1 over
2, because average of cosine squared is half. So the average power in the
circuit looks like <i>V<sup>2</sup></i>/2 mod <i>Z</i> cos<i>&#934;</i>. That's the correct
result. In fact, we can see it in another way. Let's write it as <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
over mod <i>Z</i> squared times mod <i>Z</i> cosine <i>&#934;</i> over 2. What is mod
<i>Z</i> cos<i>&#934;</i>? Can you tell from
some picture I drew of <i>Z</i>? I don't know if I have any picture. I've
hidden all of them. But here is what <i>Z</i> looks like. That is <i>Z</i>,
that's <i>&#934;</i>, this is <i>R</i>,
this is <i>&#969;L</i> &#8722; 1/<i>&#969;C</i>. What is mod <i>Z</i> cos<i>&#934;</i>? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Shouldn't it just
be R?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It is just the resistance. So this is a fancy way for <i>R</i>. So this is
just 1 over 2. If you want, it's just the amplitude of the current squared
times <i>R</i>. That means the real energy loss is taking place only in the
resistor. You can write that as mod <i>Z</i> cosine <i>&#934;</i> if you like. The 1
half is new to AC circuits. In a DC circuit, it's just <i>I<sup>2</sup>R</i>,
because it's constant. Here it's oscillating like a cosine squared and the
average of that is 1 half. So what people sometimes like to do is to find
something called the RMS current, which is <i>I<sub>0</sub></i>/&#8730;2, and to
define the RMS voltage, which is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/&#8730;2. Then the whole thing
looks like <i>I<sub>0</sub>I<sub>rms</sub><sup>2</sup>R</i>, or if you like, <i>V<sub>rms</sub></i>
times <i>I<sub>rms</sub></i>, period. Now RMS means root mean squared.
There's a reason why for a trigonometric function, it's got a number which is 1
over root 2 times the amplitude, but I don't want to go into that, because we
don't use it again. The main thing to know is that, if you want, you can
redefine a new quantity, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/&#8730;2 and <i>I<sub>0</sub></i>/&#8730;2,
so that these factors of 2 disappear, and things look like the good old days of
resistive circuits. </p>
<p>So very often when
they say this is a 110 volt power supply, they really mean the RMS value 110
volts. That means <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/&#8730;2 is 110. <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> itself
is 110 &#8730;2. So the actual voltage goes up and down from +110 &#8730;2 to -110 &#8730;2.
Because for computation of power, the peak amplitude doesn't control it. It's
this RMS value that controls the average power consumption. Now there is a way
to get the power using the complex numbers, if you like. I'm going to assign
that as a homework problem, rather than do it here. But I want you to think
about why does it fail here? Why is it that when you come to the power, this
is not simply--in other words, what I'm telling you is the power is not simply
the real part of <i>I&#732;t</i> and <i>V&#732;t</i>. <i>V&#732;</i> is a 1 with <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>.
Why is it that taking the real part of this guy doesn't work? Everywhere else,
we took the real part of the current, we got the right answer, real part of the
voltage, we got the right answer, but not when you take the real part of this.
Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student</b>:
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, he's saying you're multiplying but not adding. So let me say the
following: suppose you had a complex number <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>, it's <i>x<sub>1</sub>
+ Iy<sub>1</sub></i>, and another complex number <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>, which is
<i>x<sub>2</sub> + Iy<sub>2</sub></i>. If you take the real part of <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i>
you get <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>. You take the real part of <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>
you get <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. But suppose you wanted <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>
for some reason. That is the real part of <i>Z<sub>1</sub></i> times the real
part of <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>. That does not = the real part of <i>Z<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub></i>.
Because the real part of <i>Z<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>2</sub></i> has got <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>,
that's pretty obvious, but it's always got -<i>y<sub>1</sub> y<sub>2</sub></i>,
because when these two imaginaries multiply, they can contribute a real part.
But what you wanted is the analog of this one. So you can fix that. I mean,
it's not that you can never extract <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>. The
correct solution is <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>Z + Z&#42;</i> over 2 x2 <i>Z<sub>2</sub></i>
+ <i>Z<sub>2</sub>&#42;</i> over 2, and you can multiply it all out and see what
happens. Then you can write the answer in terms of these guys, if you like,
but I'd rather just leave it this way, because it's not going to be used
extensively. I just want you to be careful. This is an example of something
that is quadratic in the interesting quantities. You cannot take the real part
at the end of the calculation, only for things which are linear. </p>
<p>Every time, the real
and imaginary parts do not talk to each other throughout the whole
calculation. You can follow them through and at the end take the real part as
what's interesting. But if you're going to multiply two things, where you have
added on a complex part to this guy and a complex part to this guy, in the
product, you've added on something real, and that was not your intention, so
you've got to take that out. That's what makes it complicated. Therefore I
tell you that when you do these AC circuits, when it comes to power, forget any
of the gimmicks you learned. You will be usually asked to find the power only
for LCR circuit, the single loop like that, then just go back to this one.
It's just <i>I<sup>2</sup>R</i> written in this language. And cosine <i>&#934;</i> is called the power
factor. </p>
<p>Okay, so this
completes one chunk of the course. I'm really going to the finishing line for
electromagnetic theory. There's only one big stuff left, then we'll do optics
and then we'll do quantum mechanics. Now the nice thing about quantum
mechanics is that you don't have to worry about whether you will get it,
because nobody gets it. My idea is to take a class where only I don't get it,
and turn it into a class where everybody don't get it. That's the plan. When
I say &quot;get it,&quot; I think I talked to one of you guys who called me and
said something which is quite true. They said, &quot;In the first part of the
course, we could visualize what you were doing. There were masses rolling down
and things colliding. With electricity and magnetism, we're not afraid of the
math, but we don't have an intuitive feeling for these things.&quot; So I
agree. But if you work long enough with electricity and magnetism, you get
used to them. The only things born with the knowledge of electricity and
magnetism are some creatures, like ducks. </p>
<p>Apparently, ducks can
feel the earth's magnetic field and they are just going through and they know
which way to go. They don't solve Maxwell's equation, but they know how to
travel. And some bees are sensitive to the polarization of light, so they do
respond to certain things in an intrinsic way people don't. So you have to get
used to it only by doing more problems. But in quantum theory, any intuitive
feeling you have is actually a detriment. It will get you in trouble, because
nothing is the way you imagine it. So no one has an advantage over anybody
else. So it's better not to be well informed. So you may be saying,
&quot;Hey, here is the course for me,&quot; right? So the less you know, the
better off you are in quantum mechanics. So don't worry about that. It's a
very strange world and I want to give you an introduction to that. Anyway,
they are the two things. So what's left now is just electromagnetic waves, and
we're sort of building up to electromagnetic waves. </p>
<p>So I'm going to start
by writing here the equations that we know about electromagnetism as of now.
So the surface integral of the electric field on any surface is the charge
enclosed divided by <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. That's called Gauss's law. The line
integral of the electric field on a closed loop used to be 0 when things are
static. But when things are changing with time, it's the rate of change of the
magnetic flux. The surface integral of the magnetic field, <i>B&#8901;dA</i> is just 0 all the
time, because there are no magnetic monopoles. There's nothing from which
lines come out. So if you integrate any configuration, the lines don't start
and end anywhere, so whatever enters the surface leaves the surface. The surface
integral of <i>B</i> is always 0. <i>B&#8901;dA</i> is 0. The line integral of <i>B&#8901;dA</i>--<i>b&#8901;dl</i> is <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I</i>.
That's the old Ampere's law. These are the four equations we have. Now it
turns out this is not still the end. It's not the end. There's one more
fiddling you have to do. That's the last part I want to talk about. </p>
<p>Remember, this itself
came from new experiments where you started moving magnets and so on, found a
current whenever there's a changing magnetic flux. That's the induced electric
field due to changing flux. So here is the thought process that led Mr.
Maxwell to a little paradox. So here is some circuit. We don't know where it
begins or ends; we don't care. Here's the circuit. There's a current flowing
through a capacitor. When I say flowing through a capacitor, I hope you know
what it means. I want you to be very clear about this. Suppose you connect it
to some AC source. I want you all to know what's going on. Nothing really flows
through the gap in the capacitor. It's not possible. What happens is, for a
while, + charges rush here and - charges rush the other plate, because that's
the polarity of my AC source. Later on it's reversed, then - charges go here
and + charges go there. So there is an alternating current in the circuit, but
there is no current flowing right through in one sense. But there's nothing to
keep it from going this way and that way and this way and that way, because
they don't have to jump the gap to do that. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's sort of a
random question, but you know how we were talking about jumping the gap. When
would it actually jump the gap?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It will jump the gap if the--here is what happens. It depends on what's in the
medium. If you put air, for example, the air molecules are all neutral, so
there is no way for the + charges to ride them and go to the - charge, to the -
terminal. But if the electric fields, this certainly will produce electric
field, they're so strong that they rip out the + and - charges, that suddenly
you've got a bunch of free carriers, then the - charges can immediately go and
neutralize this one, + can go and neutralize that one. That's like a lightning
strike inside the little world. That's what happens to us during lightning.
We are in a capacitor. The lower plate is the earth, upper plate is the
clouds. And after a while, there's a heavy charging. At some point, they
cannot take it anymore, and they ionize the air and they create a little path
and the current flows through that, and the clouds are discharged. </p>
<p>Okay, so here is a
problem that Maxwell had. He says, let's look at this equation, <i>B&#8901;dl</i> in a closed loop = <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I</i>,
where I is the current passing through any surface with that loop as the
boundary. Remember that? So if you draw a loop here like that, then some
current is crossing that shaded surface. And the line integral of <i>B</i>,
you know <i>B</i> fields go around the current and the line integral of <i>B</i>
around a loop will be the current crossing that shaded surface. That's how we
get Ampere's law. But now you say, that's not the only surface with that loop
as the boundary. I should be able to draw any surface with the loop as the
boundary. So you say let me take that surface. You are still okay, because
whatever current passes this phase also passes through that phase. The law is
still good. So giddy with success, you say, why not this? That's my new
surface. It goes all the way around one of the plates of the capacitor and
comes back. Now I have a problem. </p>
<p>I have a problem
because there is no current passing that surface. Nothing going on between the
plates in terms of current. If I draw an even bigger one like this one, I am
again okay, because now that same current is passing through this one. It's
this surface in between that things don't work. You follow that? We have a
crisis where if you say it's <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I</i> and you say it's on any
surface with this loop as the boundary, it's the boundary of the surface, then
this kind of surface, half in and half out, has a problem. So what will you
do? You realize you have to modify your equations. It's quite often how
people modify equations. Sometimes they do experiments, sometimes they do
thought experiments. Einstein loved doing these experiments, which are called
Gedanken experiments. You don't really do the experiment, but you say,
&quot;If I did this, what will happen?&quot; There&#39;s a little paradox, and you
have to modify your theory. So there are two reasons to modify the theory.
One is experiments tell you is wrong; other is, theory tells you there's a
problem. </p>
<p>So you have to add
something to this. That something I add should not have any contribution from
this surface, but on this surface, it should make exactly the same contribution
as the physical current made on this surface, so that no matter which surface I
take, I get the same answer. And I'm going to do that by the--there are many
ways to do this. If you know more math, there are more ways to get this, but
this is one that's good enough. I'm going to do the following? I'm going to
rewrite this as follows. You see in the region between the plates, I have no
current, I agree. I gave up. I do have something between the plates I don't
have in the wire. You know what that is? Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Electric field.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You have an electric field. There's something non 0 in between the plates. So
I'm going to write this <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I </i>somehow in terms of electric
field between the plates and let's see how it goes. So I'm rewriting the very
same term, <i>I</i> is <i>dQ/dt</i>. <i>Q</i> is the charge of the capacitor.
And let me write it as <i>Q/&#949;<sub>0</sub> d</i> by <i>dt</i>. Now let me write
it as <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>A</i>d by dt of <i>Q/A </i>divided by <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>.
That = <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>A</i> times <i>d</i> by <i>dt</i> of the
electric field between the plates. Why is that? Because the electric field is
<i>&#963;/&#949;<sub>0</sub> </i>and <i>&#963;</i> is just <i>Q/A</i>. Now bring that <i>A</i>
in here and you get <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub> d</i> by <i>dt</i> of
electric field times <i>A</i>. But that we can write as <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>,
the surface integral of the electric field over the surface, and that's what we
call <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> electric flux, <i>d</i> by <i>dt</i>.
Therefore my modified law is going to be <i>B&#8901;dl</i> = <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I
+ &#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub> d </i>by <i>dt</i> of <i>&#934;</i><i><sub>electric</sub></i>. </p>
<p>That's the bottom
line. You can fill in these blanks if you have trouble writing and listening.
I'm just saying, go to the region between the plates. Once you start with <i>dQ/dt</i>,
turn <i>Q</i> into the <i>&#963;</i>, the charge density on the plates. That's
simply the electric field, then you'll find, this is simply the electric flux,
rate of change times <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. This extra term is
called the displacement current. I don&#39;t know why it's called that name, but
you know that you have to put that extra term. But now look at this equation
with that extra term. Notice it works everywhere. If you took a surface like
the first one I took, that slices through the wire here, there's no electric
field anywhere, inside a perfect conductor or anything, there's going to be no
electric field. Then <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>I</i> is going to contribute. If I go to
the region between the plates, there is no <i>I</i> there, but there's the rate
of change of electric flux. Therefore the last Maxwell equation, the Ampere's
law, is going to be modified with an extra term, <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>
d</i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>electric</sub></i><i>/dt</i>. And it has a nice
symmetry now, that the line integral of the electric field is the rate of
change of magnetic flux. The line integral of the magnetic field contains a
rate of change of electric flux. It's got other stuff, but it's got that extra
term. So I'm going to come next time and start looking at these equations. And
remarkably, these equations imply there are electromagnetic waves. Without the
benefit of any charge, without the benefit of any current, there'll be electric
and magnetic fields. That's the interesting part. We know electric fields can
be produced by charges, and magnetic fields can be produced by currents, but
I'm saying go light years from everything. No &#961;, no charge density, no current
density. There'll be non-zero <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> just moving on their own,
and you want to understand how that happens. </p>
<p>First of all, it's
amazing it's predicted by this stuff. So basically, this is a very important
day in your life, because now you know, all of electromagnetism is that
equation + that equation. This is it. There is no more stuff any of us knows,
at least in classical theory. In quantum theory, there's new stuff. Classical
electromagnetism is only that. So you don't have to pack your head with all
kinds of results. You can derive everything from these. Okay, so let's do that
on Wednesday.</p>
