<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> So, let's begin now. First of
all, I'm assuming all of you have some idea what special relativity
means. There are two theories of relativity, one is the special theory
and one is the general theory. The general theory is something that we
won't do in any detail. Special theory is something we will do in
reasonable detail. So, it's good to begin by asking some of you what is
your present understanding of what the subject is all about. Yes, sir?
The Yale cap, what do you think it's about?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's about relative speed in two reference
systems.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, it's about relative speed
in two reference systems. Yes? I'll come to you; then I'll come to
you.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's based on the postulate that the laws of physics
are the same in any two references moving in uniform motion relative to
one another and the speed of light is constant in all references.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, I will take the last row
there.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Okay, so what I've heard so far
is that the laws of physics are the same for two people who are both in
inertial frames of reference and the velocity of light's a constant.
Right. That's certainly the way we understand the special relativity
theory. But it's a very old one. It's been going on long before
Einstein came. There was a theory of relativity at the time of Newton
and that's where I want to begin. Relativity is not a new idea at all,
it's an old one. And the old idea can be illustrated in this way and it
will agree with your own experience.</p>

<p>So, the standard technique for all of relativity is to get these
high speed trains. I'm going to have our own high speed train; this is
the top view of the train. And like in everything I do, we'll get away
with the lowest number of dimensions, which happens to be this one
spatial dimension and of course there is time. So, the train is moving
along the <i>x</i> axis. You are in this train. You board the train and
all the blinds are closed because you don't want to look outside.
That's not because you're traveling through some parts of New Jersey;
you don't want to look outside for this particular experiment. You get
into the train, you settle down and you explore the world around you.
You pour yourself a drink, you play pool, you juggle some ping pong
balls, tennis balls, and you have a certain awareness of what's
happening, namely, your understanding of the mechanical world, and then
you go to sleep. When you are sleeping, some unseen hand gives to this
train a large velocity, 200 miles an hour. The question is, "When you
wake up, can you tell if you're moving or not?" That's the whole
question. Will this speed, whatever I gave you, 200 miles per
hour--will it do anything to you in this train that will betray that
velocity? So, when you wake up will you say I'm moving or not? Now, you
might say, I'm not moving because I'm on Amtrak and I know this train
is not going anywhere.</p>

<p>That kind of sociological reason, by the way, there are many of
them, you cannot invoke. You can only say, "I'm on this train. Is
anything different?" And the claim is that nothing will be different.
You just will not know you are moving. Now, if the train picks up
speed, or slows down, you will know right away. If it picks up speed or
accelerates, you find yourself pushed against the back of the seat or
if the driver slams on the brake, you will slam into the front of the
seat in front of you. No one is saying that when the motion is
accelerated, you will not know. Accelerated motion can be detected in a
closed train without looking outside. The question is uniform velocity,
no matter how high, can that be perceived? Can that be detected?</p>

<p>So, at the time of Galileo and Newton everybody agreed that you
cannot detect it. Remember that if you started out and Newton's laws
worked for you, you are called an inertial observer. One of the laws
you want is, if you leave something, it should stay where it is. When
the train is accelerating, that won't be true. You leave things on the
floor when it's accelerating, things will slide backwards. So, with no
apparent force acting on it, things will begin to accelerate; that's a
non-inertial frame. We are not interested in that. You started out as
an observer for whom the laws of Newton work, the laws of inertia work,
F = ma, then you go to sleep and you wake up. So, when I said
everything looks the same, I really meant that the laws of Newton
continue to be the same because if the laws of Newton are the same,
everything will look the same. That's what it means to say "everything
looks the same." Our expectations of what happens when I throw it up or
what happens when two billiard balls collide, everything is connected
to the laws of Newton. So, the claim is, the laws of Newton will be
unchanged when this velocity is added on to you.</p>

<p>Now, we should be clear about one thing. If there is a train next to
you in the beginning -- let me just put it on this side for convenience
-- and you got in and you boarded this train but you looked at this
train and it was not moving. If you lift the blind and look through,
you'll see the other train and there's another passenger in the other
train and you look at each other, you're not moving. When you wake up
after this brief nap, you find when you look outside the other train is
moving at 200 miles an hour. The question is, "Can you tell if it's you
who's responsible for this relative motion, or maybe nothing happened
to you and the other train is moving the opposite way?" And the claim
of relativity is that you really cannot tell. You can tell there is
motion between the two trains that wasn't there before. That's very
clear if you look outside but there is no way to tell what actually
happened when you were sleeping. Whether you were given the velocity of
200 to the right or the other train was given a velocity of 200 to the
left or maybe a combination of the two, you just cannot tell. That's
the word "relative."</p>

<p>So far -- I didn't tell you -- if you have only one train, what I
told you earlier, is that uniform velocity does not leave its imprint
on anything you can measure. If you look outside, of course you can see
the motion of the other train, but you still cannot tell who is moving.
You cannot distinguish between different possibilities. So, you have
every right to insist that you are not moving and the other train is
moving the opposite way. Once again, you can make this argument only
for uniform relative motion. If your train is accelerating, now I'm
saying it as if it is an absolute thing, and it is. You cannot say,
"I'm not accelerating, the other train is accelerating in the other
direction." You cannot say that because you're the one who is barfing
up and throwing up and slamming your head on the wall; nothing is
happening to the other person. You cannot say "I'm still in the same
frame, you are going the opposite way." If you are going the opposite
way, why am I throwing up? Or if you are in a rocket and the rocket's
taking off and the <i>G</i> forces are enormous, many times your
weight, it is the astronauts who are going through the discomfort. At
that time they cannot say we are at rest and everyone is going the
opposite way because no one else is in danger, but they are.</p>

<p>So, accelerated motion will produce effects. You cannot talk your
way out of that. But uniform velocity will produce no effects on you
and no effects on the other person. You can detect relative motion but
you cannot in any sense maintain that you are moving and he's not or
that he's moving and you are not. You can say, "I am at rest, things
are the same as before, the train is moving the opposite way." Now, if
you go in the Amtrak and you look outside and you don't see another
train, but you see the landscape, you see trees and cows and
everything, going at 200 miles an hour in the opposite direction, you
have some reason to believe that probably the ground is not moving and
you are moving. But that's just based on what I called earlier some
sociological factors. In other words, it's completely possible to
devise an experiment in which somebody puts the whole landscape on
wheels and when you go to sleep the landscapes, cows and trees are made
to move the opposite way. Not very likely, but that's because we know
in practice no one is going to bother to do that just to fool you. But
if that did happen, you won't know the difference. So, the reason we
rule that out is we know some extraneous things not connected to the
laws of physics. That's why we don't like to open the window and look
at the landscape because then we have a bias. Open the window and look
at another train and you just won't know. That is the principle of
relativity, that uniform motion between two observers, both of whom are
inertial, is relative. Each one can insist that he or she is not
moving; the other person is the one who is moving.</p>

<p>Of course, now, if the two, in reality, if the two trains were at
rest--Let's imagine my train got accelerated. So, during the time it
was accelerated, I would know, but if I was sleeping at the time, I
don't know and when I wake up and the acceleration is gone and the
velocity is constant, that's when I say, "I just cannot tell."</p>

<p>All right. Now, let's show once and for all that the laws of Newton
are not going to be modified. So, you find the laws of Newton before
you go to sleep, you wake up, you find them again, you'll get the same
laws; that's the claim. I hope you understand that all the mechanical
things you see in the world around you come just from <i>F = ma</i>. We
have seen projectiles and collision of billiard balls and rockets;
they're all Newtonian mechanics. So, to say that things will look the
same is to say the laws of Newton that you will deduce before and after
waking up will be the same. So, let's show that. When you show that,
you're really done with it once and for all.</p>

<p>So, let's do the following. Here is the <i>x</i> axis and here is my
frame of reference. This is my x axis. Let's call this the origin. The
frame goes to negative and positive <i>x</i> values. Pick some object
sitting at the point <i>x</i>. Now, we are going to first define the
notion of an event. An event is something that happens at a certain
place at a certain time; that's called an event. For example, if
there's a little firecracker going off somewhere at some time, the
<i>x</i> is where it happened and the <i>t</i> is when it happened. So,
this is space-time. Once again, space-time does not require Einstein
coming in at all. We have known for thousands of years that if you want
to set up a meeting with somebody, you've got to say where and you've
got to say when and things do happen in space-time. The fact that you
need <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>, or, if you're living in three spatial
dimensions, the fact that you need <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> and
<i>t</i> is not new. That is not the revolution Einstein created. The
fact that you need four coordinates to label an event is nothing new.
What he did that is new will be clear later. So, does everyone
understand what an event means? Okay? An event is something that
happens and to say exactly where and when it happened, in our world of
one dimension, we give it an <i>x</i> and we give it a <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>Now, that's me, and I'm going to give my frame of reference the name
<i>S</i>. It turns out <i>S</i> is not just based on just my name. This
is the canonical name for two observers, one is called <i>S</i> and one
is called <i>S</i> prime. So, <i>S</i> prime, let's say, is you. So,
your frame of reference is going to be taken to be sliding relative to
mine. So, let's draw a <i>y</i> axis here. We don't really deal with
the <i>y</i> coordinate but just to give you a feeling, this is my
<i>y</i> axis; that's my <i>x</i> axis; this is my origin. <i>y</i> is
not going to play a big role. Now, you are sliding this way, to the
right, and your speed or velocity is always denoted by <i>u</i>. Some
number of meters per second, you are zooming to the right at some speed
<i>u</i>. So, imagine now you are going past me. At some instant--I'm
sitting here at the origin of coordinates, you cross me and then a
little later you are somewhere there. So, that's your <i>y</i> frame
axis; that's your origin. And the same event you say has a coordinate
<i>x</i> prime. We arrange it so that when you zoom past me, you set
your clock to zero and I set my clock to zero. When you want to set the
clock to zero is completely arbitrary. So, we will decide right when
you pass me. I'm at the origin of my coordinates, you're at the origin
of your coordinates. When you pass me, we'll click our stop watches and
we will set the time to zero. So, here's an event. You and I crossed.
What are the coordinates for that event? According to me, that event
occurred at <i>x</i> = 0 and the time was chosen to be zero. According
to you, your origin was also on top of my origin, so <i>x</i> prime was
zero and the time is just the time. Everybody has a single time, and
that time is called zero. That is one event. We made the coordinate of
the event zero zero for both you and me. It is zero in space because my
origin crossed your origin. That crossing took place at my origin;
that's why my <i>x</i> is zero and took place at your origin, that's
where your <i>x</i> prime is zero and the common time we chose to be
zero by convention.</p>

<p>Then, we want a second event. So, let's say the second event is some
firecracker going off here. Here is something I should explain that I
used to forget in the previous years. When I say I am moving, I imagine
I am part of a huge team of people who are all moving with me. So, I've
got agents all over the <i>x</i> axis who are my eyes and ears; they
are looking out for me. So, even though I am here, if there's a
firecracker exploding here, my guys will tell me. And you are carrying
your own agents. Let's say at every point <i>x</i> you have a reporter,
<i>x</i> = 1, 2, 3, 4; there are people sitting and watching. So, when
I say I see something, I really mean me and my buddies, all traveling
the same train at the same speed, all over space taking notes on what's
happening. We'll pool our information later but we know this explosion
took place here. I'll simplify it by saying I know an explosion took
place here at location <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>So, this is our crossing. This event is when we crossed. Then, there
is a firecracker. For the firecracker, I have to give some events
[should have said "coordinates"]. I say it took place at location
<i>x</i> at time <i>t</i>. What do you say? You measure the distance
from your origin, you call this some <i>x</i> prime, the time is still
<i>t</i>. In Newtonian mechanics, the time is just the time. How many
seconds have passed is the same for everybody. The question is, "What
is the relation between <i>x</i> prime and <i>x</i>?" That's what we
want to think about. So, you guys should think before I write down the
answer. What's the relation of <i>x</i> prime to <i>x</i>? Well, this
event took place at time <i>t</i>, so I know that your origin is to the
right by an amount <i>u</i> times <i>t</i>. So, the distance from your
origin for this event, I maintain is <i>x</i> prime is <i>x - ut</i>.
Again, I want all of you to follow everything. These are all simple
notions. Our origins coincided at zero time for the event that occurs
at time <i>t</i>. Therefore, in a sense, you are rushing toward the
event. You've gone a distance <i>ut</i>. Therefore, the distance from
your origin to the event will be less than mine by this amount
<i>ut</i>. This is the law of transformation of coordinates in
Newtonian mechanics.</p>

<p>If you have an event--if you want, formally, you can define it time,
<i>t</i> prime for the primed observer. It goes without saying that
<i>t</i> prime and <i>t</i> are the same. There's no notion of time for
me and time for you. There's universal time in Newtonian mechanics. It
just runs. We can call some time a zero. Once we have agreed, if you
say you and I met at <i>t</i> = 0 and an explosion took place 5 seconds
after our meeting, it's going to be 5 seconds after our meeting for me
and it's going to be 5 seconds after the meeting for you. The time
difference between two events is the same for all people. This is
called the Galilean transformation. What are the consequences of
Galilean transformation? Well, let's look at the fact that <i>x</i>
prime is <i>x - ut</i>. Remember, everything is varying with time. So
<i>x</i> prime is a function of time and <i>x</i> is a function of
time, if you are watching a moving particle.</p>

<p>Suppose this firecracker is not just one event, but it's a moving
object. Let's give the object some speed; it's moving to the right.
Then the velocity, according to me--I'm going to call <i>v</i> as
<i>dx/dt</i> is the velocity. Let's just call it a bullet, according to
<i>S</i>. Then <i>w</i> -- it's the standard name -- is the velocity of
the bullet according to <i>S</i> prime. So, what I've done is, I first
took one event and I gave it some coordinates and I told you how to
transform the coordinate from one person to the other person. But now,
take that point <i>x</i> not to be a fixed location but a moving
object, so that as a function of time that body is moving. Then its
velocity at any time is <i>dx</i> prime <i>dt</i> according to you;
that is the <i>dx/dt</i> according to me, minus the derivative of this,
which is <i>u</i>. Now, does that make sense? This should agree with
common sense.</p>

<p>For example, if that bullet is going at 600 miles per hour to the
right, that is 600 for me, and you are going to the right in your train
at 200 miles per hour, you should measure the bullet speed to be
reduced by 200 and you should get 400. That's all it means. The two
people will disagree on the velocity of the bullet because they are
moving relative to each other. This is the way you will add velocities.
But let's look at the acceleration. <i>dw/dt</i> is going to be
<i>dv/dt</i> - 0 because <i>u</i> is a constant. That means you and I
agree on the acceleration of the body. We disagree on where it is. We
disagree on how fast the bullet's moving. But we agree on the
acceleration of the body because all I've done is add a constant
velocity to everything you see. Therefore, if according to you the
velocity of the body is not changing, according to me the velocity of
the body is not changing, because the constant added will drop out of
the difference. Or, if the body has an acceleration, we'll both get the
same answer for the acceleration. So, that is the common acceleration
<i>a</i>. So, if you like, <i>a</i>-prime is the same as <i>a</i>. So,
the acceleration of bodies doesn't change when you go from one frame of
reference to another one going at a constant speed.</p>

<p>All right, so let's look at <i>F = ma</i>, which is
<i>md<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to some force on the
body. And you look at the body and you say <i>d<sup>2</sup>x</i> prime
over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> is the force on your body. First, I want to
convince you we wanted to see that the left-hand sides are equal
because the acceleration's the same. Then, I want to convince you that
the right-hand sides are also going to be equal. I can take many
examples but eventually you will get the point. Let us not consider one
body, but let's consider two bodies. Two bodies are feeling a certain
force due to, say, gravitation. And gravitation is, of course, a force
in three dimensions but let's write the force in just one dimension.
And let's say the force of gravity is equal to 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub>
- x<sub>2</sub></i>. Force on 1 due to 2 and the force on 2 due to 1
will be minus 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub></i>. The real
forces are separation in three dimensions but this is a fictitious
force. I want to call it gravity. It is any force that depends on the
coordinates of the two particles.</p>

<p>So, I will say <i>m<sub>1</sub>d<sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> is 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub></i>.
And <i>m<sub>2</sub>d<sup>2</sup>x<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> is minus 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> minus--I
have forgotten constants like <i>g</i> and <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>. They don't matter for this purpose. So, here are
two bodies. They feel a force for each other and I've discovered what
the force is. It's 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub></i>. I don't
care if it's 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub></i> or
<i>(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup></i>; that's not
important. What's important is, it depends on <i>x<sub>1</sub> -
x<sub>2</sub></i>. You come along and you study the same two masses.
What will you say is happening? You will say,
<i>m<sub>1</sub>d<sup>2</sup>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> is equal to 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime
minus <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> prime. Maybe I will--I'm sorry. Let me do it
a little better. I can tell you what you will see. Given this is what I
see, I can tell you what you will see. Let's do that in our head. We
know that the acceleration is the same for any mass so I'm going to
write this thing as <i>m</i> of <i>dx</i> over prime
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>In other words, the acceleration according to me is the same as the
acceleration according to you. Then, I'm also going to write the
right-hand side as <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime minus
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> prime. Do you understand that? If there are two
bodies feeling a force, if you see it from a moving train, the distance
between the two bodies is the same for you and me, because
<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime is <i>x<sub>1</sub> - ut</i> and
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> prime is <i>x<sub>2</sub> - ut</i>. Take the
difference; the difference between the location of the particles is the
same for you and me. Acceleration is the same, mass is postulated to be
the same, so I know that you will get the same law that I get. You will
get <i>F = ma</i>; your acceleration will be the same as mine; the
force you attribute between the two bodies will also be the same. That
is why I know that you will also deduce the same Newtonian laws that I
will.</p>

<p>You can also say it differently. If I woke up from my nap and I am
now in a moving train and I examine the world around me, I'm going to
get the same <i>F = ma</i>. Because as seen by a person on the ground,
the masses obey <i>F = ma</i>. I am in this moving train now but I have
the same acceleration for each mass and I have the same force. So, if
you want, I'll complete the second equation.
<i>m<sub>2</sub>d<sup>2</sup> x<sub>2</sub></i> prime over
<i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> will be minus 1 over <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> prime
minus <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> prime. If this is a little difficult, we
should talk about this. I'm telling you that if I deduce <i>F = ma</i>
and the <i>F</i> depends on the separation between the particles, then
I'm sure that you will find the same laws of motion because the
acceleration is the same that I get because we have seen <i>a</i>-prime
is the same as <i>a</i>. And the force will also be the same because
the force depends on the separation between particles. And that doesn't
depend on which train you're in or it's not affected by adding a
constant velocity to the frame of reference.</p>

<p>So, if you like, this is the way you prove in Newtonian mechanics
the principle of relativity. So, not only is it something you observe
by going on trains and what not, you can actually show that this is the
reason everything looks the same. In other words, if the train was at
rest on the platform and you and I were comparing notes and we both
find <i>F = ma</i>, I go to sleep and I'm waking up and the train is
going at a constant speed, if you can look through the window and look
at the objects in my train, you will say they obey <i>F = ma</i>
because nothing has happened to you. But you will predict I will also
say <i>F = ma</i> because if you see an acceleration, I will see the
same acceleration. If you see a distance between two masses to be one
meter, I'll also think it's one meter. If the force is 1 over the
square of the distance, we'll agree on the force, we'll agree on the
acceleration, we'll agree on everything. And once you've proven <i>F =
ma</i> is valid, it follows that every mechanical phenomenon will
behave the same way. That's the reason things behave the same way.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> If for some weird reason, suppose different frames
of reference, the rule <i>F = ma</i> was to fail, what would
happen?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You mean if the rule failed in
the other frame?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Hypothetically.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. Suppose, hypothetically,
that happened. Then, it would mean that when you wake up in the train,
you will look at the world around you, it will look different because F
≠ <i>ma</i>. You will conclude, when I went to sleep it was <i>F =
ma</i>; when I got up, F ≠ <i>ma</i>, the train is moving. So, you will
have to conclude that uniform velocity makes detectable changes. And if
you look outside the train, to the other train, the other train's going
backwards. You can now no longer say, "You're going the other way, I'm
not moving", because the other person will say, "Hey, <i>F = ma</i>
works for me." It doesn't work for you. So, you're the guy who's
moving." So, you've lost the equal status with other inertial observers
because those for whom <i>F = ma</i> worked will say they're not moving
and for you, it doesn't work, so you will have to concede you are
moving. So, uniform velocity, if it makes perceptible changes, can no
longer be considered as relative. It's absolute and if you and I find
each other moving, there may be a real sense in which I am at rest and
you are moving, because for me <i>F = ma</i> works and for you it
doesn't. Well, that's not what happens.</p>

<p>In real life, you find it works for both of these and either of us
can maintain we are not moving. So now, you've got to fast forward to
about 300 years. This goes on, no problem with this principle of
relativity and 300 years later, people have discovered electricity and
magnetism and electromagnetism and electromagnetic waves, which they
identify as light. And then, it was discovered that what you and I call
light is just electric and magnetic fields traveling in space. You
don't have to know what electro-magnetic fields are right now. They are
some measurable phenomenon. They are like waves. And the waves have a
certain velocity that Maxwell calculated and that velocity is this
famous number 3 times 10 to the eight meters per second. And the
question was, "For whom is this the velocity?"</p>

<p>For example, you can do a calculation of waves on a string,
something we'll be able to do in our course. Waves on a string will be
some answer that depends on the tension on the string and the mass
density of the string and that's the velocity as seen by a person for
whom the string is at rest. But if you calculate the waves of sound in
this room -- I talk to you, you hear me slightly later -- the time it
takes to travel is the velocity of sound in this room. That is
calculated with respect to the air in this room because the waves
travel in the air. In fact, the fact that all of us are sitting on the
planet, which itself is moving at whatever, 1,100 miles per second,
doesn't matter, because the air is being carried along so even if the
Earth came to a sudden halt, as far as the velocity of sound in this
room is concerned, it won't matter, because we are carrying the medium
with us. So, people wanted to know what is the medium which carries the
waves of light, electromagnetic waves? First of all, the medium is
everywhere because--How do we know it's everywhere? Can anybody tell
me? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It travels through the vacuum of space.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right. It travels in the vacuum
of space. We can see the Sun; we can see the stars, so we know the
medium is everywhere. Then, you can sort of ask, "How dense is the
medium?" It turns out that the denser the medium, the more rapidly
signals travel, in most of the things that we know. For example, when
we look at waves in sound and when we look at sound waves in a solid,
or in iron, you find in a very dense material, that the velocity is
very high. S,o this medium, which is called "ether," would have to be
very, very dense to support waves of this incredible velocity. But
then, planets have been moving through this medium for years and years
and not slowing down. It's a very peculiar medium. But it has to be
everywhere so we are all immersed in this medium because we are able to
send light signals to different parts of the universe. And the question
is, "How fast is the Earth moving relative to this medium?" You
understand? This medium is all pervasive. We know that we can see the
stars so it's going all the way up to the stars and beyond. And we are
immersed in this and we are drifting around in space. What is our speed
relative to the medium? That's the question that was asked.</p>

<p>Well, to find the speed relative to the medium, you calculate the
velocity in the medium by Maxwell's theory. So, here's the medium in
which waves travel at a certain speed. This is planet Earth going
around the Sun. At some instant, you will have a certain velocity with
respect to ether. And therefore, the velocity of light as seen by you
will be modified from <i>c</i> to <i>c - V</i>. In particular, suppose
the waves are traveling to the right in ether. Let me draw it this way.
The Earth is going at this instant at the speed <i>V</i>. We expect the
speed to be <i>c - V</i> because part of the speed is neutralized
because you are going along with the waves. You'll see a slower
velocity. So, Mr. Michelson and his assistant Morley--they did the
experiment. And they got the answer equal to <i>c</i>. What does that
mean?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The speed of light [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, no, but you cannot jump to
that right now. If you are following Newtonian physics, your
expectation is, it should be <i>c - V</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It means that there is no ether.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, that's--not so fast, but
it certainly means the following. Well, there's a simpler answer than
that. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It means that the Earth is moving with respect to
the ether.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> At what speed?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Zero.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Zero. Because you don't have
to--Look, you guys are ready to overthrow everything because you know
the answer. But you've got to put yourself in the place of somebody in
the early 1900s. There's no reason to overthrow anything. The answer
is, you're going at the speed zero. Of course, you realize, that it is
incredibly fortunate that on the one day Michelson wants to do the
experiment, we happen to be at rest with respect to the ether. Fine.
But we know that luck is not going to last forever because you are
going around the Sun. On a particular day may be. But that velocity was
such that on that day the Earth was at rest with respect to the ether.
It's clear that six months later, when we are going the other
direction, you cannot also be at rest with respect to the ether. But
that's what you find when you do the experiment. You find every day you
get the same answer and you jolly well know you are not at rest. You
are moving around the Sun for sure. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Did they postulate a drag for the Earth turning
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. So, people tried other
solutions. But it is simply a fact that when you move one way or six
months later in the opposite way, you get the same answer <i>c</i>. So,
one possibility is, you don't want--Look, don't be ready to do
revolutions, try to avoid it. So, one answer is, look at the speed of
sound. You and I talked to each other then and we talked to each other
six months from now; we get the same speed of sound. The speed of sound
is published in textbooks, right? Seven hundred and something miles per
hour. How come that doesn't change from day to day? Anybody here on
this side can tell me why the speed of sound doesn't change from day to
day even though we are moving? No one here can guess?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, we are moving. Even six
months from now, we get the same speed of sound in this room. When I
talk to you, does it matter what time of year it is?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The medium is moving along with us?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes, we are carrying air. As the
Earth moves through space, it carries the air with you and the speed of
the wave is with respect to the medium. If you can carry the medium
with you, then it doesn't matter how fast you're moving. So, they tried
that. They tried to argue that the Earth carries ether with it the way
it carries air with it. Then, it's not an accident you are at rest with
respect to the ether because you're taking it with you. But it's very
easy to show by looking at distant stars that you cannot be doing that.
I don't have time to tell you why that is true. So, you cannot take the
ether with you and you cannot leave it behind, and that's the impasse
people were in. So, it's as if there's a car that's going to the right
at a certain speed <i>c</i>. You move to the right at some speed, maybe
<i>c</i>/2. I expect you to get a speed <i>c</i>/2. But you keep
getting <i>c</i>. You go three fourths of the velocity of light; you
still get the velocity of light. That is very contrary to what we
believe. In fact, that's in violent opposition to this law here. If
this <i>V</i> were not a bullet but a light beam, suppose for me
traveling at a speed <i>c</i> and you're traveling to the right at
speed <i>u</i>, you should get <i>c - u</i>. That's the inevitable
consequence of Newtonian physics. And you don't get that. And that was
a big problem.</p>

<p>So, people tried to fix it up by doing different models of ether,
none of which worked. And nobody knew why light is behaving in this
peculiar fashion, so that's when Einstein came in and said, "I know why
light is behaving in this peculiar fashion. It is behaving in this way
because if it didn't behave in this way, if the speed of light depended
on how fast I'm moving, then when I wake up in this train, all I have
to do is measure the speed of light. Originally, I got some number; now
I get to get a different number and the difference will give me the
speed of the train. So, it would have been possible to detect the
velocity of the train without looking outside, just by doing an
experiment with light. So, even though mechanical laws involving <i>F =
ma</i> are the same, laws of electricity and magnetism would be such
that somehow they would betray your velocity. And that would mean
uniform velocity does make an observable change because it changes the
velocity of light that you would measure. "</p>

<p>But conversely, the fact that you keep getting the same answer means
that electric and magnetic phenomena are part of the conspiracy to hide
your velocity. Just like mechanical phenomena won't tell you how fast
you're moving, neither will electromagnetic phenomena. Because to
Einstein, it was very obvious that nature would not design a system in
which mechanical laws are the same but laws of electricity are
different. So, he postulated that all phenomena, whatever be their
nature, will be unaffected by going to a frame at constant velocity
relative to the initial one. That's a very brave postulate because it
even applies to biological phenomena about which I'm sure Einstein knew
very little. But he believed that natural phenomena will just follow
either the principle of relativity or they won't. And that is something
you should think about. Because that was the only reason he had. He
just said, "I don't believe chapters 1 through 10 in our book obey
relativity and chapters 20 through 30 where we do E&amp;M doesn't."
These are all natural phenomena that will obey the same principle,
which says all observers that are uniform relative to motion are
equivalent.</p>

<p>Now, that's really based on a lot of faith and even though
scientists generally are opposed to intelligent design, we all have
some bias about the way natural laws were designed; there's no question
about it. You can talk to any practicing physicist. We have a faith
that underlying laws of nature will have a certain elegance and a
certain beauty and a certain uniformity across all of natural
phenomena. That is a faith that we have. It's not a religious issue;
otherwise, I wouldn't bring it up in the classroom, but it is certainly
the credo of all scientists, at least all physicists, that there is
some elegance in the laws of nature and we put a lot of money on that
faith, that the laws of nature will do this and will not do this. Who
are we to say that? Who are we to say nature wouldn't have a system in
which mechanics obeys the laws but electricity and magnetism doesn't?
We haven't run into somebody called nature. We don't worship a certain
deity called nature but we believe the laws of nature obey that. So,
even though scientists or physicists in particular may not believe in
design by any personal God, they do believe in this underlying,
rational system that we are trying to uncover. You could be disproven,
you could be wrong in making the assumption, but here it was right. It
was really driven by this notion that all laws of physics should obey
the same principle of relativity. So, Einstein's postulates are that
light behaves in this way because if it didn't behave in this way, it
would violate the principle of relativity, whereas we know mechanical
phenomena do and electrical phenomena would not and that cannot be the
case. You have a question?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why would that not apply to the speed of sound?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. Because in the case of the
speed of sound, you can take the medium with you; there is no such
experiment you could perform. See, in the train, if you could carry the
ether with you, there's no surprise you would get the same answer. But
we know we cannot carry the medium with us, that comes from
extra-terrestrial experiments. That's why the velocity of sound is not
elevated to a fundamental velocity on which everybody will agree. So,
the two great postulates--You've got to know where the postulates come
from.</p>

<p>Postulate Number 1 is simply a restatement of the relativity
principle. I'll just say it in one sentence. Exact wording is not
important. All inertial observers are equivalent. "Equivalent" means
each one of them is as privileged as any other one to discover the laws
of nature. The laws of nature, we found, are not an accident related to
our state of motion. If I find some laws, and you're moving relative to
me, you'll find the same laws. And if you and I find each other in
relative motion, you have as much right to claim you are at rest and I
am moving and I have as much right to claim that I am at rest and you
are moving. There is complete symmetry between observers in uniform
relative motion. There is no symmetry between people in non-uniform
[relative] motion. As I said, non-uniform motion creates effects which
can destroy me and not destroy you. So, no one's trying to talk their
way out of acceleration, whereas you can talk your way out of uniform
velocity. That's the first principle. So this was there even from the
time of Newton. What is true here is that all inertial observers are
equivalent with respect to all natural phenomena, meaning all natural
laws. And that is a generalization, when we say "all" instead of just
mechanical. And the Second Postulate, you call it a postulate because
there is just no way to deduce this, is that the velocity of light is
independent of the state of motion of the source, of the observer, of
everything. If a light beam is emitted by a moving rocket, it doesn't
matter. If a light beam is seen in a moving rocket, it doesn't matter.
All people will get the same answer for the velocity of light.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is there a reason why the speed of light is
constant?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. That's why it is a
postulate. You can show a few things later on. You can show that if
there is any other speed, which is the same for everybody, that would
have to be the speed of light. In the final theory of relativity, there
are not two or three velocities that come out the same for everybody.
There is only one velocity that can have the same answer for all
people. That velocity is the velocity of light. By that I don't mean it
has to be light itself. For example, gravitational waves travel at the
speed of light. It's not just the light. It has to do with the velocity
of light being a single number which has to have the same value for
everybody.</p>

<p>Okay, so it looks like he has solved a big problem because he has
said why light behaves this way; light behaves this way because it is
part of the big conspiracy to hide uniform motion. But you will see
that you have made a terrible bargain because once you take these two
postulates, you have restored the relativity principle to all
phenomena. Okay. You've gone beyond mechanical phenomena to
electro-magnetic phenomena.</p>

<p>But you will find that you have to give up all the other cherished
notions of Newtonian physics. Think about why. We are saying, here is a
car going at 200 miles an hour, according to me. You get into your own
car and follow that car at 50 miles an hour. You should get 150 but you
keep getting 200. This may not be true for cars going at the speeds I
mentioned but when finally you are talking about a pulse of light, that
is true. And you've got to agree that is really not compatible with our
daily notions or with the formula I wrote down, <i>w = v - u</i>. When
you put <i>v = c</i>, <i>w</i> has got to come out to be <i>c</i>. And
that's not a property of the Newtonian transformation. So, what we are
looking for is a new rule for connecting <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> and
<i>x</i> prime and <i>t</i> prime, such that when the velocities are
computed and applied to the velocity of light, you get the same answer.
That's what we want to do now.</p>

<p>So, here is how we are going to do this. Now, let's think about it.
Let me send a pulse to the right at speed <i>c</i>. You are going to
the right at three-fourths of <i>c</i>. My Newtonian expectation is,
you should get the speed of the pulse to be one-fourth of <i>c</i>. But
you insist it is <i>c</i>. So, what will I say to you? What will I
accuse you of doing? I say you should get <i>c</i>/4 and you're getting
<i>c</i>. And you're finding velocity by finding the distance it
travels and dividing by the time so you are jacking up a number like
one-fourth <i>c</i> to <i>c</i> itself. So, what could make you do
that? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> If I perceive that you're moving forward, or you're
contracting your length, then you're going to measure velocity keeping
in mind you should have had a greater length to begin with.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes. So, one option--Let me
repeat what he said. I will say your meter sticks are being somehow
shorter. When you and I were buddies and were on the same train, we
agreed on the meter stick. But now we have gone on the moving train. I
will say there is something wrong with your meter stick. Not only
something wrong. Specifically, I would say your meter sticks have
shrunk. For example, if they have shrunk to one-fourth their size, it
is very clear that you would get a velocity of four times what I
expect. But there's another possibility.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Time may be running slow.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Your clocks may be running slow.
So, you let the light travel for four seconds and you thought it was
only one second. That's why you got four times the answer; or it could
be both. But something has to give. And that is why it is an amazing
theory. That's why it is also amazing to me that somebody who was 26
years old would simply follow the consequence of this theory and take
it wherever it takes you but it is at the very foundations of space and
time that you have to modify. So, even though you restored the
relativity principle and brought it back to the front, the price you
have to pay is to give up your notions that length is length and time
is time. We used to think a meter stick is a meter stick and a clock is
a clock. If I have a clock that ticks out one second, you take it on a
train, I expect it to be ticking one second, but we're saying it's not.
So, something has to give in length measurement or time measurement or
both. And that's what we're going to find out.</p>

<p>So, here's how you find that out. Let us say that--Maybe I'll do it
all on one blackboard because this is the key to the whole calculation.
You remember now, if there is an event here, you call it <i>x</i> prime
and I call it <i>x</i>. And according to me, you have traveled the
distance <i>ut</i>. So, <i>x</i> prime equals <i>x - ut</i> is what we
used to say in the old days. And the converse of that is <i>x = x</i>
prime + <i>ut</i>. But now, we'll admit the fact that maybe <i>t</i>
and <i>t</i> prime are no longer the same. But that's not all we will
do. I will say, whenever you give me a length <i>x</i> prime, I just
don't buy it. I take any length you give me and I jack it up by a
factor of <i>γ</i> [correction: should have said 1/<i>γ</i>] to get the
length according to me. And you will take any answer I give you and you
will multiply it by the same factor.</p>

<p>[Note: The preceding discussion and a similar one later on are
poorly worded and unclear. The point is simply this: In the old
Newtonian days, I would have said you should get for the coordinate of
the event <i>x' = x - ut</i> but now I will multiply this expectation
by a factor <i>γ</i> because your meter sticks could differ from mine.
It is not known yet if your meter sticks are shorter or longer
according to me. The fact that ultimately <i>γ &gt;1</i>, means your
meter sticks are shortened according to me. (A person with a shortened
meter stick will assign a numerically larger value to a length.)
Strangely, it will also mean my meter sticks are shortened according to
you. Don't worry about this yet!]</p>

<p>In other words, we don't buy our units of length, so if you say it
should be <i>x</i> prime + <i>ut</i> prime, that's your formula
backwards for me. The coordinate of the event, according to you, in the
old days, was <i>x</i> prime + <i>ut</i>. Now, we admit that <i>t</i>
and <i>t</i> prime may not be the same. Then we say, but I will not
take your lengths, I will multiply them by <i>γ</i> to get the lengths
according to me. And you will not take my expectations, but you will
multiply it by the same <i>γ</i>; that is the symmetry between the two
observers. In other words, if I think your meter sticks are short and
<i>γ</i> [correction: should have said 1/<i>γ</i>] is a number less
than 1, I'm allowing you to accuse me of having meter sticks which are
short. It is very interesting. If I said your meter sticks are short
and you say my meter sticks are longer than average, that's an absolute
difference. But we both accuse each other of using shortened meter
sticks, and so we use the same factor of <i>γ</i>. We are going to find
this <i>γ</i> now.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How do you know that both the distance and time are
different?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> We'll give it the possibility
that they are different and then we will see that they are different.
We know something's wrong with space and something's wrong with time.
So, we'll not assume that <i>t</i> prime is equal to <i>t</i>. You have
to open up the possibility. In the end, it may be that the nature will
say <i>t</i> prime is <i>t</i> and something happens to length alone.
But we'll find the answer is more symmetric.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Why do we say that the symmetry is the same?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: Because that is the symmetry
between the two observers. If I want to say your meter sticks are
short, why should you concede that? You should be able to accuse me of
saying--The only difference between you and me is you are moving to the
right and I'm moving to the left. Other than the sign of the velocity,
each person says the other person is moving and so we will say that any
length you give I'll discount by a factor of <i>γ</i>. By symmetry,
anything I call a length, you will discount by the same factor of
<i>γ</i>.</p>

<p>Now, let's apply this. (<i>x</i>,<i>t</i>) was a certain event,
right? Let's apply it to the following event. You have to follow this
very carefully. When you and I crossed, remember that was at the origin
of coordinates, <i>x</i> equals to <i>t</i> equals to zero and <i>x</i>
prime equals to <i>t</i> prime equals to zero. At that instant when our
origins touched, let us emit a flash of light. Okay, maybe when the
origins touched, there's a spark, the light signal goes out and the
light signal is detected here, by a light detector. That second event,
detection of the pulse, it has a coordinates (<i>x</i>,<i>t</i>) for
me; it has a coordinates (<i>x</i> prime, <i>t</i> prime) for you. The
same event is given different coordinates. We've already used the fact
that coordinates will be different but we are saying not only will
<i>x</i> prime not be equal to <i>x</i>; <i>t</i> prime may not be
equal to <i>t</i> either. Okay, but now let's write down one important
condition. What is the relation between <i>x</i> prime and <i>t</i>
prime in this particular pair of events? What is <i>x</i> prime? It is
the location of the light pulse after certain time? So, what's the
relation of the location of the detection of the light pulse and the
time <i>t</i> prime? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar</b>: He is saying <i>x</i> prime--Do
you guys understand that? Do you agree with that statement? This is not
a random event. The second event was the detection of a light pulse.
Light pulse left the origin <i>t</i> prime seconds earlier and has come
to this point, according to this guy, and the ratio of the distance to
the time is the velocity of light. But it is also true that for me, the
light went to distance <i>x</i> in a time <i>t</i>. So, that's the
relation of <i>x</i> to <i>t</i> for me also. I'm going to use those
two results and combine it with this to find this factor <i>γ</i> and
we will do that now. I want you to multiply the left-hand side by the
left-hand side and the right-hand side by the right-hand side of that
equation.</p>

<p>I hope you understand that in the Galilean days, in the old
days--Let's see what you will say. I will say, <i>x</i> prime is <i>x -
ut</i> because the origins have shifted by an amount <i>ut</i>. And you
will say <i>x</i> is <i>x</i> prime plus <i>ut</i> with the same time.
Now, I'm saying time is different. Not only that, I don't buy your
length. If you expect me to have this length, I say "no." You
exaggerated everything. I'll scale it down by <i>γ</i> and vice versa.
So, if you multiply the left-hand side by the left-hand side, you get
<i>xx</i> prime, the right-hand side you get <i>γ<sup>2</sup></i> times
<i>xx</i> prime plus <i>uxt</i> prime minus <i>ux</i> prime <i>t</i>
minus <i>u<sup>2</sup>tt</i> prime. Now, divide everything by <i>xx</i>
prime. Then, you get 1 = <i>γ<sup>2</sup></i> times 1 + <i>u</i>. If
you divide this by <i>xx</i> prime, you'll get <i>t</i> prime over
<i>x</i> prime. If you divide this by <i>xx</i> prime, you'll get
<i>t/x</i>. And here you get <i>u<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>t/x</i>,
times <i>t</i> prime over <i>x</i> prime.</p>

<p>So, what does that mean? Well, <i>t</i> prime over <i>x</i> prime is
1/<i>c</i> and <i>t</i>/<i>x</i> is also 1/<i>c</i> because of what I
wrote here. If you want, let me write this as <i>t</i> prime over
<i>x</i> prime equals the <i>c</i> and <i>t</i> over <i>x</i> equals
the <i>c</i>. So, they will cancel. And I'll get 1 =
<i>γ<sup>2</sup></i> times 1 - <i>u<sup>2</sup></i> over
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> because this t<i>/x</i> is a 1/<i>c</i> and
<i>t</i> prime over <i>x</i> prime is another 1/<i>c</i>. So, that
gives us the result that <i>γ</i> is 1 over square root of 1 -
<i>u<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. If you plug the
<i>γ</i> back in, you will find <i>x</i> prime is <i>x - ut</i> divided
by [square root of] 1 - <i>u<sup>2</sup></i> over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>.
Now, once you do that, once you got the relation between <i>x</i> prime
and <i>x</i>, you can go to the lower equation and solve for <i>t</i>
prime. I don't feel like doing that. It's a simple algebraic equation
once you've got <i>x</i> prime how to solve for <i>t</i> prime. Take
the second of the two equations and solve for <i>t</i> prime. That
detail I won't fill out, but you will get <i>t</i> prime is <i>t -
ux</i> over <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> divided by this. So, I've not done
every step but I've given you all the things you need to do the one
step. There are equations up there that relate <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>
prime to <i>t</i> and <i>t</i> prime so if you can get <i>x</i> prime
in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>, the other equation that you solve
will give you <i>t</i> prime in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. And
this is the result. Okay. This guy deserves two boxes because it is the
greatest result from relativity; it's called the Lorentz
transformation. And we've been able to derive the Lorentz
transformation with what little we know. And you can see, you can be a
kid in high school and you can do this. There's no calculus or anything
else involved, other than being open to the fact that the velocity of
light behaves in this strange way. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How do you get <i>t/x = c</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Why is <i>t/x = c</i>? Oh, of
course, you're quite right. So, you caught the mistake here. <i>t/x</i>
is 1 over <i>c</i> and 1/<i>c</i>. I really meant to write <i>x =
ct</i>. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. If you define <i>γ</i> to be
the absolute value by which you transfer lengths from you to me, then
you can take the positive root.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, I can also tell you other
reasons. Let's take this formula here. Let's take the case where the
velocity is very small compared to the velocity of light. That
<i>u/c</i> is a very small number. This number is almost 1 and I get
<i>x</i> prime because <i>x - ut</i>, which I know to be the correct
answer at lower velocities. If you pick the minus sign, I'll get minus
of <i>x - ut</i>, that's not the right answer, not even close to the
right answer. At low velocities, if you go to velocity <i>u</i> over
<i>c</i> much less than 1, you have got to get back to Galilean
transformation. You can see if <i>u</i> over <i>c</i> goes to zero. You
can forget all about this factor here. You get <i>x</i> prime is
<i>x</i> <i>- ut</i> and here, <i>u</i> over <i>c</i> can be neglected,
forget all that, you get <i>t</i> prime equals <i>t</i>. So, this
coordinate transformation would reduce to the Galilean transformation
if the velocity between me and you is much smaller than the velocity of
light. So, the formula really kicks in for velocities comparable to
velocity of light. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] What happens if <i>u &gt; c</i>?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, you start getting crazy
answers, right? You can already see that the theory will not admit
velocities bigger than the velocity of light. You can already see it in
this formula. That tells you that the one single velocity that you
wanted to be the same for everybody is also the greatest possible
velocity; that no observer can move at this speed with respect to
another observer that is equal to what is in excess of the speed of
light. So, the speed of light, which came out to be a constant in the
beginning of the theory, is also turning out to be the upper limit on
possible velocities. That's the origin of the statement that no
observer can travel at a speed bigger than light, but we'll discuss it
more and more. But you have to understand what it is that is being
derived, what is the meaning of this formula here. What is it telling
you? If I say, this is called the Lorenz transformations, what do they
tell you? What are these numbers and what's their significance? Would
you like to try?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Well, one thing that they tell you is if <i>u</i>
happens to be greater than <i>c</i> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No, no, I don't mean what
happens in the formula in special cases. What is it relating? What is
<i>xt</i> and what is <i>x</i> prime <i>t</i> prime?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Okay, so <i>x</i> prime would be the distance that
the person who's traveling at the higher speed experiences. And
[inaudible] and so for that person, distance is going to seem
shorter?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. See, I'm not even telling
you to get consequences of the equation. What are the numbers <i>x</i>
and <i>t</i> in this equation? And what are the numbers <i>x</i> prime
and <i>t</i> prime in this equation?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> are distance and time for a
person who is in an inertial frame of reference, who is not moving.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> And <i>x</i> prime and <i>t</i> prime are distance
and time for the person who is moving at the speed of [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> And when you say distance and
time, what do you mean, distance and time?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The way that the length of the distance will seem to
them that they travel.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> But what is happening at
<i>xt</i>; it's the coordinates of what?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Of their location [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> They are located at zero, zero.
Right? What's happening at <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's observing the event.</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> It's the event. The key I was
looking for is an event. You've got to understand what the formula is
connecting. Things are happening in space and in time, right? Something
happens here. That something has a spatial coordinate and a time
coordinate, according to two observers. The observers originally had
their origins and their clocks coincide when they passed; that's how
they're related. And one is moving to the right at speed <i>u</i>.
Then, the claim is that if one event had a coordinate <i>x</i> and
<i>t</i> for one person, for the other person moving to the right at
speed <i>u</i>, the same event would have coordinates <i>x</i> prime
and <i>t</i> prime and the relation between <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> and
<i>x</i> prime and <i>t</i> prime is this. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The two observers [inaudible] don't they observe
different laws and [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> No. The fact that an event has
different coordinates doesn't mean that you are observing different
laws. For example, let's take that fire extinguisher. We look at it,
it's obeying <i>F = ma</i>, right? The coordinates of the fire
extinguisher with me as the origin is quite different from you as the
origin.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> You mean in these new equations?
Yes, in these new equations, <i>F = ma</i> will not work; that's
correct.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> They are inertial references, even though they are
moving?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah. Yes. So, the point is the
laws of Newton themselves have to be modified. <i>F = ma</i> will be
modified in a certain way but the new modified laws will reduce to <i>F
= ma</i> at low velocities, which is why in the old days it looked like
<i>F = ma</i>. But there will be new laws, but they will also have the
property that when I measure them I'll get the laws that will agree
with what you measure. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Does individual values for time or distance still
have to agree?</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> The coordinates of an event will
differ from person to person. That's not the same as saying the laws as
deduced will be different. For example, there are two stars which are
attracted to each other by gravitation and they are orbiting around
their common center of mass. If I see them, I will find that they obey
the law of gravitation with <i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>r<sup>2</sup></i> where <i>r</i> is the distance between the points
and the acceleration is whatever I think it is. You can go on a rocket
and look at the same two stars. They will be in a more complicated
motion, maybe the whole system will be drifting a little to you, but
their acceleration will be the same as what I get and the force between
them will also be the same as what I get and the laws that you would
deduce by looking at that star would be the same laws that I would
deduce. So, that's a difference between the laws being the same and the
coordinates being the same.</p>

<p>No one said <i>x</i> prime and <i>x</i> are the same in that
equation there. They are different. We are looking at it from different
vantage points. But the fact is that force is equal to mass times
acceleration is the same for the two people. Okay. The laws will be the
same but things won't look the same. For example, you can stand on your
head, don't even have to go to another frame of reference; you can
stand on your head, your <i>z</i> coordinate is the minus of my
<i>z</i> coordinate; to every point I give a <i>z</i>, you will give a
minus <i>z</i>. But the world, even though you are a little messed up
and want to stand on your head, you have every right to do that and you
will find that <i>F = ma</i>. So the point is, the way we see events
may depend on their origin or coordinates, but the laws we deduce are
to be distinguished from the perception that we have. Okay? For
example, if I'm on the ground, I send a piece of chalk, it goes up and
it goes down. If you see me from a moving train, you would think it
went on a parabola. So, no one says the chalk will go up and down for
you. For you, it will go like this but its motion will still obey <i>F
= ma</i>, is what I'm saying. That's all you really mean by saying
things look the same.</p>

<p>So, what you have to understand is that Lorentz transformations are
the way to relate a pair of events, given events. Here's a simple
example. If you live in the <i>xy</i> plane, there's a point here. It's
not an event, it's simply a point in the <i>xy</i> plane. You measure
it this way and that way and you call it the coordinates. If somebody
else picks a different coordinate system with an angle <i>θ</i>, that
person will say that's <i>x</i> prime and that is <i>y</i> prime and
<i>x</i> prime and <i>y</i> prime are not the same. I remind you,
<i>x</i> prime is <i>x cos&gt; θ</i> [delete "minus <i>y</i>"] plus
<i>y sin θ</i>, etc., and <i>y</i> prime is something else. <i>θ</i> is
the angle between the two observers. So, the point is the point. It
certainly looks different to the two people, but the same point has two
coordinates. Similarly, the same event, like the collision of two cars,
will have different events for different people. That's not the new
part. The new part is that the rules for connecting <i>xt</i> to
<i>x't'</i>, is quite different from the Galilean rules, new rules.
It's what you guys have to understand.</p>

<p>And finally, why did Einstein get the credit for turning the world
into four dimensions instead of three? After all, <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>
were present there, too. The point is, <i>t</i> prime is always equal
to <i>t</i> no matter how you move, whereas in the Einstein theory,
<i>x</i> and <i>t</i> get scrambled into <i>x</i> prime and <i>t</i>
prime just the way <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> get scrambled into each other
when you rotate your axis. So, to have time as another variable that
doesn't transform at all is not the same as making it into a
coordinate. The four-dimensional world of Einstein is four-dimensional
because space and time mix with each other when you change your frame
of reference. That's what makes <i>t</i> now a coordinate as previously
it was something the same for all people. All right, I'll see your guys
on Wednesday.</p>
