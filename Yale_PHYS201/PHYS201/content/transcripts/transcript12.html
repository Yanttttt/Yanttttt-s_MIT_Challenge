<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Okay, I left you guys thinking about inductors last time, so I should start
there. An inductor is very different from the resistor when you start doing
circuit theory, because when you have a resistor and you connect some voltage
to it, the current is determined by this equation. This is what I call an
algebraic equation. It's an equation in algebra, one unknown. You solve for
it by dividing and you get <i>I </i>at time <i>t</i> is <i>V</i> at time <i>t</i>
divided by <i>R</i>. And you can make the network more complicated, put a few
more resistors, put a few more there, a few more here, resistors within
resistors. It doesn't matter, because we can always in the end combine the
ones in series then lump them with the stuff in parallel, till the whole thing
to the right of this is one single effective resistor. Then you find the
current coming out of the sources as <i>V</i> divided by that guy. Then every
time it comes to a branch, we sort of know how to divide it. </p>
<p>So resistor circuits
are very easy. But now when you bring inductors, things are different, so I'm
just going to tell you a little more about them. Here is an inductor. That's
the symbol for an inductor. It's got some inductance <i>L</i> measured in
henries. And the implication of that is the following: if you have a current
going through this inductor, there is going to be necessarily a voltage with
this polarity if the current is increasing. And the voltage you need is <i>LdI/dt</i>.
This is the bottom line. Even if you skip all the other stuff about
conservative forces, this, that, this is something you need to know how to do
problems. The difference you notice is that the relation between voltage and
current is not an algebraic equation, but a differential equation. This is
called a differential equation. Now you don't have to worry, because I will
tell you how to solve it, because I don't know if it's a prerequisite or not
for this course. I once had a kid in summer school who when I started using
partial derivatives, got very upset and said, &quot;It's not a prerequisite.
Why are you using partial derivatives?&quot; So I told him, &quot;When you
come to class, there's always a danger you'll learn something new. You just
have to learn to live with that.&quot; So I'm not going to leave you in the
cold. If I do something you've not done, I will tell you how to do it, but I
cannot avoid using certain notions. </p>
<p>So this one, even
though it's called a differential equation and so on, if <i>V</i> is a
constant, we can easily find the integral. It will be <i>V</i> over <i>L</i>
times <i>t</i>. Okay, but now we're going to be interested in cases where <i>V</i>
is not simply constant; it could be varying with time in an arbitrary way. So
you take this guy, the first thing you notice is that the relation between
current and voltage is given by derivatives. Second thing is, when a current
flows through a resistor, whatever energy you provide is gone in the form of
heat. It has dissipated. The light bulb glows and that's the end. With an inductor,
when you drive a current, you are building a magnetic field inside the inductor
and there's an energy associated with the magnetic field. And that stored
energy will be given back to you later on. So it's like a capacitor. It takes
a lot of work to charge a capacitor, because you've got to take charges from
this plate and keep on piling them in that plate. It's a lot of work, but
then if you connect that to a bulb and you squeeze the trigger in your camera,
this charge is giving you the energy back. So the inductor and capacitor are
different from the resistor in two ways: one is, the voltage across the
capacitor is the charge on the capacitor divided by <i>C</i>, which if youlike
is the integral of the current up to that time divided by <i>C</i>. Again, calculus
comes in. So these are the two differences, the relation between current and
voltage and voltage is differentiating or integrating, and these are energy
storing circuit elements compared to this one, where energy is dissipated. </p>
<p>So let's start with a
simple problem where I have a voltage source. I'm going to take a fixed
voltage, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>. There is a switch, there is a resistor <i>R</i>,
and there is this inductor <i>L</i>. I'm going to assume the current is
flowing this way, in which case--I'm sorry. You know, this picture's wrong.
What's wrong with this picture? What is wrong?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The switch is
open.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The switch is open, okay. That's what's wrong, so nothing is flowing yet. But
when I close the switch, then it's fine. Now it's flowing. And the question
is, what does it do? How does it flow? After all, the inductor is a
resistance free wire, so you may think current = <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R</i> will
start flowing immediately, but that's wrong, because if such a current were
flowing, there'll be an energy &frac12;<i>LI<sup>2</sup></i> with that current in it.
And that energy cannot come from 0 to all of that in no time. There's no way
to do that. Or if you like, if the current really grows rapidly or
instantaneously from 0 to some value, that's a current, <i>dI/dt</i> is infinite
here. <i>dI/dt</i> is infinite,<i> LdI/dt</i> is infinite. There's an
infinite voltage needed somewhere in the circuit and we don't have it, so that
would not happen. So current will have to be continuous, start from 0 and it
will have to start climbing. The minute the current starts climbing up it
starts flowing through this guy. There is the resistance times current voltage
drop across this. </p>
<p>Therefore the amount
of voltage available to drive current through this one or to increase the
current through this one is reduced from <i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>to <i>V<sub>0</sub>
- RI</i>. That = <i>LdI/dt</i>. So you can see, as the current increases, the
motivation to increase the current decreases, because this resistor starts
swallowing up more and more of this voltage. So the growth in current will be
very, very slow, and we expect that after a very long time, it will settle down
to some value. What is that value? We can find that value by saying,
&quot;Wait until the current has stopped growing.&quot; That means <i>dI/dt </i>=0,
that current will be <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/<i>R</i> and I'm going to give it the
name <i>I<sub>infinity</sub></i>, because it will turn out that you will reach
the value only after infinite time. But you can get very, very close to that
by waiting some reasonable amount of time, and part of what we want to do is,
how long should I wait? Suppose I'm settling for 90 percent of maximum. When
does that happen? Is it after 1 second or 10 seconds or 10 hours? What's
going to decide that? </p>
<p>Well, once you have
the right equations, you can figure everything out. So we're going to do
that. So basically we are going to solve the equation <i>LdI/dt</i>. So let me
show you one more time how it is done, this equation. You should know how to
write it. Start anywhere you like, go round this guy. You gain voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.
Then go around this guy, you drop by an amount <i>RI</i>. You drop by an
amount <i>RI</i>. And here you jump from this end to this end. Remember, you
never go into the inductor. That's a bad zone. That's a zone where the
potential is not even defined, but I've told you multiple times that even
though there are non conservative things going on inside this, once you come
outside, you just find a regular electrostatic potential difference = <i>LdI/dt</i>.
So you drop again, and you come back to where you start, the whole thing should
add up to 0, which means the equation is <i>LdI/dt + RI = V<sub>0</sub></i>.
That's what we want to solve. </p>
<p>So when you have this
thing, as I told you, solving differential equations is a matter of guess
work. There is no algorithm. You rely on what you've seen before and you
guess the answer. You put some free parameters, you fiddle with them till
everything works. And in this kind of problem, we can make everything work.
Some problems we cannot solve. We can write the equations but we cannot solve
them. This is something you're not used to when you take an elementary course
like this one. But there are situations, for example, you know inside the
proton there are these quarks, and the quarks interact with each other with
entities called gluons. They're called gluons because they glue the quarks and
form the protons and neutrons. We know the equations governing the behavior of
the gluons. We cannot solve them. It's really strange. You have an equation
but you cannot solve it. It's completely possible, because certain
equations--every equation has a solution, but it does not mean you can write it
down analytically. So quite often, one may be on top of the right answer, but
one may not know how to solve it, so one doesn't even know if the theory is
right. </p>
<p>So suppose this was
the equation you got, but you could not solve it. It happens to be the right
equation. You don't know what the answer looks like, you can never be sure
this is the right equation. Similarly when Mr. Schr√∂dinger invented his
quantum mechanics, he wrote an equation that will tell you the energy levels of
hydrogen. But luckily, he was able to solve it. By solving it, he was able to
show that his equation gives the energy levels iand the spectra you expect from
the hydrogen atom. So you have to remember that not every interesting equation
can be solved, and I gave you the equation for these gluons, which we can write
down but cannot solve. There is no function whose derivative we cannot take.
There are lots of functions whose integrals we cannot do. That's simply asymmetry
between those two. Here's a very simple function: <i>e<sup>&#8722;x2</sup>dx</i>
from 0 to 19, or some fixed number, 0 to some <i>x<sub>max</sub></i>. It has a
definite value. It's area under the graph, but no one knows how to write a
formula for this in terms of <i>x<sub>max</sub></i>, where it's in closed
form. </p>
<p>But anyway, this guy
we can trample to death as follows. First we say at very, very long times, the
current, I told you, is <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R</i>. That's when<i> dI/dt </i>is
0. So we're going to write the actual current in our problem as the current at
infinity + some difference I twiddle. Standard thing, you take out the part
you know and solve for the rest of it. So let's take that assumed form and put
it into the differential equation. So when I do <i>LdI/dt</i>, this is a
number, <i>V </i>over <i>R</i>. It has no d by dt. So <i>dI/dt</i> becomes <i>dI&#732;/dt</i>
+ <i>R</i> times <i>I&#732;</i> + <i>R</i> times <i>I<sub>infinity</sub></i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.
Now you can see why we did that. We did that because now these two guys cancel
and you get <i>LdI/dt </i>+ <i>RI</i> = 0. That means <i>dI&#732;/dt</i> is &#8722;<i>R/L </i>times
<i>I</i>. So we are saying, get me a function whose time derivative looks like
the function itself up to a constant, and that's something we know from high
school, is an exponential function. So <i>I&#732; </i>looks like some constant, <i>I<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-Rt/L</sup></i>.
You can take the derivative of this guy and out will come <i>-R/L </i>times the
function itself. And <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub> </i>is completely arbitrary. It's not
determined by this equation. There's another useful property to know. </p>
<p>This is a linear
equation. It means if you multiply both sides by 19, you get another solution
which is 19 times the old solution. So the solution's overall scale is not
determined by the equation. If I give you one solution, you can multiply it by
any number you like, it's also a solution, because if you multiply by a number,
say 9, the 9 goes into the derivative, 9 comes here. You can see 9 times <i>I&#732; </i>satisfies
the same equation. So we don&#39;t know this number just from the equation, but we
go back to what we know, which is <i>I </i>of <i>t</i>, is <i>I<sub>infinity</sub></i>,
which is <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R </i>+ <i>I&#732;<sub>0</sub>e<sup>&#8722;Rt/L</sup></i>. But I
know that at <i>t </i>= 0, this guy should vanish. <i>t </i>= 0, this guy
should vanish, because there was no current when I just threw the switch. So
that tells me that equals 0. That tells me<i> I&#732;<sub>0</sub> </i>= <i>-V<sub>0</sub>/R
</i>and we get our final result, which is <i>I</i> of <i>t</i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R
</i>times 1 - <i>e<sup>-Rt/L</sup></i>. </p>
<p>So at this level, you
are really doing physics the way we like to do it. We like to study things,
write down some equations and solve the equations. Then we get a very precise
prediction on what will happen. Because now we don't have to guess when the
current will come to 90 percent of its maximum value. We can pick any number
you like, because we can now plot this graph. And let's plot this graph, <i>I(t)
</i>versus <i>t</i>. At<i> t </i>= 0, <i>e<sup>-0</sup> </i>is 1. You get 1 -
1, you get nothing. At <i>t</i> = infinity, <i>t</i> to the minus infinity is
0. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Over on the right
where it says <i>I&#732; </i>sub twiddle = negative<i> V<sub>0</sub> </i>over <i>R</i>,
should that be 0?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This one? Yeah, right. Thank you. Okay, so now this exponential has a full
strength of 1 at time equals 0. Goes to 0 at time equals infinity. Therefore
it takes away exponentially small stuff at very large times. And if you want
to know roughly how long should I wait, the answer is, the time you should wait
is roughly of order <i>L/R</i>. Because you can write this as <i>e<sup>-t</sup>/&#964;</i>,
where &#964; is <i>L/R</i>. Whenever we have an exponential, it will always be e to
the minus a physical quantity divided by some number that sets the scale for
the physical quantity. Exponentials fall exponentially. We know that. But
how long should I wait? Well, if you wait <i>t</i> = &#964; seconds, then it will
be 1/<i>e</i>, which is roughly 1 over third of the starting value and 1 minus
that will be roughly 2 thirds of its value. If you wait <i>t</i> = 3&#964;, <i>e</i><sup>-3</sup>
is 1 over 20, then you'll be what, 95 percent. So you can calculate everything
you need in this simple problem. </p>
<p>So now let's come to
the same problem. The switch has been closed for a long time and the current
has stabilized. So here is the switch. It has been closed. That&#39;s my<i> V<sub>0</sub></i>,
that's <i>R</i>. And the current, you remember, is <i>V<sub>0</sub>/R</i>.
This is <i>L</i>. So now we want to do something else. Now I want to open
that switch. So what do you think will happen if you open that switch? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The inductor will
resist the changing current.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
But how can it resist?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> By inducing the
magnetic field.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It can do what it wants, but how does it drive a current through the open
circuit?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> From energy stored
in the magnetic field. </p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
But in what manner will the current flow, given that I've broken the circuit?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> In the direction--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, but how will it manage to go around? It's like removing the bridge,
right? How will it go around? I agree with everything you said, but how will
it make the circuit? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> There'll be a
higher concentration of charges on one side than the other.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, but how will you really get rid of the current in a circuit that seems
open? Have you ever done this? Okay, that's just fine. But we know it has to
get rid of that current, because otherwise, what happened to the energy? It
has to go through. So you know what, you guys don't know what will happen if I
pull that switch. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is the current an
electric field? The change in the magnetic field will create an electric field
which doesn't need the closed circuit.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right, no I agree, it will have an electric field. But how will the electrons
flow when the wire has been interrupted, is all I'm asking you? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Will the current
oscillate, go back and forth?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You will have a
static discharge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You will have a discharge. You will have an arc. You will have a flash, and
that's when you'll hear a zip, and then it will jump this gap. So whenever you
remove the switch, you have to be careful that there is not stored energy
somewhere. You might think, &quot;Hey, I am pulling the plug on--&quot; well, I
won't say who. You're pulling the plug, okay, and what can it do to me? Well,
it can zap you, because this is a very dangerous place to pull the plug. So
you know what people do? They have another resistor. Let's call this guy <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>.
This is <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> is a huge number, 10,000
ohms let's say. So most of the time, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> doesn't do anything,
because when the current comes here in any situation, it looks at the inductor
and looks at 10,000 ohms and it says, &quot;I'm going this way.&quot; So
primarily, it will all go there, okay? </p>
<p>In the end, when the
switch has been closed for a very long time in our old experiment, when the
current is stabilized, you remember <i>LdI/dt </i>0 here. So there's 0 volts
between these two. That's the same 0 volt across <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>. No
current will flow in <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>. Everything will flow through <i>L</i>.
That current in fact will be <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>R</i>, because this
guy has been cut out of the loop. This is how it's going. But now if you
throw the switch open, you have given it a path to discharge. So the inductor
will discharge through the resistor. The current will continue to flow in this
direction. Of course, it cannot flow forever, because the resistor will burn
up the energy, but you're giving it a path. You're avoiding--in a way, if you
like, this is also a path with very, very high resistance. The air is a path
with very high resistance. That means by and large, there are no free carriers
in the air. But if the two tips get really charged, just like you said,
there'll be an emf that will pile up charges. They're jumping, they're waiting
to jump the gap. Eventually they'll polarize air, which is electrically
neutral, into + and - parts. Then the - will go one way, the + will go the
other way. You'll recognize that as a discharge. But you don't have to worry
about that now, because <i>R<sub>2</sub> </i>will take up your current. </p>
<p>So now the equation
we write is <i>LdI/dt </i>+ <i>RI</i> = 0 because if you start anywhere and you
go around a loop, you have no change in anything. There's no voltage. And the
answer to this one, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>, there <i>I </i>= <i>I<sub>0</sub>e</i>
to the &#8722;<i>R<sub>2</sub>/L </i>times <i>t</i>. So now the current will decay
exponentially. Again, with the time constant, <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>L</i>,
which is the 1 over the time constant, or the time constant is <i>L</i> over <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>.
So you put <i>L</i> in henries, <i>R</i> in ohms, you'll get some time. That
will give you an idea of how many times that time you have to wait before the
inductor is completely discharged. Well, it's never going to be fully
discharged. It's going to take forever, but if you say, &quot;Look, 1
thousandth of the original current is safe enough. How long do I have to
wait?&quot; you put .001 here and see what time you get. So you want <i>e<sup>&#8722;t/&#964;</sup>
</i>to be .001. So every big inductor you have in a circuit you will find has
got a resistor in parallel with it to take up the energy it has. </p>
<p>So let's do a little
energy calculation. The energy calculation will be, I had energy in the
inductor in the beginning, which is &frac12;<i>LI<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. What
happened to it? Well, we know what happened. There's a current in the
circuit, and when the current is flowing in the circuit, it is dissipating heat
in the resistor. Therefore the power in the resistor will be <i>I<sup>2</sup>R<sub>2</sub></i>.
<i>I<sup>2</sup></i> is<i> I<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> </i>due to the minus
twice <i>R<sub>2</sub>t/L </i>times another <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>. Now we
integrate this power from 0 to infinity, you will get <i>I<sub>0</sub></i><sup>2</sup><i>R<sub>2</sub></i>.
The integral of <i>e</i> to the minus something is <i>e</i> to the minus that
divided by that infinity to 0. I can promise you that what you will get will
be <i>L/2R<sub>2</sub></i>. It will give you then 1 over 2<i>LI<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.
So this is not a surprise, that the stored energy in the inductor is driving
your current. So if you want, one way to store energy, it's a capacitor, you
charge it and it discharge when you want the current to flow. Or you can have
an inductor, in which a current has been set up. Then when the power shuts off
in your house and somebody throws the switch, that inductor can keep the light
bulb burning, in fact forever. It will be infinite time before the bulb shuts
down, but you won't be able to see anything after a while, because this graph
is exponentially falling. This is a very simple problem where we can do the
math and we can understand what it's doing. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The graph, what is
that triangle thing?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This one here? This is called &#964;. You mean that symbol? Tau is a unit of time
whose numerical value is <i>R<sub>2</sub>/L </i>and we can write I as <i>I<sub>0</sub>e<sup>&#8722;t/&#964;</sup></i>.
We always like to write it in this form, so that if &#964; = 100 seconds, you will
have to make many multiples of 100 seconds before the current is negligible.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What are the units
on the axis?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, in this graph here? This is time and this is the current in the loop. It
starts out at some initial value. </p>
<p>Okay, now I'm going
to do the next slightly more complicated circuit, and that is an LC circuit.
If you have a circuit like that, it won't do anything. You can take these
guys, hook them up and wait all day. Nothing will happen because it's got no
energy. Why should it do anything? It's just going to sit there. But if
you've charged up your capacitor like this, and there's an open switch that you
then closed, then those + charges are going to leave and find their way around
the other side and neutralize them and the capacitor will discharge. But you
know that once it discharges, it's not the end of the story. So why is that?
Why doesn't it stop when the capacitor is discharged? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's kind of like
the inductor has momentum and it keeps pulling.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The inductor would have had a current by then, so the inductor is not going to
suddenly stop having its current. So it's going to keep driving more current
for a while, until the capacitor's charged up the opposite way to an extent
that this fights that one, that voltage, and then it will go the other way. So
it will go back and forth. So let's write down the equation that tells you how
it goes back and forth. So in other words, you should draw pictures.
Textbooks have nice pictures and I won't even try it. In the beginning, it may
look like--I'm sorry, in my example, in the beginning, there's an electric
field here, nothing in the capacitor. After a quarter cycle,
there's nothing here, there's a magnetic field in the inductor. Another
quarter cycle, it's back here, but with the opposite polarity, and it goes back
and forth. So we can get all that, by writing the equation <i>LdI/dt</i> + <i>Q/C</i>
= 0. So let's write everything in terms of <i>Q</i>. Then <i>dQ/dt</i> is <i>I</i>,
because as the current flows this way, it builds up charge. That's my
convention. So I can write it as <i>Ld<sup>2</sup>Q/dt<sup>2</sup> + (1/C)Q</i>
= 0. </p>
<p>Now we have seen
exactly this equation before, right? We saw the equation for a mass coupled to
a spring the equation <i>md<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup> +kx</i> = 0. Now we
know what it does. We know it oscillates back and forth. And <i>L</i>--this
is an SAT question--<i>L</i> is to <i>m</i> what <i>1/C</i> is to <i>k</i>.
It's very useful to bear in mind this analogy, because mathematically, this
equation and this equation have exactly the same solution. It's no more
difficult to solve this one than that one. This may involve electric charges;
that may involve masses. You don't care. So mathematically, here's an
equation: cow times <i>d<sup>2</sup></i> dog over <i>dt<sup>2</sup></i> + let's
say elephant times dog = 0, where dog is a function of time, has exactly the
same solution. What does it matter what you call the unknown variables,
right? But you've got to tell me that cow and elephant are time independent
and dog is the only thing that depends on time, because otherwise the equation
is not the same. So here m and k don't change, L and C don't change. So
what's the answer to this one? </p>
<p>Once again, it's the
differential equation. You write <i>dQ/dt</i> squared is &#8722; (<i>1/LC) Q</i> and
you're asking yourself, give me a function which, when I differentiate twice,
looks like itself. There's always the exponential. There's also sines and the
cosines and you can take any combination you like. And the one acceptable
solution is some constant <i>A</i> times cosine square root of 1 over <i>LC t.</i>
Is that right? Yes. If you take two derivatives of <i>Q</i>, you'll pull one
over root <i>LC</i> each time, then you'll get a - sine when cosine becomes -
sine and one more derivative will bring it back to - cosine. So this is called
the frequency, which is 1/&#8730;<i>LC</i>. That's the analog of square root of <i>k</i>
over <i>m</i>. Anyway, this will oscillate. It's a mechanical analog--it's
the electrical analog of the mechanical problem. So I don't want to do too
much of this, because I think you should be quite familiar with this, at least,
the oscillatory behavior of this. And the analogy is perfect. For example, to
say that I pulled the mass by 1 meter is to say that <i>x</i> was given a non-zero
value and <i>dx/dt</i> was 0. Analogous thing here will be <i>Q</i> was given a
non-zero value and <i>dQ/dt</i> which is <i>I,</i> is 0. That means the
capacitor was charged, the inductor was not carrying any current. Then I let
it go. What happens? The problems are identical. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> When you solve the
differential equation, why did you omit the sine?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, I should explain to you. That's an important point. <i>Q(t) </i>can be
one number, cosine <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub>t</i>. <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub></i> is this guy +
another number sine <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub>t</i>. And both are acceptable. And the
property of this differential equation is, if I have one answer, cos <i>&#969;t,</i>
and another possible answer, sine <i>&#969;t,</i> then any constant times cos + any
constant times sine is also a solution. You can verify that. If you have one
solution, <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>, a second solution, <i>Q<sub>2</sub></i>, you
can add the two equations and you can show <i>Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> </i>obeys
the same equation. Not only that, suppose there's one problem you solve, <i>dQ<sub>1</sub>/dt
</i>squared is <i>-&#969; </i>on <i>R</i> squared <i>Q<sub>1</sub></i>. There is
some function of time and here's another function of time, obeying the same
equation. Now you can multiply this by a number <i>A</i> and you can multiply
this by a number <i>B,</i> take the <i>A</i> inside the derivative, <i>B</i>
inside the derivative and add the two sides. On the left hand side you will
find the second derivative of <i>AQ<sub>1</sub> + BQ<sub>2</sub></i>. Right
hand side, you will find <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i> times <i>AQ<sub>1</sub>
+ BQ<sub>2</sub></i>. That means <i>AQ<sub>1</sub> + BQ<sub>2</sub></i> obeys
this same differential equation. </p>
<p>This is called
superposing two solutions. You've got one solution, another one, you can
multiply one by a constant. It's very important it's a constant, because
that's what will let you take it inside the derivative. Therefore the correct
answer here is really <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;d</i> + Bsin<i>&#969;t </i>and you can ask, why
did you write <i>A</i>cos<i>&#969;<sub>0</sub>t</i>? First of all, that's not a
good solution. I can put a &#934;
there which is arbitrary. And it's not hard to show--let me call that <i>C</i>
if you like, <i>C</i>. This can be written as <i>C</i>cos<i>&#969;<sub>0</sub>t</i>
- &#934;. In other words,
it's possible to take either a solution with a cosine and a sine, with no extra
phases inside, to another one with one amplitude and one phase. The phase is the
delay in the cosine. Anybody here has trouble, who does not know the details,
I'll be happy to explain why that's correct. </p>
<p>If you don't know,
you should tell me now. You can check that if you take this thing, make a
right angled triangle with <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> and an angle &#934; here, then <i>A</i>
can be written as <i>C</i>cos<i>&#934;</i> and <i>B</i> can be written as <i>C</i>sin<i>&#934;</i>, and that just
happens to be cos<i>&#969;t</i> - <i>&#934;</i>, this one, some trigonometry. So the
differential equation, with the second order in time, will always have two
unknown parameters in it. You can choose them to be these numbers <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, or this number <i>C</i> and <i>&#934;</i>. And the equation won't tell you what they
are, because once you tell me there's a mass coupled to a spring and I say,
&quot;Okay, this is the spring constant this is the mass?&quot; and I ask you,
&quot;Where is the mass right now?&quot; I don't know. It depends on when you
started it and how you released it. So I need to know what's called initial
conditions, which is the value of <i>Q</i> or the value of <i>x </i>at the
initial time and the value of the velocity or the current at an initial time.
With those two pieces of information, I can solve for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. </p>
<p>This I think you
should know, this kind of stuff you should know, so I won't say too much about
that. All right, so now we do another problem. We put an alternating voltage
on these guys. So this is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t </i>and this is <i>C</i>
and this is <i>L</i>. Now we ask, what's the current? This omega is not the
natural frequency of oscillation. It is some externally given omega, like 60
hertz from your power supply, from your socket. So that's driving the circuit
and you can ask, what happens now? The answer will be, you write the same
equation. You can write <i>Ld<sup>2</sup>Q/dt<sup>2</sup> </i>+ <i>(1/C)Q </i>=<i>
V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. Now what are you going to do? You have to
again guess the solution. So I want a function, <i>Q</i> of <i>t</i>, so that
when I take two derivatives and add it to some multiple of itself, I get
something, something times the cosine. So what should that function look
like? Yes? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, no, what function <i>Q</i> of<i> t</i> do you think will satisfy this
equation? I'm asking for a function of time which, when I put into this, has
some chance of obeying the equation. What's the functional form? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Cosine times some
constant.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. In other words, I can take it to be some constant, <i>C</i> times cos<i>&#969;t</i>,
period. Not even times &#934;. Take this one, see
what happens. Now when you take one derivative, you get -<i>&#969;LC</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
When you take another derivative, you get &#8722;<i>&#969;<sup>2</sup>L<sup>2</sup></i>--I'm
sorry, this becomes sine times cos<i>&#969;t</i>, and this one is just oh my
god--this is my nightmare. You can see the nightmare now? How many people see
the nightmare? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Constant <i>C</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, so I picked that <i>C</i> to be the same as this <i>C</i>. So we'll put a
hat on this guy so we can tell them about. So <i>C&#732;/C</i> times <i>C&#732;</i> is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
And what this tells you is, if you take two derivatives--I'm sorry, this is so
sloppy. If you take two derivatives here, you will get + <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup></i>.
cos<i>&#969;</i> be also be with the - sign. <i>Q/C</i>. Okay. You guys buy
that? There is no <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>, just an <i>L</i>. That = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
Right? Every derivative brings an &#969; and there's a net - sign. So you find out
that your guess, <i>C&#732;</i>cos<i>&#969;t</i> is going to work, provided this equation
is satisfied. And the cos<i>&#969;t</i> can be canceled. That's the whole point of doing this thing.
So then you get <i>C&#732;</i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub> - V<sub>0</sub></i> divided by <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup>L
&#8722; 1/C</i>. Or if you like, -<i>V<sub>0</sub>/L</i> divided by <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup>
- &#969;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. Don't worry about the numerator; look at the
denominator. The denominator says that if your driving frequency is equal to
the resonant frequency, <i>C&#732;</i> blows up. That means when a system has got a
resonance--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Where did the <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup></i>
come from?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I took two derivatives--oh, here. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. You know,
it's good to do these things slowly and not rely on what you heard somewhere.
So let me do it for you again. Sorry about that. So this time I take two
derivatives. Each one brings an <i>&#969;</i>. There is an L, and the - sine comes
because the cosine becomes - sine. Differentiate one more, you get - the
cosine. This guy is nothing. It just says &quot;divide my by <i>C</i>&quot;
and that's equal to that. And then I wrote 1/<i>LC</i> is <i>&#969;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.
Thank you very much. Okay? I was really hung up on the final result, which
tells you, you'd better not drive this at the resonant frequency, because then
current amplitude will build up indefinitely. That's also true in a swing. If
you've got a swing and the kid's coming back and forth, and you're reading a
newspaper just pushing the kid, you've got to push at the right time to get the
best result. And that kid's not going to fly off, because there's one more
term in the equation for the kid, which is friction. But if you have a
frictionless swing and you're doing this, you've got to watch out, because soon
there'll be nobody around, because the amplitude will keep growing. </p>
<p>Well, these are
unrealistic problems, but I want you to notice one thing. Here's what I want
you to notice. The voltage you were given looked like <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>
and the current that you got, I can obtain by taking the derivative of this
charge, which is like <i>dQ/dt</i>. That's going to be <i>C&#732;&#969;</i>sin<i>&#969;t</i>,
and <i>C&#732;,</i> we can write as <i>V<sub>0</sub>/L</i> divided by <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup>
- &#969;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>sin&#969;t</i>. This is <i>I</i>. Here's what I want
you to notice. It looks a lot like Ohm's law, because the current looks like
voltage divided by some number, but that's a very big difference. The voltage
is a cosine and the current is a sine. That's something I want you to think
about. The current is not in step with the voltage, whereas in a resistor
circuit, the current follows the voltage. It's the same profile as the
voltage, except you divide by <i>R</i>. Here one is a cosine, one is a sine.
That means when one guy is at maximum, other is at minimum. It's called out of
phase, in fact out of phase by 90 degrees. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> ________ by the <i>C</i>
that you got, where did the omega go?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Here?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> On the other
side. When you multiply that through by the <i>C</i>--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, <i>&#969;</i> did not go, it's back. Right here. You're right. There's the <i>&#969;</i>.
That came from... Okay, these problems, the only thing I'm focusing on right
now, I would say of all the things I wrote there, to be the most important
thing is number one, this is what I want you to bear in mind. That's why
sometimes I'm not paying attention to some constants. What is important to
notice is that this is an equation you can solve by inspection. Why was it
easier to solve it by inspection? Because you are trying to get in the end a
cosine to balance the right hand side, and you're trying to find a function who
is itself a cosine, or whose second derivative is a cosine, and we know the
answer to that is a cosine, so we can guess the answer. Once you guess the
answer, you put it in and you analyze the solution, you notice also that the
current and the voltage are not in step. One is a cosine. You know what a
cosine does, it does that. Other is a sine, so they are out of step. When one
is at maximum, the other is at minimum and so on. </p>
<p>That means a current
as a function of time is not equal to the voltage as a function of time divided
by anything. There is nothing you can divide a cosine by to turn it into a
sine. Whereas with resistors, you just divide by R, you get the current. Now
for the more realistic problem, the realistic problem has got a capacitor, an
inductor and a resistor and no other power supply. The equation obeyed by this
one will be <i>Ld<sup>2</sup>Q/dt<sup>2</sup> </i>(that stands for <i>LdI/dt</i>)
+ <i>RdQ/dt </i>+ <i>Q/C </i>= 0. This is analogous to <i>md<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup>
</i>+ (I don't know how you guys wrote this thing last semester. It doesn't
matter) &#947;<i>dx/dt </i>+ <i>kx</i> = 0. Notice that it's the same form. And
I'm going to give this to you as a homework problem to analyze the answer to
this one. So this describes a problem where you have a mass and a spring and
some friction on the table. This means if you pull it and let it go, the
oscillations will eventually get damped and it will die down. And the general
solution for the case when it's oscillating will look like some number A <i>e</i>
to the minus some number &#945;t times cosine times some frequency <i>&#969;&#39;t</i>. Let
me see. You can always add a phase <i>&#934;</i>, but I'm not going to do that. If you want,
you can put an extra &#934;, but I'll choose my
origin of time so that I don&#39;t have that. This is what the answer's going to
look like, where <i>&#969;</i>&#39; and <i>&#945; </i>are going to be controlled by<i> L, R </i>and
<i>C</i>. That's the thing I don't want to do in class. Have you seen this
before? Professor Harris tells me you've seen this last time. And the hints
in the homework will guide you on how to do this. You just assume the solution
<i>x </i>at<i> t </i>looks like some <i>A e </i>to the - (I don't want to call
it <i>&#945;</i> now) <i>&#946;</i> times <i>t</i>. You put it in the equation and solve
for <i>&#946;</i> and you'll find <i>&#946; </i>will have a real part and an imaginary
part. And you have to combine the two to get this answer. </p>
<p>Now that brings me to
another thing, so I don't know how prepared you guys are for what's about to
happen next, which is the use of complex numbers. So everybody familiar with
complex numbers? Who doesn't know complex numbers? How do you do your taxes?
You don't know imaginary numbers? So I will tell you. I'll give you a lightning
review. I'm assuming everybody has seen them in high school. I will only tell
you the part you need, but I'm going to assume that I can use them fluently. I
don't want to stop every time and worry about you guys. So I really need a
show of hands. Anybody never seen <i>x + iy</i> and <i>x - iy</i>? And how
about <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup></i>? You know that guy? Okay, that's all you need.
So I'm going to tell you what the deal is. So everyone knows what a complex
number is. We know <i>i</i> is square root of -1. Then we know that we can write
a complex number as <i>x + iy</i> and visualize it in a complex plane where you
measure <i>x</i> this way and <i>iy</i> is measured that way. That's usually
called a generic complex number <i>z</i>. But now let us find the length of
that--the complex number is a single point in the complex plane. The length of
that is square root of <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></i>. So I can also
write <i>z</i> as <i>x</i> divided by square root of <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></i>
+ <i>i</i> times<i> y</i> divided by square root of <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></i>
times the square root of <i>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></i>. Just done
nothing, just rearranged stuff. </p>
<p>This is going to be
called the modulus of <i>z</i>, and what is this? This angle is <i>&#952;</i>
here. This is really cos<i>&#952;</i> + <i>i</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> times modulus of <i>z</i>.
And that, thanks to this great identity by Euler, is <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup>.</i>
Now I don&#39;t know how much you know about this great formula that relates <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup>
</i>to cosine + sine. How many people know where it comes from? What does it
mean to raise <i>e</i> to a complex power? You know where it really comes
from? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It comes from power series. It turns out you can write a power series for
cosine. You can write a power series for sine, then, for example, cosine of <i>&#952;</i>
= 1 &#8722; <i>&#952;<sup>2</sup> </i>over 2 factorial, <i>&#952;</i> to the 4 factorial, or 6
factorial, etc. And you can write a power series for <i>e<sup>&#952;</sup> </i>if
you like, which is 1 + &#952; + <i>&#952;<sup>2</sup>/</i>2. This defines cos<i>&#952;</i> in
the sense that if you put <i>&#952;</i> = <i>&Pi;</i>/2 in this infinite series, you
will get 0. And if you put <i>&#952; = &Pi;, </i>you will get <i>&Pi; </i>-1. In other
words, in spite of this funny looking form, it really is the same guy. It will
oscillate, it will have zeros, it will be periodic. None of it is obvious, but
this power series is numerically equal to this one if you keep the infinite
number of turns. Likewise, <i>e<sup>&#952;</sup></i> is defined by this series.
And similarly, there's a formula for sin<i>&#952;</i>. Now once a power series is
defined, you can put e raised to anything you want there. </p>
<p>So you know what I'm
going to put there. <i>e </i>raised to dog is 1 + dog + dog squared. This is
not a joke. This is really true. This is the definition. If someone says,
&quot;How do I raise <em>e</em> to the power dog?&quot; you do this. This will have all
the properties of the exponential. It doesn't matter what's in the exponent.
That's the key. People originally put real numbers, then they put complex
numbers. Now they put matrices, operators, anything you want. <i>e</i> raised
to anything, you formally define to be this infinite series, provided the
infinite series converges and gives you a meaningful answer. In that sense, if
you put <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup> </i>here, and compare the result to cos<i>&#952;</i> + <i>i</i>sin&#952;,
it matches, that's all. I'm just going to keep using that result. Then you
should also know that for every complex number, there's a complex conjugate,
which is <i>x - iy</i>. That means<i> i </i>goes to -<i>i</i>. That means <i>z</i>,
the angle <i>&#952; </i>will change to -<i>&#952;</i>. And given any complex number, the
real part of <i>z</i>, which is <i>x</i>, is <i>z + z&#42; </i>over 2 and the
imaginary part of <i>z</i>, which is <i>y</i>, is <i>z &#8722; z&#42; </i>over 2<i>i</i>.</p>
<p>This is what you need
to know. Every complex number has a real part and an imaginary part. In fact, <i>z&#42;</i>
looks like this. And if you add<i> z + z&#42;, </i>the vertical parts cancel and
you get double the horizontal part. That's why you divide by 2. You subtract
and divide by 2<i>i, </i>you get <i>y</i>. Basically, that's all I want you to
know, but I want you to be able to manipulate them rapidly enough. Here's something
very useful about complex numbers. Let's take a complex number <i>z<sub>1</sub></i>
which is mod <i>z<sub>1</sub>e<sup>i&#952;1</sup></i>, and another complex number, <i>z<sub>2</sub></i>,
which is mod <i>z<sub>2</sub>e<sup>i&#952;2</sup></i>. So what do they look like?
Well, <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> looks like this, with some angle <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub></i>,
and <i>z<sub>2</sub></i><sub> </sub>may look like that. It's got some angle <i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i>.
So every complex number has a length and an angle. You can think of it two
ways. It's got an <i>x</i> part and a <i>y</i> part, and a real and an
imaginary, or it's got a modulus and a phase. That's the Cartesian version of
the number and the polar number of the number. And the connection between them
comes from Euler's formula. </p>
<p>But now look what
happens when I take the product <i>z<sub>1</sub>z<sub>2</sub></i>. I get mod <i>z<sub>1</sub></i>
mod <i>z<sub>2</sub> e<sup>i&#952;</sup><sub>1</sub><sup> + &#952;</sup><sub>2</sub></i>,
because exponentials add when you multiply them. Well, this allows you to
immediately guess what the product is going to look like. The product is going
to have a length equal to the length of <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> times length of <i>z<sub>2</sub></i>.
It's going to have an angle, I've not done a good picture here, which is the
sum of the two angles, because it's <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub> + &#952;<sub>2</sub></i>. So
listen to this statement very carefully. When you take a complex number, say
number 1, and you multiply it by a second complex number, you do two things to
the first guy. You rescale it and you rotate it. So two operations are done
in one shot when you use complex numbers. The mod <i>z<sub>2</sub> </i>rescale
is the mod <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i> adds to <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub></i>.
Likewise, if you divide, if you take <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> over <i>z<sub>2</sub>,</i>
it is mod <i>z<sub>1</sub></i> over mod <i>z<sub>2</sub> </i>times <i>e<sup>i&#952;</sup><sub>1
</sub><sup>- &#952;</sup><sub>2</sub></i>, because the exponential <i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i>
is downstairs. </p>
<p>So multiplication by
real numbers is very easy. You take a real number 4, you multiply by 8, you'll
get something in the real axis 8 times longer. You multiply by -8, you'll get
something back here. With complex numbers, you take a number, you multiply
another number, you rescale and you rotate. That's what I want you to know.
That's going to be very important for what I'm saying. </p>
<p>Now I come to the
problem I really want to solve, which is an LCR circuit driven by an
alternating source, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. This is <i>R</i>, this is
<i>C</i> and this is <i>L</i>. And the equation we have to solve is <i>L dI/dt</i>
+ <i>RI</i> + 1<i>/C</i> integral <i>I</i> <i>dt</i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> cos<i>&#969;t</i>.
Because <i>Q</i> is the integral up to time t of the current, that's just <i>Q/C.</i>
It's the same equation, but now, unlike in this problem, where I had no driving
voltage, I have a driving voltage, and I've also written it in terms of current
rather than in terms of charge. Because in electrical engineering, you don't
really watch the charge in the capacitor. You look at the current flowing through
the circuit. </p>
<p>So you have to solve
this equation. The question is, can you guess the answer? That's the only way
we know. You've got to guess. You're trying to find a function, <i>I </i>of <i>t</i>,
so that when you differentiate it, you get a cosine <i>&#969;t</i>, when you
integrate it, you get a cosine <i>&#969;t</i>. So far we can do it. Sine<i> &#969;t </i>will
do it. But when you leave it alone, then also you get a cosine <i>&#969;t.</i> You
cannot do that, because sine will become a cosine and sine will become a sine.
In the LC circuit, when you didn't have this guy, we were okay, because if you
pick a sine, this became a cosine and that also became a cosine and you can
combine them to get a cosine. But you cannot have <i>dI/dt</i>, I and integral
of I all in one equation and all satisfied by trigonometric function. </p>
<p>The only time we can
guess the answer is if it looks like <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>&#945;t</sup></i>.
Suppose that was the voltage. Then can you guess the answer, what form the
answer will have? It will also be <i>e<sup>&#945;t</sup> </i>times some number,
because then this will look <i>e<sup>&#945;t</sup>,</i> that will look like<i> e<sup>&#945;t</sup></i>,
that will look like <i>e<sup>&#945;t</sup></i>. <i>e<sup>&#945;t</sup> </i>has a great
property that whether you multiply it, whether you integrate it, differentiate
it or leave it alone, it looks the same. Unfortunately, no one's interested in
this voltage, because it's growing exponentially fast, or if you put a - sign,
it's dying exponentially. What we really want is this. So the question is,
how do we solve this problem with cos<i>&#969;t</i>? So we're going to use a
certain trick. The trick I'm going to use is the following: let me take a
general case where this is some function <i>V </i>of <i>t</i>, where I'm not
even assuming <i>V</i> is real. I'm not assuming <i>I</i> is real, but <i>L</i>
and <i>R</i> and <i>C</i> are real. Everything else can be complex numbers. </p>
<p>Now once you have an
equation and you've found a solution, if you take the complex conjugate of both
sides, they will still match. Do you understand that? If two things are
equal, their complex conjugates are equal, because this thing is the real +
imaginary that balances the real + imaginary on the other side. Complex
conjugate just reverses the imaginary terms, so they will still match when you
flip both sides. So it means if you take <i>L dI&#42; </i>of <i>dt + R </i>times <i>I&#42;
+ 1/C </i>integral <i>I&#42; of t&#39; dt&#39; </i>t <i>= V&#42; </i>of<i> t</i>. So star is
the rule by which if <i>V </i>had a real and imaginary part, you flip the
imaginary part. So that solution for <i>V</i> of <i>t</i> implies a second
equation. In other words, if the voltage <i>V</i> drives a current <i>I</i>,
the conjugate of the voltage drives the conjugate of the current. That simply
follows from the equation. It comes from the fact that when I conjugated it, <i>L,
R </i>and <i>C</i> are real. </p>
<p>Do you understand
that? Suppose <i>L</i> were imaginary or had imaginary part, then I must also
put a conjugate on <i>L</i>. Then<i> I&#42;</i> obeys a different equation,
because this had <i>L</i> in it, this had <i>L&#42;</i> in it. But if everything
is real, <i>I&#42;</i> obeys the same equation when you have a <i>V&#42;</i> driving
it. I'm almost done now. I want you to add the left hand side to the left
hand side and the right hand side to the right hand side, and what do I get?
Well, if I write it here, you may not be able to see it. Let me put it here
then. If you add these two, you'd get <i>L d/dt</i> of <i>I</i> + <i>I&#42;</i> + <i>R</i>
times <i>I</i> + <i>I&#42; + 1/C</i> integral of <i>I + I&#42; dt</i> = <i>V + V&#42;.</i>
This again comes because the equation is a linear equation. You can always add
the left hand side and the right hand side to get another problem where the
driving voltage is <i>V + V&#42; </i>and the driving current is <i>I + I&#42;, </i>etc.
But <i>I + I&#42; </i>is 2 times the real part of <i>I</i> and <i>V + V&#42;</i> is 2
times the real part of <i>V</i>. Therefore this implies that <i>L d/dt </i>of
the real part of <i>I</i> + <i>R </i>plus the real part of <i>I + </i>1/<i>C</i>
times the integral of the real part of<i> I </i>= real part of <i>V</i>. </p>
<p>So let me say in
words what the equation means. If you by luck solve an equation with a complex
potential V, and you get a current, then the answer to the problem where the
potential is only the real part of the actual potential you applied, the
current will be the real part of the answer you got. That's all I want you to
know. If you solve a complex problem with a driving voltage which is
complex--which is just a mathematical fiction, in real life you don't have
that--then the current that you get will also be complex. But its real part
will be due to the real part of your voltage. And you can also show the
imaginary part of the current will be due to the imaginary part of the
voltage. This is just the principle of superposition. </p>
<p>So here is the trick
we are going to use. We are going to go back to original equation, <i>LdI/dt +
RI + 1/C</i> integral <i>I dt</i> = V<sub>0</sub>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, and we're going
to solve a new problem. We're going to solve a problem where this is <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>.
And the current for that, I'm going to call some <i>I&#732;</i>. It's a complex
current, because the driving voltage is a complex voltage. So think of <i>Ve<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>
as the <i>V</i> in the previous problem. </p>
<p>The actual problem I
was given had V<sub>0</sub>cos<i>&#969;t</i>, but you know that <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>
is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i> + <i>I</i> times <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>sin<i>&#969;t</i>.
Consequently, this potential has a real part which is a cosine, an imaginary
part which is a sine, and the current will have a real and imaginary part. The
answer to the original question is the real part of the answer to this
question. This is what you should think about. This is what you should
understand. So I've manufactured a problem with an unphysical complex voltage,
and all I know is that at the end of the day, if I take the real part of the
current, I'll get the answer to the real part of the potential, which happens
to be the actual potential, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. So why would I
do all this? Why would I take a problem that's bad enough with the cosine and
turn it into a complex exponential? I think you can sort of guess what the
reason is. The reason is that it may be complex, but it's still an
exponential. </p>
<p>That means its
derivative is going to look just the same. That means I can make a guess that
the current <i>I&#732; </i>is proportional to <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>.</i> So you can
make the assumption that <i>I&#732;</i> of <i>t</i> is some constant <i>I&#732; </i>times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>.</i>
Make that assumption and put it into this equation and see what you get. You
will find you will get <i>I&#969;L </i>times<i> I&#732;</i> + <i>R</i> times <i>I&#732; </i>+ 1<i>/I&#969;C
</i>times I&#732; times e<sup>I&#969;t</sup> is V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup>. This is
because if you assume the current is an exponential, every derivative = an<i>
i&#969; </i>and every integral = 1/<i>i&#969;,</i> and multiplying is just multiplying.
So <i>d/dt </i>has got to be replaced by <i>&#969;</i>, and you get this equation
for<i> I&#732;.</i> That means you will satisfy the equation, provided <i>I&#732;</i>
times all of this = <i>V</i> . And I'm going to write this as <i>Z</i> times <i>I&#732;
= V </i>where <i>Z</i> is the name for all the guys multiplying <i>I&#732;</i>. So
I'll start with that here. </p>
<p>Okay. So I wrote<i>
i&#969;L</i> + <i>R + 1 </i>over <i>i&#969;C I&#732; e<sup>i&#969;t</sup> </i>is <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>.
Everybody get that? That's because differentiating on an exponential is just
multiplying by the exponent. So this is a complex number. <i>R + i&#969;L &#8722; i/&#969;C</i>.
I want you to know that <i>i </i>in the bottom is like -<i>i </i>in the top.
And this is called the impedance <i>Z</i>, it's a complex number. You can
visualize the complex number as follows: it's got a real part, which is <i>R</i>.
It's got an imaginary part, which is <i>&#969;L &#8722; 1/&#969;C</i>, and the impedance <i>Z</i>
is a complex number with some modulus and some phase. If you know the real and
imaginary parts, you can construct the modulus in the phase like that. If you
want, it's the modulus of <i>Z</i>. Therefore canceling this, I find <i>I&#732; = V<sub>0</sub>/Z</i>.
That becomes V<sub>0</sub> over the modulus of Z times e<sup>i</sup><sup>&#934;</sup>, where &#934; is this angle
defined by tan&#934; = &#969;L &#8722; 1/&#969;C divided
by R. So don't worry too much about writing all of this down, because this
you're going to find in every book. There's nothing novel or different. </p>
<p>So this is the
formula for <em>I </em>twiddle. Now <em>I</em> itself, you remember, = <i>I&#732;</i> of 0. I'm sorry,
this is <i>I&#732;</i> of 0. Did I define it that way? Yeah, I should write it--I'm
sorry. I should write it as <i>I&#732;</i> of 0. There's a subscript 0 there,
because the full I twiddle has got an <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> in it. That looks
like <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> over mod <i>Z</i> times <i>e<sup>i&#969;t - </sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. But this is not
the physical current, because it's the result of a complex voltage. The
physical current is a real part of this, without the twiddle, that we write as
real part of <i>I&#732;.</i> Where do I get the real part? <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> and
absolute value of <i>Z</i> are both real. Real part of <i>e</i> to the<i> i</i>
something is cosine of something and that's our answer. That's our answer, the
final answer you get. </p>
<p>This tells you that
the current has a magnitude which is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> over the absolute
value of <i>Z</i>, and it's got a phase <i>&#934;</i> by which it is behind the driving voltage.
The magnitude of <i>Z</i> for as in any complex number, if someone says,
&quot;What's the magnitude of <i>Z</i>?&quot; it is simply square root of real
part squared + imaginary part squared. </p>
<p>So I want you to
think about the magic of complex numbers. Your final answer has a current which
is a cos<i>&#969;t</i> - <i>&#934;</i>. Your driving
voltage is a cos<i>&#969;t</i>. There is no way you can divide the voltage by
anything to get that current. But in the complex language, the complex current
is the complex voltage divided by the complex impedance. How does the happen?
That happens because impendence <i>Z</i> has got a magnitude and a phase,
therefore if you had a voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i> and you
divide by mod <i>Z e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i><i>,</i> that becomes <i>e<sup>-i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i> upstairs. You're
able to change the magnitude and you're able to change the phase by dividing. </p>
<p>So if you want to
take the voltage and you want to rescale it and shift its phase, all in one
shot, you can do it if you divide by a complex number, because a complex number
will rescale it and also shift its phase. And then you take the real part. In
other words, cos<i>&#969;t</i> divided by nothing will give you cos<i>&#969;t - </i><i>&#934;</i>, but <i>e<sup>i&#969;t</sup></i>,
when divided by <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>, will in fact give you <i>e<sup>i&#969;t - i</sup></i><i><sup>&#934;</sup></i>. So that phase
shift we can produce only by dividing with a complex number. So I'll come back
and explain to you a little bit more on how you do circuit problems using the
complex impedance, but I think it will be helpful for those of you who don't
know complex numbers to get use to this part of it.</p>
