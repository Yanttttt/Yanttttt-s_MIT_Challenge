<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> All right, today's topic is the theory of nearly everything, okay? You wanted
to know the theory of everything? You're almost there, because I'm finally
ready to reveal to you the laws of quantum dynamics that tells you how things
change with time. So that's the analog of <i>F = ma</i>. That's called the
Schr&#246;dinger equation, and just about anything you see in this room, or on this
planet, anything you can see or use is really described by this equation I'm
going to write down today. It contains Newton's laws as part of it, because if
you can do the quantum theory, you can always find hidden in it the classical
theory. That's like saying if I can do Einstein's relativistic kinematics at
low velocities, I will regain Newtonian mechanics. So everything is contained
in this one. There are some things left, of course, that we won't do, but this
goes a long way. So I'll talk about it probably next time near the end,
depending on how much time there is. But without further ado, I will now tell
you what the laws of motion are in quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>So let's go back one
more time to remember what we have done. The analogous statement is, in
classical mechanics for a particle moving in one dimension, all I need to know
about it right now is the position and the momentum. That's it. That's the
maximal information. You can say, &quot;What about other things? What about
angular momentum? What about kinetic energy? What about potential energy?
What about total energy?&quot; They're all functions of<i> x </i>and<i> p</i>.
For example, in 3 dimensions,<i> x </i>will be replaced by <i>r</i>, <i>p</i> will
be replaced by some vector <i>p</i>, and there's a variable called angular
momentum, but you know that once you know <i>r</i> and <i>p</i> by taking the cross product. That's it. And you can say, &quot;What
happens when I measure any variable for a classical particle in this state, <i>x, p</i>?&quot;
Well, if you know the location, it's guaranteed to be<i> x </i>100 percent,
momentum is <i>p</i>, 100 percent. Any other function of <i> x </i>and <i>p</i>,
like <i>r</i> x <i>p</i>, is guaranteed to have that particular value.
So everything is completely known. </p>
<p>That's the situation
at one time. Then you want to say, &quot;What can you say about the future?
What's the rate of change of these things?&quot; And the answer to that is, <i>d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup></i>
times <i>m</i> is the force, and in most problems you can write the force as a
derivative of some potential. So if you knew the potential, 1/<i>2kx</i><sup>2</sup>
or whatever it is, or <i>mgx</i>, you can take the derivative on the right hand
side, and the left hand side tells you the rate of change of <i>x</i>. I want
you to note one thing: we know an equation that tells you something about the
acceleration. Once the forces are known, there's a unique acceleration. So
you are free to give the particle any position you like, and any velocity, <i>dx/dt</i>.
That&#39;s essentially the momentum. You can pick them at random. But you cannot
pick the acceleration at random, because the acceleration is not for you to
decide. The acceleration is determined by Newton's laws to equal the
essentially the force divided by mass. That comes from the fact mathematically
that this is a second order equation in time, namely involving the second
derivative. And that, from a mathematical point of view, if the second
derivative is determined by external considerations, initial conditions are
given by initial <i>x</i> and the first derivative. All higher derivatives are
slaved to the applied force. You don&#39;t assign them as you wish. You find out
what they are from the equations of motion. That's really all of classical
mechanics. </p>
<p>Now you want to do
quantum mechanics, and we have seen many times the story in quantum mechanics
is a little more complicated. You ask a simple question and you get a very
long answer. The simple question is, how do you describe the particle in
quantum mechanics in one dimension? And you say, &quot;I want to assign to it
a function <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i>.&quot; <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> is any reasonable
function which can be squared and integrated over the real line. Anything you
write down is a possible state. That's like saying, any <i>x</i> and any <i>p</i>
are allowed. Likewise, <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> is nothing special.
It can be whatever you like as long as you can square it and integrate it to
get a finite answer over all of space. </p>
<p>That's the only
condition. And if your all of space goes to infinity, then <i>Y</i> should vanish a + and- infinity.
That's the only requirement. Then you say, &quot;That tells me everything.
Why don't you tell me what the particle is doing?&quot; And you can say,
&quot;What do you want to know?&quot; Well, I want to know where it is.
That's when you don't get a straight answer. You are told, &quot;Well, it can
be here, it can be there, it can be anywhere else. And the probability density
that it's at point <i>x</i> is proportional to the absolute square of <i>Y</i>.&quot; That means you take the <i>Y</i> and you square it, so it will have
nothing negative in it. Everything will be real and positive, and <i>Y</i> itself may be complex. But this <i>Y</i><sup>2</sup>, I told you over and
over, is defined to be <i>Y</i>&#42;<i>Y</i>. That's real and positive. Then you
can say, &quot;What if I measure momentum, what answer will I get?&quot;
That's even longer. First you are supposed to expand--I'm not going to do the
whole thing too many times--you're supposed to write this <i>Y</i> as some coefficient times these very
special functions. In a world of size <i>L</i>, you have to write the given <i>Y</i> in this fashion, and the coefficients
are determined by the integral of the complex conjugate of this function times
the function you gave me, <i>Y</i>(x).
</p>
<p>Now I gave some
extra notes, I think. Did people get that? Called the &quot;Quantum
Cookbook?&quot; That's just the recipe, you know. Quantum mechanics is a big
fat recipe and that's all we can do. I tell you, you do this, you get these
answers. That's my whole goal, to simply give you the recipe. So the recipe
says--what's interesting about quantum mechanics, what makes it hard to teach,
is that there are some physical principles which are summarized by these rules,
which are like axioms. Then there are some purely mathematical results which
are not axioms. They are consequences of pure mathematics. You have to keep in
mind, what is a purely mathematical result, therefore is deduced from the laws
of mathematics, and what is a physical result, that's deduced from experiment.
The fact that <i>Y</i> describes everything
is a physical result. Now it tells you to write <i>Y</i> as the sum of these functions, and
then the probability to obtain any momentum <i>p</i> is <i>A</i><sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>,
where <i>A</i><sub>p</sub> is defined by this. </p>
<p>The mathematics comes
in in the following way: first question is, who told you that I can write every
function <i>Y</i> in this fashion?
That's called the Fourier's theorem, that guarantees you that in a circle of
size <i>L</i>, every periodic function, meaning that returns to its starting
value, may be expanded in terms of these functions. That's the mathematical
result. The same mathematical result also tells you how to find the
coefficients. The postulates of quantum mechanics tell you two things. <i>A<sub>p</sub></i><sup>2</sup>
is the probability that you will get the value <i>p</i> when you measure
momentum, okay? That's a postulate, because you could have written this
function 200 years before quantum mechanics. It will still be true, but this
function did not have a meaning at that time as states of definite momentum.
How do I know it's a state of definite momentum? If every term vanished except
one term, that's all you have, then one coefficient will be <i>A</i> something
= 1, everything is 0, that means the probability for getting momentum has a non
0 value only for that momentum. All other momenta are missing in that
situation. Another postulate of quantum mechanics is that once you measure
momentum and you get one of these values, the state will go from being a sum
over many such functions, and collapse to the one term and the sum that
corresponds to the answer you got. </p>
<p>Then here is another
mathematical result: p is not every arbitrary real number you can imagine. We
make the requirement, if you go around on a circle, the function should come
back to the starting value, therefore <i>p</i> is restricted to be 2<i>p</i><i><u>&#8463;</u></i>/<i>L</i> times some
integer <i>n</i>. That's a mathematical requirement, because if you think <i>Y</i> <sup>2</sup> is the probability, <i>Y</i> should come back to where you start.
It cannot get two different values of <i>Y</i>
when you go around the circle. That quantizes momentum to these values. </p>
<p>The last thing I did
was to say, if you measure energy, what answer will you get? That's even
longer. There you're supposed to solve the following equations<i>, (((h</i><sup>2</sup><i>/2m)d<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub><i>/dx<sup>2</sup>) +
V(x)) </i><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub><i>(x) = E</i><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>(x). In other words,
for energy the answer's more complicated, because before, I can tell you
anything. I want you to solve this equation. This equation says, if in
classical mechanics the particle was in some potential <i>V(x)</i> and the
particle had some mass <i>m</i>, you have to solve this equation, then it's a
purely mathematical problem, and you try to find all solutions that behave well
at infinity, that don't blow up at infinity, that vanish at infinity. That
quantizes E to certain special values. And there are corresponding functions, <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub> for each allowed value.
</p>
<p>Then you are done,
because then you make a similar expansion, you write the unknown <i>Y</i> and namely some arbitrary <i>Y</i> that's given to you. You write it as
a &#931;<i>A<sub>E</sub></i><i>Y</i><i><sub>E</sub></i><i>(x),</i> where <i>A<sub>E</sub></i>
is found by a similar rule. Just replace <i>p</i> by <i>E</i> and replace this
function by these functions. Then if you square <i>A<sub>E</sub></i> you will
get the probability you will get the energy. So what makes the energy problem
more complicated is that whereas for momentum we know once and for all these
functions describe a state of definite momentum where you can get only one
answer, states of definite energy depend on what potential is acting on the
particle. If it's a free particle, <i>V</i> is 0. If it's a particle that in
Newtonian mechanics is a harmonic oscillator, <i>V(x)</i> would be ½<i>kx</i><sup>2</sup>
and so on. So you should know the classical potential and you've got it in for
every possible potential you have to solve this. But that's what most people
in physics departments are doing most of the time. They're solving this
equation to find states of definite energy. So today, I'm going to tell you
why states of definite energy are so important. What's the big deal? Why is
state of momentum not so important? Why is the state of definite position not
so interesting? What is privileged about the states of definite momentum? And
now you will see the role of energy. </p>
<p>So I'm going to write
down for you the equation that's analog of <i>F = ma</i>. So what are we
trying to do? <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> is like <i>x</i> and
<i>p</i>. You don't have a time label here. These are like saying at some
time a particle has a position and a momentum. In quantum theory or some time,
it has a wave function <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i>. But the real
question in classical mechanics is, how does <i>x</i> vary with time and how
does p vary with time. The answer is, according to <i>F = ma</i>. And here
the question is, how does <i>Y</i>
vary with time? First thing you've got to do is to realize that <i>Y</i> itself can be a function of time,
right? That's the only time you've got to ask, &quot;What does it do with
time?&quot; So at <i>t</i> = 0 it may look like this. A little later, it may
look like that. So it's flopping and moving, just like say a string. It's
changing with time and you want to know how it changes with time. So this is
the great Schr&#246;dinger equation. It says <i>i<u>&#8463;</u></i>d<i>Y</i>(<i>x,t</i>)/dt (it's partial, because this depends
on <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> so this is the <i>t</i> derivative) = the following,
[-<i><u>&#8463;</u></i><sup>2</sup> /<i>2m d<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i>/dx<sup>2</sup> + V(x) <i>Y</i><i>(x,t)]</i>. That's the
equation. <i>x</i> comma <i>t</i>. </p>
<p>So write this down,
because if you know this equation, you'll be surprised how many things you can
calculate. From this follows the spectrum of the atoms, from this follows what
makes a material a conductor, a semiconductor, a superconductor. Everything
follows from this famous Schr&#246;dinger equation. This is an equation in which
you must notice that we're dealing for the first time with functions of time.
Somebody asked me long back, &quot;Where is time?&quot; Well, here is how <i>Y</i> varies with time. So suppose someone
says, &quot;Here is initial <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and 0. Tell me what
is <i>Y</i> a little later, 1
millisecond later.&quot; Well, it's the rate of change of <i>Y</i> with time multiplied by 1
millisecond. The rate of change of <i>Y</i>
at the initial time is obtained by taking that derivative of <i>Y</i> and adding to it V times <i>Y</i>, you get something. That&#39;s how much
<i>Y</i> changes. Multiply by
<i>D</i><i>t</i>, that's the change
in <i>Y</i>. That'll give you <i>Y</i> at a later time. This is the first
order equation in time. What that means mathematically is, the initial <i>Y</i> determines the future completely.
This is different from position where you need <i>x</i> and <i>dx/dt</i> are
the initial time. The equation will only tell you what <i>d<sup>2</sup>x/dt<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>is. But in quantum mechanics, <i>d</i><i>Y</i><i> /dt</i> itself is determined, so you don't get to
choose that. You just get to choose the initial <i>Y</i>. That means an initial wave function
completely determines the future according to this equation. </p>
<p>So don&#39;t worry about
this equation. I don't expect you all to see it and immediately know what to
do, but I want you to know that there is an equation. That is known now.
That's the analog of <i>F = ma.</i> If you solve this equation, you can
predict the future to the extent allowed by quantum mechanics. Given the
present, and the present means <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>0<i>)</i> is given, then you go to the math department
and say, &quot;This is my <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>0<i>).</i> Please
tell me by some trick what is <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and <i>t</i>.&quot; It turns out there is a trick by
which you can predict <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and <i>t.</i> Note
also that this number <i>i</i> is present in the very equations of motion. So
this is not like the <i>i</i> we used in electrical circuits where we really
meant sines and cosines, but we took <i>e<sup>t</sup></i><i><sup>q</sup></i>or <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup>w</sup></i><i><sup>t</sup></i>, always hoping in
the end to take the real part of the answer because the functions of classical
mechanics are always real. But in quantum theory, <i>Y</i> is intrinsically complex and it
cannot get more complex than that by putting an <i>i </i>in the equations of
motion, but that's just the way it is. You need the <i>i </i>to write the
equations. Therefore our goal then is to learn different ways in which we can
solve this. Now remember, everybody noticed, this looks kind of familiar here,
this combination. It's up there somewhere. It looks a lot like this. You see
that? But it's not quite that. That is working on a function only of <i>x</i>;
this is working on a function of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. And there are partial
derivatives here and there are total derivatives there. They are very
privileged functions. They describe states of definite energy. This is an
arbitrary function, just evolving with time, so you should not mix the two up.
This <i>Y</i> is a generic <i>Y</i> changing with time. </p>
<p>So let's ask, how can
I calculate the future, given the present? How do I solve this equation? So
here is what you do. I'm going to do it at two levels. One is to tell you a
little bit about how you get there, and for those of you who say, &quot;Look,
spare me the details, I just want to know the answer,&quot; I will draw a box
around the answer, and you are free to start from there. But I want to give
everyone a chance to look under the hood and see what's happening. So given an
equation like this, which is pretty old stuff in mathematical physics from
after Newton's time, people always ask the following question. </p>
<p>They say, &quot;Look,
I don't know if I can solve it for every imaginable initial condition.&quot;
It's like saying, even the case of the oscillator, you may not be able to solve
every initial condition, you say, &quot;Let me find a special case where <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i> <i>t)</i>, which
depends on <i>x</i> and on <i>t</i>, has the following simple form: it's a
function of t alone times a function of <i>x</i> alone.&quot; Okay? I want
you to know that no one tells you that every solution to the equation has this
form. You guys have a question about this? Over there. Okay, good. All
right, so this is an assumption. You want to see if maybe there are answers
like this to the problem. The only way to do that is to take their assumed
form, put it into the equation and see if you can find a solution of this
form. Not every solution looks like this. For example, you could write <i>e<sup>(x-t)2</sup></i>.
That's the function of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. But it's not a function of <i>x</i>
times the function of t, you see that? <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> are mixed up
together. You cannot rip it out at the two parts, so it's not the most general
thing that can happen; it's a particular one. Right now, you are eager to get
any solution. You want to say, &quot;Can I do anything? Can I calculate even
in the simplest case what the future is, given the present?&quot; </p>
<p>You're asking,
&quot;Can this happen?&quot; So I'm going to show you now that the equation
does admit solutions of this type. So are you guys with me now on what I'm
trying to do? I'm trying to see if this equation admits solutions of this
form. So let's take that and put it here. Now here's where you've got to do
the math, okay? Take this <i>Y</i>
and put it here and start taking derivatives. Let's do the left hand side
first. Left hand side, I have <i>i<u>&#8463;</u></i>. Then I bring the d by dt to
act on this product. d by dt partial means only time has to be differentiated;
<i>x</i> is to be held constant. That's the partial derivative. That's the
meaning of the partial derivative. It's like an ordinary derivative where the
only variable you'd ever differentiate is the one in the derivative. So the
entire <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> doesn't do
anything. It's like a constant. So you just put that <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> there. Then the
derivative, <i>d by dt</i>, comes here, and I claim it becomes the ordinary
derivative. That's the left hand side. You understand that, why that is true?
Because on a function only of time there's no difference between partial
derivative and ordinary derivative. It's got only one variable. </p>
<p>The other potential
variable this d by dt, doesn't care about so it's just
standing there. That's the left hand side. Now look at the right hand side,
all of this stuff, and imagine putting for this function <i>Y</i> this product form. Is it clear to
you, in the right hand side the situation's exactly the opposite? You've got
all these <i>d by dx's</i> partials, they're only interested in this function
because it's got <i>x</i> dependence. <i>F(t)</i> doesn't do anything. All
the derivatives, they go right through <i>F</i>, so you can write it as <i>F(t)</i>.
Now you have to take the derivative with respect to <i>Y</i>. That looks like <i>d<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i><i>/dx<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>V(x)</i><i>Y</i><i>(x)</i>. If you follow
this, you're almost there, but take your time to understand this. The reason
you write it as a product of two functions is the left hand side is only
interested in differentiating the function <i>F</i>, where it becomes the total
derivative. The right hand side is only taking derivatives with respect to <i>x</i>
so it acts on this part of the function, it depends on <i>x</i>. And all
partial derivatives become total derivatives because if you've got only one
variable, there's no need to write partial derivatives. </p>
<p>This combination I'm
going to write to save some time as <i>H</i><i>Y</i>. Let's just say between you and me it's a
shorthand. <i>H</i><i>Y</i> is a shorthand for
this entire mess here. Don't ask me why it looks like <i>H</i> times <i>Y</i>, where are the derivatives? It is a
shorthand, okay. I don't feel like writing the combination over and over, I
can call it <i>H</i><i>Y</i>. So what equation
do I have now? I have <i>i<u>&#8463;</u></i><i>Y</i><i>(x)dF/dt = F(t)H</i><i>Y</i>, where all I want you to notice, <i>H</i><i>Y</i> depends only on <i>x</i>. It has no
dependence on time. Do you see that? There's nothing here that depends on
time. Okay, now this is a trick which if you learned, you'll be quite pleased,
because you'll find that as you do more and more stuff, at least in physics or
economics or statistics, the trick is a very old trick. The problem is quantum
mechanics, but the mathematics is very old. So what do you do next? You
divide both sides by <i>Y</i><i>F</i>. So I say divide by
<i>F(t)</i><i>Y</i><i>(x)</i>. What do you think
will happen if I divide by <i>F(t)</i>, <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i>? On the left hand side, I say divide by <i>Y</i><i>F</i> and the right hand
side, I say divide by <i>Y</i><i>F</i>, can you see that
the <i>Y</i> cancels here, and
you have a 1/<i>F</i>. <i>F</i> cancels here and you have a 1/<i>Y</i>. The equation then says <i>i<u>&#8463;</u></i>(1/<i>F</i>(<i>t))dF/dt
= 1/</i><i>Y</i><i>(x)H</i><i>Y</i><i>.</i> I've written this
very slowly because I don&#39;t know, you'll find this in many advanced books, but
you may not find it in our textbook. </p>
<p>So if you don't
follow something, you should tell me. There's plenty of time to do this, so
I'm in no rush at all. These are purely mathematical manipulations. We have
not done anything involving physics. You all follow this? Yes? Okay. Now
you have to ask yourself the following. I love this argument. Even if you
don't follow this, I'm just going to get it off my chest, it is so clever, and
here is the clever part: this is supposedly a function of time, you agree?
All for a function of time. This is a function of <i>x</i>. This guy doesn't
know what time it is; this guy doesn't know what <i>x</i> is. And yet they're
supposed to be equal. What can they be equal to? They cannot be equal to a
function of time, because then, as you vary time--suppose you think it's a
function of time, suppose. It's not so. Then as time varies, this part is
okay. It can vary with time to match that, but this cannot vary with time at
all, because there is no time here. So this cannot depend on time. And it
cannot depend on <i>x</i>, because if it was a function of <i>x</i> that it was
equal to, as you vary <i>x</i>, this can change with <i>x</i> to keep up with
that. This has no <i>x</i> dependence. It cannot vary with <i>x</i>. So this
thing that they are both equal to is not a function of time and it's not a
function of space. It's a constant. That's all it can be. </p>
<p>So the constant is
going to very cleverly be given the symbol <i>E</i>. We're going to call the
constant <i>E</i>. It turns out <i>E</i> is connected to the energy of the
problem. </p>
<p>So now I have two
equations, this = <i>E</i> and that = <i>E</i> and I'm going to write it down.
So one of them says i <i><u>&#8463;</u> (1/F) dF/dt = E</i>. So let me bring the <i>F</i>
here. Other one says <i>H </i><i>Y</i><i> = E </i><i>Y</i><i>.</i> These two equations, if you solve them, will give you
the solution you are looking for. In other words, going back here, yes, this
equation does admit solutions of this form, of the product form, provided the
function <i>F</i> you put in the product that depends on time obeys this
equation, and the function <i>Y</i>
that depends only on <i>x</i> obeys this equation. Remember, <i>H</i><i>Y</i> is the shorthand for this long bunch
of derivatives. We'll come to that in a moment, but let's solve this equation
first. Now can you guys do this in your head? <i>i<u>&#8463;</u>dF/dt = EF</i>. So
it's saying <i>F</i> is a function of time whose time derivative is the
function itself. Everybody knows what such a function is. It's an
exponential. And the answer is, I'm going to write it down and you can check, <i>F(t)</i>
is <i>F(0) e<sup>&#8722;iEt/<u>&#8463;</u></sup>.</i> If you want now, take the derivative
and check. <i>F(0)</i> is some constant. I call it <i>F(0)</i> because if <i>t
</i>= 0, this goes away and <i>F(t)</i> = <i>F(0)</i>. But take the time
derivative and see. When you take a time derivative of this, you get the same
thing times <i>&#8722;iE/<u>&#8463;</u></i>, and when you multiply by <i>+i<u>&#8463;</u></i>,
everything cancels except <i>EF</i>. So this is a very easy solution. So
let's stop and understand. It says that if you are looking for solutions that
are products of <i>F(t)</i> times <i>f(x</i>), <i>F(t)</i> necessarily is this
exponential function, which is the only function you can have. But now once
you pick that <i>E</i>, you can pick <i>E</i> to be whatever you like, but then
you must also solve this equation at the same time. But what is this
equation. This says-<i><u>&#8463;</u><sup>2</sup>/2md<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i><i>/dx<sup>2</sup> + V</i><i>Y</i><i> = E</i><i>Y</i>, and you guys know who that is,
right? What is it? What can you say about the function that satisfies that
equation? Have you seen it before? Yes? What is it?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Schr&#246;dinger
equation.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It's the state of definite energy. Remember, we said functions of definite
energy obey that equation. So that <i>Y</i>
is really just <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>. So now I'll put
these two pieces together, and this is where those of you who drifted off can
come back, because what I'm telling you is that the Schr&#246;dinger equation in
fact admits a certain solution which is a product of a function of time and a
function of space. And what we found by fiddling around with it is that <i>F(t)
</i>and <i>Y</i> are very special,
and <i>F(t)</i> must look like e<sup>&#8722;iEt/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup>, and <i>Y</i> is just our friend, <i>Y</i> <i><sub>E</sub>(x),</i> which are
functions associated with a definite energy. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is it possible
that there are other solutions, <i>x</i>/<i>Y</i><i>(x,</i> <i>t)</i> that don't satisfy the conditions?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, the question is, are there other solutions for which this factorized form
is not true? Yes, and I will put you out of your suspense very soon by talking
about that. But I want everyone to understand that you can at least solve one
case of Schr&#246;dinger's equation. So what does this mean? I want you guys to
think about it. This says if you start <i>Y</i>
in some arbitrary configuration, that's my initial state, let it evolve with
time, it obeys this rather crazy, complicated Schr&#246;dinger equation. But if I
start it at <i>t</i> = 0, in a state which is a state of definite energy,
namely a state obeying that equation. Then its future is very simple. All you
do is attach this phase factor, <i>e<sup>&#8722;iEt/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>. Therefore
it's not a generic solution, because you may not in general start with a state
which is a state of definite energy. You'll start with some random <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and it's made up of
many, many <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>'s that come in the
expansion of that <i>Y</i>, so it's not going
to always work. But if you picked it so that there's only one such term in the
sum over <i>E</i>, namely one such function, then the future is given by this.
</p>
<p>For example, if you
have a particle in a box, you remember the wave function <i>Y</i><sub>n</sub> looks like square
root of <i>2/Lsine(n</i><i>p</i><i>x/L).</i> An arbitrary <i>Y</i> doesn't look like any of these.
These guys, remember, are nice functions that do many oscillations. But if you
chose it initially to be exactly the sine function, for example, <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, then I claim as
time evolves, the future state is just this initial sine function times this
simple exponential. </p>
<p>This behavior is very
special and it called normal modes. It's a very common idea in mathematical
physics. It's the following: it's very familiar even before you did quantum
mechanics. Take a string tied at both ends and you pluck the string and you
release it. Most probably if you pluck it at one point, you'll probably pull
it in the middle and let it go. That's the initial <i>Y</i><i>(x,t</i>), this time for a
string. Pull it in the middle, let it go. There's an equation that determines
the evolutions of that string. I remind you what that equation is. It's <i>d<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i><i> /dx<sup>2</sup>=(1/velocity<sup>2</sup>)d<sup>2</sup></i><i>Y</i><i> /dt<sup>2</sup></i>. That's the wave
equation for a string. It's somewhat different from this problem, because it's
a second derivative in time that's involved. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, here is
an amazing property of this equation, derived by similar methods. If you pull
a string like this and let it go, it will go crazy when you release it. I
don't even know what it will do. It will do all kinds of things, stuff will go
back and forth, back and forth. But if you can deform the string at <i>t</i> =
0 to look exactly like this, <i>sine(</i><i>p</i><i>x/L)</i> times a number <i>A</i>, that's not easy to do. Do you
understand that to produce the initial profile, one hand is not enough, two
hands are not enough? You've got to get infinite number of your friends, who
are infinitesimally small. You line them up along the string until each
one--tell the person here to pull it exactly this height. Person here has to
pull it exactly that height. You all lift your hands up, then I follow you.
You follow this perfect sine. Then you let go. What do you think will happen
then? What do you think will be the subsequent evolution of the string? Do
you have any guess? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It will go up and down, and the future of that string will look like cosine(<i>p</i><i>xvt/L</i>). Look at it. This
is a time dependence, that <i>t</i> = 0, this goes away, this initial state.
But look what happens at a later time. Every point <i>x</i> rises and falls
with the same period. It goes up and down all together. That means a little
later it will look like that, a little later it will look like that, then it
will look like this, then it will look like this, then it will look like that,
then it will go back and forth. But at every instant, this guy, this guy, this
guy are all rescaled by the same amount from the starting value. That's called
a normal mode. Now your question was, are there other solutions to the
string? Of course. Typically, if you don't think about it and pluck the
string, your initial state will be a sum of these normal modes, and that will
evolve in a complicated way. But if you engineered it to begin exactly this
way, or in any one of those other functions where you put an extra n here, they
all have the remarkable property that they rise and fall in step. </p>
<p>What we have found
here is in the quantum problem, if you start the system in that particular
configuration, then its future has got a single time dependence common to it.
That's the meaning of the factorized solution. So we know one simple example.
Take a particle in a box. If it's in the lowest energy state or ground state
the wave function looks like that. Then the future of that will be <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>x</i> and t will
be the <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i> times <i>e<sup>-iE1t/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>,
where <i>E<sub>1</sub></i> = <i><u>&#8463;</u><sup>2</sup></i><i>p</i><i><sup>2</sup></i><i>1<sup>2</sup>/2mL<sup>2</sup>.
</i>That's
the energy associated with that function. That's how it will oscillate. </p>
<p>Now you guys follow
what I said now, with an analogy with the string and the quantum problem?
They're slightly different equations. One is second order, one is first
order. One has cosines in it, one has exponentials in it. But the common
property is, this is also a function of time times the function of space.
Here, this is a function of time and a function of space. </p>
<p>Okay, so I'm going to
spend some time analyzing this particular function. <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and <i>t = e<sup>&#8722;iEt/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i><sup>
</sup><i>Y</i> <i><sub>E</sub>(x)</i>.
And I'm going to do an abuse in rotation and give the subscript <i>E</i> to
this guy also. What I mean to tell you by that is, this <i>Y</i>, which solves Schr&#246;dinger
equation--by the way, I invite you to go check it. Take the <i>Y</i>, put it into Schr&#246;dinger equation and
you will find it works. In the notes I've given you, I merely tell you that
this is a solution to Schr&#246;dinger's equation. I don't go through this argument
of assuming it's a product form and so on. That's optional. I don't care if
you remember that or not, but this solves Schr&#246;dinger equation, and I call it <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub> because the function
of the right hand side are identified with states of definite energy. </p>
<p>Okay, what will
happen if you measure various quantities in this state? For example, what's the
position going to be? What's the probability for definite position? What's
the probability for definite momentum? What's the probability for definite
anything? How will they vary with time? I will show you, nothing depends on
time. You can say, &quot;How can nothing depend on time? I see time in the
function here.&quot; But it will go away. </p>
<p>Let us ask, what is
the probability that the particle is at <i>x</i> at time t for a solution like
this? You know, the answer is <i>Y</i><i> &#42;(x,t) </i><i>Y</i><i>(x,t),</i> and what do you get when you do that? You
will get <i>Y</i><i><sub>E</sub></i><i>&#42;(x)</i><i>Y</i><i> <sub>E</sub>(x).</i> Then you will get
the absolute value of this guy squared, e<i><sup>iEt</sup></i><sup> </sup>times
e<i><sup>-iEt</sup></i>, and that's just 1. I hope all of you know that this <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><sup>
</sup>absolute value squared is 1. So it does not depend on time. Even though
<i>Y</i> depends on time, <i>Y</i> &#42;<i>Y</i> has no time dependence. That means the
probability for finding that particle will not change with time. That means if
you start the particle in the ground state, <i>Y</i>, and let's say <i>Y</i><sup>2</sup> in fact looks pretty
much the same, it's a real function, this probability does not change with
time. That means you can make a measurement any time you want for position,
and the odds don't change with time. </p>
<p>It's very
interesting. It depends on time and it doesn't depend on time. It's a lot
like <i>e<sup>ipx/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>. It seems to depend on <i>x</i> but the
density does not depend on <i>x</i> because the exponential goes away.
Similarly, it does depend on time. Without the time dependence, it won't
satisfy Schr&#246;dinger equation, but the minute you take the absolute value, this
goes away. That means for this particle, I can draw a little graph that looks
like this, and that is the probability cloud you find in all the textbooks.
Have you seen the probability cloud? They've got a little atom that's a little
fuzzy stuff all around it. They are the states of the hydrogen atom or some
other atom. How do you think you get that? You solve a similar equation,
except it will be in 3 dimensions instead of 1 dimension, and for <i>V(x),</i>
you write <i>-Ze<sup>2</sup>/r,</i> if you want <i>r</i> as <i>x<sup>2</sup> +
y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>. Ze</i> is the nuclear charge, and -<i>e</i> is
the electron charge. You put that in and you solve the equation and you will
find a whole bunch of solutions that behave like this. They are called
stationary states, because in that stationary state--see, if a hydrogen atom
starts out in this state, which is a state of definite energy, as time goes by,
nothing happens to it essentially. Something trivial happens; it picks up the
phase factor, but the probability for finding the electron never changes with
time. So if you like, you can draw a little cloud whose thickness, if you
like, measures the probability for finding it at that location. </p>
<p>So that will have all
kinds of shape. It looks like dumbbells, pointing to the north pole, south
pole, maybe uniformly spherical distribution. They're all the probability of
finding the electron in that state, and it doesn't change with time. So a
hydrogen atom, when you leave it alone, will be in one of these allowed
states. You don't need the hydrogen atom; this particle in a box is a good
enough quantum system. If you start it like that, it will stay like that; if
you start it like that, it will stay like that, times that phase factor. So
stationary states are important, because that's where things have settled down.
</p>
<p>Okay, now you should
also realize that that's not a typical situation. Suppose you have in 1
dimension, there's a particle on a hill, and at <i>t </i>= 0, it's given by
some wave function that looks like this. So it's got some average position,
and if you expand it in terms of exponentials of <i>p</i>, it's got some range
of momenta in it. What will happen to this as a function of time? Can you
make a guess? Let's say it's right now got an average momentum to the left.
What do you think will happen to it? Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It will move to
the left.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It will move to the left. Except for the fuzziness, you can apply your
classical intuition. It's got some position, maybe not precise. It's got some
momentum, maybe not precise, but when you leave something on top of a hill,
it's going to slide down the hill. The average <i>x</i> is going to go this
way, and the average momentum will increase. So that's a situation where the
average of the physical quantities change with time. That's because this state
is not a function <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub><i>(x</i>). It's some random
function you picked. Random functions you picked in some potential will in
fact evolve with time in such a way that measurable quantities will change with
time. The odds for <i>x</i> or the odds for <i>p</i>, odds for everything
else, will change with time, okay? So stationary states are very privileged,
because if you start them that way, they stay that way, and that's why when you
look at atoms, they typically stay that way. But once in a while, an atom will
jump from one stationary state to another one, and you can say that looks like
a contradiction. If it's stationary, what's it doing jumping from here to
there? You know the answer to that? Why does an atom ever change then? If
it's in a state of definite <i>E</i>, it should be that way forever. Why do
they go up and down? Want to guess?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That&#39;s correct. So she said by absorbing photons. And what I really mean by
that is, this problem <i>V(x)</i> involves only the coulomb force between the
electron and the proton. If that's all you have, an electron in the field of a
proton, it will pick one of these levels, it can stay there forever. When you
shine light, you're applying an electromagnetic field. The electric field and
magnetic field apply extra forces in the charge and <i>V(x)</i> should change
to something else. So that this function is no longer a state of definite
energy for the new problem, because you've changed the rules of the game. You
modified the potential. Then of course it will move around and it will change
from one state to another. But an isolated atom will remain that way forever.
But it turns out even that's not exactly correct. You can take an isolated
atom, in the first excited state of hydrogen, you come back a short time later,
you'll find the fellow has come down. And you say, &quot;Look, I didn't turn
on any electric field. <i>E</i> = 0, <i>B</i> = 0. What made the atom come
down?&quot; Do you know what the answer to that is? Any rumors? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Photon emission?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Its photon is emitted, but you need an extra thing, extra electrical magnetic
field to act on it before it will emit the photon. But where is the field?
I've turned everything off. <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> are both 0. So it turns out
that the state <i>E</i> = <i>B</i> = 0 is like a state say in a harmonic
oscillator potential <i>x = p</i> = 0, sitting at the bottom of the well. We
know that's not allowed in quantum mechanics. You cannot have definite <i>x</i>
and definite <i>p</i>. It turns out in quantum theory, <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> are
like <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>. That means the state of definite <i>E</i> is not a
state of definite <i>B</i>. A state of definite <i>B</i> is not a state of
definite <i>E</i>. It looks that way in the macroscopic world, because the
fluctuations in <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> are very small. Therefore, just like in
the lowest energy state, an oscillator has got some probability to be jiggling
back and forth in <i>x</i> and also in <i>p</i>. The vacuum, which we think
has no <i>E</i> and no <i>B</i>, has small fluctuations, because <i>E</i> and <i>B</i>
both vanishing is like <i>x</i> and <i>p</i> both vanishing. Not allowed. So
you've got to have a little spread in both <i>E</i> and both <i>B</i>. They're
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. </p>
<p>So that's a theory of
nothing. The vacuum you think is the most uninteresting thing, and yet it is
not completely uninteresting, because it's got these fluctuations. It's those
fluctuations that tickle the atom and make it come from an excited state to a
ground state. Okay, so unless you tamper with the atom in some fashion, it
will remain in a stationary state. Those states are states of definite
energy. They are found by solving the Schr&#246;dinger equation without time in it.
<i>H</i> <i>Y</i> = <i>E</i> <i>Y</i> is called the time independent
Schr&#246;dinger equation, and that's what most of us do most of the time. The
problem can be more complicated. It can involve two particles, can involve ten
particles. It may not involve this force, may involve another force, but
everybody is spending most of his time or her time solving the Schr&#246;dinger
equation to find states of definite energy, because that's where things will
end up. </p>
<p>All right, I've only
shown you that the probability to find different positions doesn&#39;t change with
time. I will show you the probability to find different anything doesn't change
with time. Nothing will change with time, not just <i>x</i> probability, so
I'll do one more example. Let's ask, what's the probability to find a momentum
<i>p</i>? What are we supposed to do? We're supposed to take e<i><sup>ipx</sup></i><sup>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i>
</sup>times the function at some time <i>t</i> and do that integral. I'm
sorry, you should take that and do that integral, and then you take the
absolute value of that. And that's done at every time. You take the absolute
value and that's the probability to get momentum <i>p</i>, right? The recipe
was, if you want the probability, take the given function, multiply to the
conjugate of <i>Y</i><i><sub>p </sub></i>and do the integral, <i>dL</i>
and <i>dx</i>. <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>t) in general has got
complicated time dependence, but not our <i>Y</i>.
Remember our <i>Y</i>? Our <i>Y</i> looks like <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> times e<i><sup>
&#8722;iEt/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>. But when you take the absolute value, this has
nothing to do with <i>x</i>. You can pull it outside the integral--or let me
put it another way. Let's do the integral and see what you get. You will find
<i>A<sub>p</sub></i> looks like <i>A<sub>p</sub>(0)e<sup>&#8722;iEt/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>.
Do you see that? If the only thing that happens to <i>Y</i> is that you get an extra factor at
later times, only thing that happens to the <i>A<sub>p</sub></i> is it gets the
extra factor at later times. But the probability to find momentum <i>p</i> is
the absolute value square of that, and in the absolute value process, this guy
is gone. You follow that? Since the wave function changes by a simple phase
factor, the coefficient to have a definite momentum also changes by the same
phase factor.This is called a phase factor, exponential of modulus 1, but when
you take the absolute value, the guy doesn't do anything. </p>
<p>Now you can replace <i>p</i>
by some other variable. It doesn&#39;t matter. The story is always the same. So
a state of definite energy seems to evolve in time, because e<i><sup>ipx</sup></i><sup>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup>,
but none of the probabilities change with time. It's absolutely stationary.
Just put anything you measure. That's why those states are very important.
Okay, now I want to caution you that not every solution looks like this. That's
the question you raised. I'm going to answer that question now. Let's imagine
that I find two solutions to the Schr&#246;dinger equation of this form. Solution <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> looks like <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>(x,t), looks like e<i><sup>ipx</sup></i><sup>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i>
</sup><i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub>E1</sub>(x). That's one
solution for energy E<sub>1</sub>. Then there's another solution, <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub><i>(x)</i> looks like e<i><sup>ipx</sup></i><sup>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup><i>Y</i> <sub>E2</sub>(x). This function has
all the properties I mentioned, namely nothing depends on time. That has the
same property. But because the Schr&#246;dinger equation is a linear equation, it's
also true that this <i>Y</i>, which is <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, add this one to
this one, is also a solution. </p>
<p>I think I have done
it many, many times. If you take a linear equation, <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> obeys the
Schr&#246;dinger equation, <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> obeys the
Schr&#246;dinger equation. Add the left hand side to the left hand side and right
hand side to the right hand side, you will find that if <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> obeys it and <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> does, <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> also obeys it. Not
only that, it can be even more general. You can multiply this by any number, <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>(x,t), any constant, <i>A</i><sub>2</sub><i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>x</i>,t), but <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>
and <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> don't depend on time. Also, obeys Schr&#246;dinger
equation. Can you see that? That's superposition of solutions. It's a
property of linear equations. Nowhere does <i>Y</i><sup>2</sup> appear in the Schr&#246;dinger equation, therefore
you can add solutions. But take a solution of this form. Even though <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> is a product of some
<i>F</i> and a <i>Y</i>, and <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> is a product of some
<i>F</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, the sum is not a
product of some <i>F</i> and some <i>Y</i>.
You cannot write it as a product, you understand? That's a product, and that's
a product, but their sum is not a product, because you cannot pull out a common
function of time from the two of them. They have different time dependence.
But that is also a solution. </p>
<p>In fact, now you can
ask yourself, what is the most general solution I can build in this problem?
Well, I think you can imagine that I can now write <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and <i>t</i> as <i>A</i><sub>E</sub><i>Y</i> <sub>E</sub>(<i>x,t</i>), sum over
all the allowed <i>E</i>s. That also satisfies Schr&#246;dinger equation. Do you
agree? Every term in it satisfies Schr&#246;dinger equation. You add them all up,
multiply by any constant <i>A</i><sub>E</sub>, that also satisfies Schr&#246;dinger
equation. So now I'm suddenly manufacturing more complicated solutions. The
original modest goal was to find a product form, but once you got the product
form, you find if you add them together, you get a solution that's no longer a
product of <i>x</i> and a product of <i>t</i>, function of <i>x</i> and a
function of <i>t</i>, because this guy has one time dependence; another term is
a different time dependence. You cannot pull them all out. So we are now
manufacturing solutions that don't look like their products. This is the
amazing thing about solving the linear equation. You seem to have very modest
goals when you start with a product form, but in the end, you find that you can
make up a linear combination of products. Then the only question is, will it
cover every possible situation you give me? In other words, suppose you come
to me with an arbitrary initial state. I don't know anything about it, and you
say, &quot;What is its future?&quot; Can I handle that problem? </p>
<p>And the answer is, I
can, and I'll tell you why that is true. <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and t looks like <i>A</i><sub>E</sub>. I'm
going to write this more explicitly as <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>(x)e<sup>-<i>ipx</i>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup>. Look at this
function now at <i>t</i> = 0. At <i>t</i> = 0, I get <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and 0 to be &#931;A<sub>E</sub><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>(<i>x)</i>. In other
words, I can only handle those problems whose initial state looks like this.
But my question is, should I feel limited in any way by the restriction? Do
you follow what I'm saying? Maybe I'll say it one more time. This is the most
general solution I'm able to manufacture that looks like this, <i>A</i><sub>E</sub><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>(x)e<sup>-<i>ipx</i>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup>.
It's a sum over solution to the product form with variable, each one with a
different coefficient. That's also a solution to Schr&#246;dinger equation. If I
take that solution and say, &quot;What does it do at <i>t</i> = 0?&quot; I find
it does the following. At <i>t</i> = 0, it looks like this. So only for
initial functions of this form I have the future. But the only is not a big
only, because every function you can give me at <i>t</i> = 0 can always be
written in this form. It's a mathematical result that says that just like sines
and cosines and certain exponentials are a complete set of functions for
expanding any function. The mathematical theory tells you that the solutions
of H <i>Y</i> = E <i>Y</i>, if you assemble all of them, can be
used to build up an arbitrary initial function. That means any initial
function you give me, I can write this way, and the future of that initial
state is this guy. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. Lots of mathematical restrictions, single valued. Physicists usually
don't worry about those restrictions till of course they get in trouble. Then
we go crawling back to the math guys to help us out. So just about anything
you can write down, by the way physics works, things tend to be continuous and
differentiable. That's the way natural things are. So for any function we can
think of it is true. You go the mathematicians, they will give you a function
that is nowhere continuous, nowhere differentiable, nowhere defined, nowhere
something. That's what makes them really happy. But they are all functions
the way they've defined it, but they don't happen in real life, because
whatever happens here influences what happens on either side of it, so things
don't change in a discontinuous way. Unless you apply an infinite force, an infinite
potential, infinite something, everything has got what's called C infinity, can
differentiate any number of times. So we don't worry about the restriction.
So in the world of physicists' functions, you can write any initial function in
terms of these functions. </p>
<p>So let me tell you
then the process for solving the Schr&#246;dinger equation under any conditions.
Are you with me? You come and give me <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i> 0), and you say, &quot;As a function of time, where is
it going to end up?&quot; That's your question. That's all you can ask.
Initial state, final state. This is given, this is needed. So I'll give you a
3 step solution. </p>
<p>Step 1, find <i>A<sub>E</sub>=
</i><i>Y</i><i><sub>E</sub></i><i>&#42;(x)</i><i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>0). Step 2, <i>Y</i><i>(x)</i> and <i>t</i> = this <i>A</i><sub>E
</sub>that you got times e<sup>-<i>ipx</i>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup><i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>(<i>x</i>). So what
I'm telling you is, the fate of a function <i>Y</i> with the wiggles and jiggles is very
complicated to explain. Some wiggle goes into some other wiggle that goes into
some other wiggle as a function of time, but there is a basic simplicity
underlying that evolution. The simplicity is the following. If at <i>t</i> = 0
you expand your <i>Y</i> as such a sum, where
the coefficients are given by the standard rule, then as time goes away from <i>t</i>
= 0, all you need to do is to multiply each coefficient by the particular term
involving that particular energy. And that gives you the <i>Y</i> at later times. A state of definite
energy in this jargon will be the one in which every term is absent except 1,
maybe <i>E = E<sub>1</sub></i>. That is the kind we study. That state has got
only 1 term in the sum and its time evolution is simply given by this and all
probabilities are constant. But if you mix them up with different
coefficients, you can then handle any initial condition. </p>
<p>So we have now solved
really for the future of any quantum mechanical problem. So I'm going to give
you from now to the end of class concrete examples of this. But I don't mind
again answering your questions, because it's very hard for me to put myself in
your place. So I'm trying to remember when I did not know quantum mechanics,
sitting in some sandbox and some kid was throwing sand in my face. So I don't
know. I've lost my innocence and I don't know how it looks to you. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> For each of these
problems, you have to solve that equation you gave us before to find the form
of the <i>Y</i><sub>E</sub>, right?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. So let's do the following problem. Let us take a world in which
everything is inside the box of length <i>L</i>. And someone has manufactured
for you a certain state. Let me come to that case in a minute. Let me take a
simple case then I'll build up the situation you want. Let's first take a
simple case where at <i>t</i> = 0 <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>0) = the square root of 2/<i>L</i>sine(<i>n</i><i>p</i><i>x/L</i>). That is just a
function with n oscillations. You agree, that's a state of definite energy.
The energy of that state, <i>E<sub>n</sub></i>, is <i><u>&#8463;</u></i><sup>2</sup><i>p</i><sup>2</sup>n<sup>2</sup>/ 2<i>mL</i><sup>2</sup>.
We did that last time. And the reason, why were we so interested in these
functions? Now I can tell you why. If this is my initial state, let me take a
particular <i>n</i>, then the state at any future time, <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>t), is very simple
here, the square root of <i>2/Lsine(n</i><i>p</i><i>x/L),</i> times e<sup>-<i>ipx</i>/<i><u>&#8463;</u></i></sup>, where
energy is <i>n<sup>2</sup></i><i>p</i><i><sup>2</sup></i><i><u>&#8463;</u></i><i><sup>2</sup></i><i>/2mL<sup>2</sup></i>. That's it. That
is the function of time. All I've done to that initial state is multiply by <i>e<sup>-iEt</sup></i>,
but <i>E</i> is not some random number. <i>E</i> is labeled by <i>n</i> and E<sub>n</sub>is
whatever you have here. That's the time dependence of that state. </p>
<p>It's very clear that
if you took the absolute value of this <i>Y</i>,
this guy has absolute value = 1 at all times. It's like saying cos <i>t</i>
depends on time, sine <i>t</i> depends on time, but cos<sup>2</sup> + sine<sup>2</sup>,
cos<sup>2 </sup><i>t</i> + sine<sup>2</sup> <i>t</i> seems to depend on time,
but it doesn't. So this seems to depend on time and it does, but when you take
the absolute value, it goes away. That's the simplest problem. I gave you an
initial state, the future is very simple, attach the factor. </p>
<p>Now let's give you a
slightly more complicated state. The more complicated state will be--I'm going
to hide that for now. Let us take a <i>Y</i><i>(x,</i>0) that looks like 3 times square root of 2/<i>L</i>sine(<i>2</i><i>p</i><i>x/L</i>) + 4 times sine...
This is my initial state. What does it look like? It's a sum of 2 energy
states. This guy is what I would call <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> in my notation, the second highest state. This guy is <i>Y</i><sub>3</sub>. Everybody is
properly normalized, and these are the <i>A</i>s. So this state, if you
measure its energy, what will you get? Anybody tell me what answers I can get
if I measure energy now? You want to guess what are the possible energies I
could get? Yes. Any of you, either of you. Can you tell? No? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You can get <u>h</u><sup>2</sup><i>p</i><sup>2</sup> times 4/2<i>mL</i><sup>2</sup>,
or times 9.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
So her answer was, you can get in my convention <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>or <i>E</i><sub>3</sub>,
just put <i>n</i> = to 2 0r 3 That's all you have, your function written as a
sum over <i>Y</i><sub>E </sub>is only 2 terms.
That means they are the only 2 energies you can get. So it's not a state of
definite energy. You can get either this answer or this answer. But now you
can sort of see, it's more likely to get this guy, because it has a 4 in front
of it, and less likely to get this guy, and impossible to get anything else.
So the probability for getting <i>n</i> = 2 is proportional to 3<sup>2</sup>,
and the probability for getting <i>n</i> = 3 is proportional to 4<sup>2</sup>.
If you want the absolute probabilities, then you can write it as 3<sup>2</sup>
divided by 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>, which is 4<sup>2</sup>, or you can
write it as 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> is 5<sup>2</sup>. See, if you square
these probabilities, you get 25, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>. If you want to
get 1, I think you can see without too much trouble, if you rescale the whole
thing by 1 fifth, now you'll find the total probabilities add up to 1. That's
the way to normalize the function, that's the easy way. </p>
<p>The hard way is to
square all of this and integrate it and then set it = to 1 and see what you
have to do. In the end, all you will have to do is divide by 5. I'm just
giving you a shortcut. When you expand the <i>Y</i> in terms of normalized functions, then the
coefficient squared should add up to 1. If they don't, you just divide them by
whatever it takes. So this has got a chance 3 is to 5 of being this or that
energy. But as a function of time, you will find here things vary with time.
This is not going to be time independent. I want to show you that. So <i>Y</i><i>(x,t)</i> now is going to be
(3/5&#8730;(2/<i>L</i>))sine(<i>2</i><i>p</i><i>x/L</i>) times e<i><sup>&#8722;i(E2)</sup></i>. I don't want to write
the full formula for <i>E</i><sub>n </sub>every time. I'm just going to call
it <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>, + (4/5&#8730;(2/<i>L</i>))sine (3<i>p</i><i>x/L</i>) times e<i><sup>&#8722;i(E3)t/<u>&#8463;</u>.
</sup></i>Now you notice that if I found the probability to be at sum <i>x</i>,
p(x,t), I have to take the absolute square of all of this. And all I want you
to notice is that the absolute square of all of this, you cannot drop these
exponentials now. If you've got two of them, you cannot drop them, because
when you take <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> absolute squared, <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, you multiply it by <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub> conjugate + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> conjugate, let's do
that. So you want to multiply the whole thing by its conjugate. </p>
<p>So first you take the
absolute square of this. You will get (9/25)(2/<i>L</i>)sin<sup>2</sup>(2<i>p</i><i>x/L</i>). And the absolute
value of this is just 1. You see that? That is <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>&#42;<i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>. Then you must take
<i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>&#42; <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>. That will be 16/25&#8730;(2/L)--I'm
sorry, no square root&#8211;2/Lsin<sup>2</sup>(3<i>p</i>x/L) times 1, because the absolute value of
this guy with itself is 1. But that's not the end. You've got 2 more terms
which look like <i>Y<sub>1</sub></i><sup>&#42;</sup><i>Y</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>&#42;<i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>. I'm not going to
work out all the details, but let me just show you that time dependence
exists. So if you take <i>Y<sub>1</sub></i><sup>&#42;</sup><i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, you will get (3/5&#8730;(2/<i>L</i>))sine(<i>2</i><i>p</i><i>x/L</i>) times e<i><sup>+iE2t/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i><sup>
</sup>times--sorry. 3/5 times (4/5&#8730;(2/<i>L</i>))sine (3<i>p</i><i>x/L</i>) times e<i><sup>(i(E2)&#8722;i(E3)t)/<u>&#8463;</u></sup></i>
+ 1 more term. I don't care about any of these things. I'm asking you to see,
do things depend on time or not? This has no time dependence because the
absolute value of that vanished. This has no time
dependence, the absolute value of this vanished. </p>
<p>But the cross terms,
when you multiply the conjugate of this by this, or the conjugate of this by
that, they don't cancel. That's all I want you to know. So I'll get a term
like this + this complex conjugate. I don't want to write that in detail. If
you combine this function with the conjugate, you'll find this + the conjugate
will give me a cosine. So I should probably write it on another part of the
board. So maybe I don't even want to write it because it's in the notes. I
want you to notice the following: look at the first term, no time dependence,
second term, no time dependence. The cross term has an e to the something and
I claim the other cross term will have e to the - something. e to the <i>i</i>
something or e to the -<i>i</i> something is the cosine of something. That's
all I want you to know. So there is somewhere in the time dependence <i>P(x,t)</i>
that's got a lot of stuff which is t independent, + something that looks like a
whole bunch of numbers, times cosine(<i>E<sub>2</sub> - E<sub>3</sub>)t /<u>&#8463;</u></i>.
That's all I want you to notice. That means the probability density will be
oscillating. The particle will not be fixed; it will be bouncing back and
forth between the walls. And the rate at which it bounces is given by the
difference in energy between the two states you formed in the combination. </p>
<p>So this is how a
particle in general--if you want, not the most general one, but it's a
reasonably general case where you added some mixture of that--let me see. You
added 2 to 3. You added that state + that state. You added 4 times fifth of
that times 3 fifths of that as the initial condition. Okay? 4
fifths of this one guy with 2 wiggles and 3 fifths with 3 wiggles
and you let it go in time, you will find then if you add these time
dependences, there'll be a part that varies with time. So the density will not
be constant now. It will be sloshing back and forth in the box. That's a more
typical situation. So not every state, initial state, is a function of a state
of definite energy. It's an admixture. I've taken the simplest case where the
admixture has only 2 parts in it. You can imagine taking a function made of 3
parts and 4 parts and 10 parts and when you square them and all that, you'll
get 100 cross terms. They'll all be oscillating at different rates. But the
frequencies will always be given by the difference in frequencies, differences
in energies that went into your mixture. </p>
<p>The last problem
which I'm not going to do now, I'll do next time, but I'll tell you what it is
I want to do, which is really this mathematically more involved, but the idea
is the same. Here I gave you the initial state on a plate. I just said, here
it is, 3 fifths times 1 function of definite energy, 4 fifths times another
function of definite energy. The problem you really want to be able to solve
right now is when somebody gives you an arbitrary initial state and says,
&quot;What happens to it?&quot; So I'm going to consider next time a function
that looks something like this: <i>x</i> times 1 - <i>x</i> is my function at
time 0. That's a nice function, because it vanishes at 0, it vanishes at 1.
It's a box of length <i>L</i> = 1. It's an allowed initial state. Then I can
ask, what does this do. So you should think about how do I predict its future,
what's involved? So you will see that in the notes. So what I'm going to do
next time is to finish this problem and give you the final set of postulates,
so that you can see what the rules of quantum mechanics are.</p>
