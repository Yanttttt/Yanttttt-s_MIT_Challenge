<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> This is a relatively simple
topic. In fact, any of you who took any kind of high school physics,
you would have done this thing with fluids. So, this is the subject for
today. Fluid dynamics and statics. So, I'll start with the simple
static problem. We are going to take--Whenever I say fluid, you are
free to imagine water or oil. That's the--that's a good enough example
of a fluid. One important property of the fluid, the density, denoted
by <i>ρ</i>; the density of water I would probably note by a subscript
<i>w</i>. And you know that's mass per unit volume. For water that
happens to be 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter. So, let's not linger
there. I think that's a fairly simple concept.</p>

<p>The more subtle concept is the one of pressure. So, you have the
notion of a pressure if you go in a swimming pool and you dive down to
the bottom, you know, the pressure is going up. So, what's the formal
definition of pressure? Is it a vector? Is it a scale? Or does it have
magnitude? Does it have a direction? That's what I want to explain to
you. So, you can pick a point on the fluid, there, and say the pressure
there is such and such. But what do we mean by that? We mean by that
the following. If you get into that fluid and you want to carve out a
little space for yourself, you know, make a little cube, maybe a glass
cube, and you want to live inside that cube. So, I'm going to blow up
the cube like this. The water is trying to push you in from all sides
and compress this cube. You therefore have to push out on the two, on
all the walls. If the force you exert on this wall is some <i>F</i> and
the area of that wall is <i>A</i>, that ratio is called a pressure. So,
pressure is an intensive measure of how hard the water is trying to
push in. If you don't put the cube, that pressure is still there, but
one way to measure the pressure is to try to go in there and push the
fluid out and ask how hard does it push you. And the unit for pressure
Newton per meters square--and we use another name for that called a
Pascal. One Pascal is one Newton per meter squared.</p>

<p>Here's another example of pressure. You have a gas. We'll do a lot
of this after the break. There is a gas inside a cylinder. There's a
piston. Now, if the pressure of the gas and the pressure of the outside
world are the same, there's nothing you have to do, assuming the piston
is massless. But if you want to increase the pressure in the gas, you
put some extra weight. That <i>mg</i> will push down, and <i>mg</i>
divided by the area of the piston will be extra pressure you apply.
That's also the pressure of the gas. That pressure is the atmospheric
pressure, plus the extra weight you apply, divided by the area of this
piston. The atmospheric pressure is everywhere. So, when you push down
on the piston here to compress the gas further, you're adding to the
atmospheric pressure this extra force divided by area. Sometimes--I
mean, this is called the absolute pressure. And that's called the
atmospheric pressure, and that's called the gauge pressure. So, the
gauge pressure is the pressure on top of atmospheric pressure. For
example, when your car has a flat, the bright side of it is the
pressure inside the tire is in fact equal to atmospheric pressure. It
doesn't help you because there's a pressure inside and there's a
pressure outside, and if you want to keep your car moving, you really
have to increase the pressure in the tire. And when you stick this
gauge in and you measure something, 32 pounds per square inch, that's
the gauge pressure. That's in excess of the atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>So, you should understand that the pressure is a condition in a
fluid, and one of the important properties of pressure, is that if you
took a fluid and you went to a certain height, all points at that
height have the same pressure. And we understand that as follows. So, I
go to this fluid. I imagine in my mind a little cylindrical section of
the same fluid. Just draw a dotted line around that region and focus on
that little chunk of fluid and say, "Can the pressure on the two sides
-- this face and that face -- be different?" The answer is "no."
Because if the pressure on the left was bigger than the pressure on the
right, I take a cylinder of some area <i>A</i>, pressure times area on
the left will exceed pressure time area on the right. And therefore,
the fluid should move to the right. But it's not doing anything. It's
in equilibrium, and the only way that can happen is if it's pushed
equally from both sides. So, notice that the pressure on this chunk
from the left points this way, and then that chunk points that way.
They're trying to push it in. So, pressure cannot change at a given
depth.</p>

<p>But let's take a cylinder that looks like this [draws on board].
Remember this is not a real cylinder. This is the same water, and
mentally, I have isolated a part of the water that looks like a
cylinder; maybe you want to draw it in dotted lines. But it's just a
fluid of cylindrical shape, base area <i>A</i> and height <i>h</i>. I
can ask the following question. Let's say <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> is the
measure of that one from the surface, and <i>h<sub>2</sub></i> is the
depth from the surface to the lower face of the cylinder. We can now
argue the pressure in the top and bottom really should not be equal.
You should think about it, by the same argument I gave earlier will
tell me it cannot be equal. If they were equal, since these two areas
are equal, the forces pushing up and pushing down will cancel. With no
net force on the cylinder, you can ask then, "What's keeping the
cylinder of water from falling down?" Well, there has to be a force to
equal the weight of that cylinder. Therefore, there has to be a net
upward force. That means the pressure down here, pushing up, better be
higher than the pressure on the top.</p>

<p>We are now going to calculate what the pressure difference is. So,
let's call the pressure downstairs <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> and upstairs
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>. So, the upward force is <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>
[correction: should have said <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>] times <i>A</i>. The
downward force is <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> [correction: should have said
P<sub>1</sub>] times <i>A</i>. That's the net upward force. That's got
to be equal to the weight of that amount of water. The weight is found
by first the mass, which is area times <i>h<sub>2</sub> -
h<sub>1</sub></i>. That's the volume of the cylinder, times the density
of water or whatever fluid you have. That's the mass of the cylinder.
That's the weight of that cylinder of liquid. All I have done is
balance the gravitational force on this cylinder with the net upward
force due to the different pressures. I think I made one mistake here.
Upward force, in magnitude--I want to write this <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>
times <i>A</i>, and downward force I want to write as
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>. How we keep track of signs is a little subtle.
I'm balancing two magnitudes. I'm balancing net upward force, namely
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> is considered positive upward, and this is the
force of gravity down. I'm balancing the magnitudes. So, the area
cancels out. Because this area -- see the pressure between two points
-- should not depend on the area of this fictitious cylinder I took. In
fact, I find it is equal to <i>ρg</i> times <i>h<sub>2</sub> -
h<sub>1</sub></i>, which is the difference in the depth of these two
points. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> It's actually like a [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Which one?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah. In fact, it really happens
to be normal, or perpendicular to area because the pressure will push
straight up and straight down. How about forces on the sides of
cylinder? They cancel at every height. Because at every height the push
from the left and right are equal; I already showed you that. So, for
the mechanical stability of this chunk, I need all forces to add up to
zero. Horizontally, there is no gravity and the pressure at every
height is equal. So, that cancels out. Vertically, there is the force
of gravity, and it's cancelled by the difference in pressure.</p>

<p>So, we can see that <i>P<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>1</sub></i> plus
<i>ρg</i> times the height difference. And people write this formula as
follows. It's very standard to take <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> to be the
point right at the surface, and <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> to be any point
inside, and to call the depth of that simply as <i>h</i>. Then the
pressure at the point <i>P</i> in the fluid is the pressure at the top,
which is usually atmospheric pressure, plus <i>ρgh</i>. So, I don't
have an <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> and an <i>h<sub>2</sub></i> because
<i>h<sub>1</sub></i> I've chosen to be zero. And <i>h<sub>2</sub></i>
I'm simply calling <i>h</i>. This says something very simple. If you go
to a lake, at the surface of the lake the pressure is due to the
atmosphere. You take a dive, you go down some depth <i>h</i>, the
pressure goes up by this amount. Now, if you go to the bottom of the
ocean, it's going to be an incredible amount of pressure. That's why
you and I cannot survive in the bottom of the ocean, because the
outside pressure -- inside is usual atmospheric pressure -- you're
breathing the air into your lungs, you go down with that. Outside is
atmospheric plus this, and that can kill you. That's why when you build
a submarine, you've got to make sure it can withstand the pressure. But
fish don't have the problem, because fish are breathing the water. The
water is going into their system and outside their system. So, that's
one way for you to live. If you're 20,000 feet under the sea, start
drinking the water. But it's not a long-term solution. It'll work in
the short time because you'll be equalizing the pressure.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, how about the atmospheric pressure? What's the origin of
that? And the origin of the atmospheric pressure is that we are
ourselves living in the bottom of a pool, but it's filled with air. The
air above our heads goes on for maybe 100 miles, but the density
decreases, eventually vanishes. So, I cannot tell you precisely where
the atmosphere ends, but I can say the following. If I go far above
where the absolute pressure is zero, in free space there is just
vacuum. The pressure here is the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric
pressure at the bottom of Earth is equal to zero plus <i>ρgh</i>, where
<i>ρ</i> is the density of air, <i>g</i> is <i>g</i>, and <i>h</i> is
the height of the atmosphere. And that happens to be 10<sup>5</sup>
Pascals. So, we are living in the bottom of a pool where the pressure
is 10<sup>5</sup> Pascals, relative to empty space--interstellar space.
But as I said, that pressure doesn't kills us because the pressure can
be felt both from the outside pushing in and inside going through your
nostrils and everything else, pushing out. But you have all seen the
dramatic experiment where you take a can of something and you heat it
up so the air goes out; then you seal it. The air that's been driven
out reduces the pressure. So, when you seal it and you cool it, then
the pressure drops. And even the drop in pressure--it doesn't even drop
down to zero, but it's big enough for the while can to implode.</p>

<p>Now, let's see what you get here. Let's do the following. This is
<i>ρgh</i>, and you can ask yourself the following question. If this
was a swimming pool, how high would the water be? In other words, what
height of water above the Earth would produce the same pressure as our
atmosphere does? Then I say, if I want 10<sup>5</sup> Pascals, that's
the density of water at 10<sup>3</sup>, <i>g</i>, let's pretend it's
ten. And <i>h</i> is what I'm looking for. Cancel all the powers of 10;
<i>h</i> is like 10 meters. And it turns out it's -- to the best of my
knowledge -- it's 32 feet. These are the units we don't use in the
book, but it's a very common way of thinking, 32 feet. So, we are at
the bottom of a pool. If it was filled with water, it would be 32 feet
of water.</p>

<p>Alright. So, now we are going to take this formula <i>P =
P<sub>0</sub> + ρgh</i> and put it to work. Get some mileage out of
that. So, what are the things we can do with that formula? First thing
you can do is to build yourself a barometer. Barometer you know is a
way to tell what the pressure is today. Now, the atmospheric pressure,
when I said it's 10<sup>5</sup>, that's the typical pressure. It
doesn't really stay locked into the value. Each day there are
fluctuations. That's why the weather person tells you pressure is going
up, pressure is going down. So, let's find a way to measure the
pressure, and here is one way to do that. You take a can of something,
fill it with some liquid, take a test tube. Evacuate it completely,
suck all the air out of it and stick it into this. When you do, there
is a complete vacuum here and the atmosphere is pushing down, so the
fluid will rise up to some height <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>And you can ask, "How high will it go? What's going to be the
height?" Well, it'll go to a height so that zero pressure here, plus
this <i>ρgh</i>, which is the pressure there, will be the same as the
pressure here, because they are two points at the same height. Pressure
here is the atmospheric pressure. So pressure here, atmospheric
pressure, is zero at the top of the tube, plus <i>ρgh</i>. So, if you
build this gadget, this barometer out of water, the water column will
rise to the height of 32 feet. But now, nobody wants a gadget 32-feet
high, so what you use instead is mercury, because it's very dense. So,
you want to get the same atmospheric pressure, but you want to have a
bigger <i>ρ</i> and get a smaller <i>h</i>. If you go look up a book
and find the density of mercury, you're going to find the height is
something like, I don't know, 750, 780 millimeters. That's why the
weather guy says the pressure today is so many millimeters, and the
mercury is dropping. Now, I'm not sure why they bother to give the
numbers, because for most of us, including me, those numbers don't mean
anything. Here's a number, 746 millimeters. Does it speak to you? Not
to me. So it--it speaks to one of you guys?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah. Okay. Some number. It's
not like saying today is 67 degree Fahrenheit. I guess I know what that
means, but when I hear the mercury, I think it's just a waste of time.
Anyway, they're telling you how much the mercury is. Okay? You can use
any fluid you like, but you've got to agree on using mercury because if
it's 760 millimeters, and it's water the person is talking about, of
course you are in serious trouble. So understood, we're talking about
mercury. Also, mercury is used in thermometers. That's the subject for
after the break. So there, the mercury falling could stand for falling
temperatures and rising temperatures, but here it's for falling
pressure and rising pressure. So, this is the first gadget you can
build with what I've taught you.</p>

<p>The next gadget you can build is--you can imagine this--you trying
to drink. This is your ears and nose and what not. You've got a straw
and you're trying to drink something. Now, remember the fluid is water.
Okay? It's not mercury now, because you're doing different experiment.
You're going to drink from a straw. So, how do you do that? You know
when you drink from a straw you create a partial vacuum in your mouth.
So, the pressure here--;So, in the case of the fluid that you want to
drink, this is your head. The pressure here less than the atmosphere.
If it's less than the atmosphere by some amount, then the fluid can
start climbing up to some height, and climb to such a height so that
the lower pressure, plus that <i>ρgh</i> will equal atmospheric
pressure. So, you got to reduce the pressure more and more in your
mouth until this fluid can climb up. If you just--if you want to just
make it to your mouth, it depends on the length of the straw, the
height of the straw. If you want to suck it up a certain height, then
that height, <i>ρgh</i>, plus the pressure in your mouth, is the
pressure here, and that's the atmospheric pressure. So, if you want to
drink water from a well that is more than 32 feet deep, you are out of
luck. Even if your face and your head are a complete vacuum, you cannot
get the water to climb more than 32 feet. So, that's another
illustration of this.</p>

<p>So, one more example of this <i>P = P<sub>0</sub> + ρgh</i>, is if I
give you another fluid, it doesn't mix with water and I tell you find
the density, there are many ways. One is to just find mass and volume
of that fluid and divide. But here is another thing people use. You
take what's called a U-tube. Yeah, that's not--I know, that's where
they post all the embarrassing videos, but this was physics
contribution to pop culture long before any of this happened. This is
the U-tube. And the U-tube, let's say you fill it up with one fluid and
this is the other fluid. So, this is oil, and this is water. If the two
heights were equal, then you know we're talking about the same fluid.
But this is supposed to tell you that oil is less dense than water, and
we can check that by comparing two points in this fluid at the same
height, and saying the pressure must be the same at those points. You
understand how I get that? That pressure and that pressure are equal
because you can draw a cylinder there horizontally, which cannot be
pushed sideways. From here, to this pressure add that <i>ρgh</i> and
that <i>ρgh</i>, and you come to that point; you conclude that pressure
is also equal. You cannot jump into the new fluid here because the
<i>ρ</i> for here and the <i>ρ</i> for this are different. But these
two points have the same pressure and they are in the same fluid. So,
let me write that statement that this pressure and this pressure are
equal by saying, atmospheric pressure is on the top for both of them.
That, plus <i>ρ<sub>1</sub>gh<sub>1</sub></i> is equal to atmospheric
pressure plus <i>ρ<sub>2</sub>,gh<sub>2</sub></i>, where this is the
second fluid , height goes to <i>h<sub>2</sub></i>, first fluid, the
height is equal to <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>, the densities are
<i>ρ<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>ρ<sub>2</sub></i>. Atmospheric pressure is
cancelled; then you find <i>h<sub>1</sub>/h<sub>2</sub> =
ρ<sub>2/</sub>ρ<sub>1</sub></i>. So, by comparing the heights you can
find the relative density. If one of them is water, then, well,
whatever it is. If you know the density of one fluid, you can find the
density of the other.</p>

<p>Okay, yet another application of this law that the pressure is equal
at a given height is the famous hydraulic press. So, here is a--Here
are two pistons of different radii. This has got cross section area
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>; this has got cross section area
<i>A<sub>2</sub></i>. And here I want to put some incompressible fluid.
Incompressible fluid is something whose volume cannot be changed no
matter how much you press it. Now, water is pretty close to
incompressible. It does have a compressibility, but it's not going to
change very much for our purposes. So now here, I have a piston, and I
have a piston here. And I push down here with a force
<i>F<sub>1</sub></i>, and I ask, "What will I get at the other side?"
You might think <i>F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub></i>, but since these
fluids are at the same height, we only know <i>P<sub>1</sub> =
P<sub>2</sub></i>. That means <i>F<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>1</sub> =
F<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>2</sub></i>. So, this fluid here will push up here
with a force <i>F<sub>2</sub></i>, which is equal to
<i>F<sub>1</sub></i> times <i>A<sub>2</sub></i> over
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. Did I get it right? Ah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Pardon me.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Did I make a mistake here?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> But I want to amplify the force.
So, what do we really want to do? Well, it's a matter of who you want
to emphasize. So, what you want to emphasize here--Maybe if I drew a
picture I will know exactly what I'm trying to do. This picture is
fine. In practice, this is not what you do. You want to push down here
and raise something there. Because what you really imagine is some
elephant. There's an elephant standing here, and you want to lift the
elephant by applying a force here. So, let's still call your force
<i>F<sub>2</sub></i>, and the force on the other side is the force you
apply times <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>A<sub>2</sub></i>. So
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>/<i>A<sub>2</sub></i> could be a hundred. What that
means is, if you apply one Newton here, you'll get a hundred Newtons on
the other side. So, that's the way to max--to convert a small force
into a large force.</p>

<p>But this is the oldest trick in the book. An even older one invented
by cave people, is that if you have a support like this you can put a
weight here and, uh, let me see, that's right. So, a tiny weight here
can lift a big weight here because that <i>mg</i> times that distance
and this <i>mg</i> times this distance will be equal. But you must know
even from that example that you don't get something for nothing. In
other words, if you lift the elephant here by pushing down here, the
fact that the forces don't match is perfectly okay. But the work you do
here must be the work delivered to the other side. The Law of
Conservation of Energy. The work you do on this side is the force
multiplied by the distance. Now, force multiplied by distance I'm going
to write as the pressure times the cross section area, times distance.
But what is <i>A</i> times--<i>A<sub>2</sub></i> times
d<i>X<sub>2</sub></i>? <i>A</i><sub>2</sub> times
<i>dX<sub>2</sub></i>--if you push the liquid here--if you moved it a
distance <i>ΔX<sub>2</sub></i>, area times <i>ΔX<sub>2</sub></i> is the
volume of fluid you push down here. That's the volume that'll come up
on the other side. So, you're free to write that as
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>A<sub>1</sub> ΔX<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Okay, but <i>P<sub>2</sub>A<sub>1</sub></i>--I'm sorry, yes, now,
let's write <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> is the same as <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>.
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> times <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> is
<i>F<sub>1</sub></i>. So, it just says that the force times distance on
one side is the force times distance on the other side. That means the
work you actually do is not amplified by the process. You cannot get
more joules out of one side by any device. What you put in is what
you'll get out. But still it's useful, because in practice you may have
to move a whole meter here to lift the elephant by one centimeter. But
the point is, you can lift elephants this way. That's the important
thing. Okay, that's why it's worth doing. And this is how you--the
brake in your car works. You know, you pump the brake pedal. There's a
little cylinder there and there's a fluid there, and the fluid is
pushed by your feet. And you push it quite a bit, several centimeters.
At the other end, there's another cylinder whose piston is right next
to the drum that's rotating, and pushes on the drum. And it exerts an
enormous amount of force, but it moves a very tiny amount. The shoes
that grab your rotating drum move a very tiny amount, whereas, your
feet move a large amount. But that's the ratio of the force that's
transmitted. The fluid has the same pressure. The brake fluid has the
same pressure, but the force you apply with your feet is much, much
smaller than the force that the drum will exert on the rotating--that
the disc brakes will exert on the rotating drum. So, a lot of
hydraulics is based on this simple amplification of force.</p>

<p>Alright. Now, I move to the next topic in this field, which is the
Archimedes' principle. So, we all know the conditions under which this
was discovered. So, I will not go into that, other than to say that Mr.
Archimedes noticed that if you immerse something in a fluid it seems to
weigh less. What I mean by that is that if you attached it to some kind
of a spring balance, and you weighed it so that the <i>kx</i> of the
spring was the <i>mg</i> of the object, and if you did the same thing
now you will find it seems to weigh less. And the question was, "How
much less?" Archimedes' answer is very simple. The amount by which you
lose the weight, or the weight loss, equals the weight of liquid
displaced.</p>

<p>Now, how do you show that? Because we don't, right now, so many
years after Archimedes, we will not accept this on faith. We want to be
able to show this is the case. There are several ways to prove this.
One way, which I like, is to say if you, if the thing you are hanging
here, was itself a chunk of water shaped like that, you don't have to
do anything. Because that chunk of water can float at that height for
free. But now, if you took the chunk of water and put a stone here of
the same shape, the rest of the fluid doesn't know what you're doing.
It applies the same force that it would to its own colleagues. Namely,
if this is water, the rest of the water is in a configuration ready to
support that amount of water. So, if you took that water out and put
something in, the water will apply the same amount of force and the
rest of it is your problem. You apply the remaining force. So, the
water is ready to support its own kind of any volume. That's the
meaning of being in equilibrium. Any chunk of water is in equilibrium;
therefore, it's getting an upward force equal to the weight.</p>

<p>What we are saying is, if without disturbing the environment, you
take the water out and put something in its place, the rest of the guys
will apply the same force. Now, one formal way to prove that--you can
take various geometries, but I prefer a cylindrical geometry. So this
is, in this example, not a piece of water, but a new material you've
introduced inside the water. And we want to find the buoyancy force.
What is the net force of buoyancy? Well, it's the pressure at the
bottom times the area, minus pressure at the top times the area. We
have already seen the difference in the pressure is <i>ρgh A</i>, but
<i>h</i> is now this height. Well, <i>h</i> times <i>A</i> is the
volume of the water, <i>ρ</i> times that is the weight of the water,
the mass of the water. That times <i>g</i> is the weight of the liquid
displaced. You can prove this for a cylinder; you can prove this for
all oddball shapes, by thinking a little harder. But this is good
enough. So, basically the body weighs less in water because the lower
part of the body is being pushed up harder than the upper part of the
body is being pushed down, because the pressure increases with depth.
That's why you get this result from Archimedes.</p>

<p>Now, you have to be a little careful on writing the equation,
because if this was made of a material like iron, then the density of
iron is less than--is more than the density of water. So, the weight of
that chunk of iron will be more than the weight of the water displaced.
So, you will have to provide a net force, and you can support it with
the cable. But suppose this was not made of iron, but made of cork? If
it's cork, it won't want to be there. Right? Because then, the applied
force by the water is more than the weight it takes to support it. So,
the cork will then bob up to the surface. It will look like this. If
you want to keep it down, it's like a rubber ducky. You want to keep
the rubber ducky inside the water level, you've got to pull it down, or
you want to tie it to the--I think one of the problems I gave you--has
somebody tied this piece of whatever to the floor. Then it'll stay. But
things will bob up to the surface. And the question is, "How far up
will it go?" We know part of it's going to be inside and part of it's
going to be outside. And you can ask how much will be outside and how
much will be inside?</p>

<p>You can already guess the answer, but let's prove it. Let <i>f</i>
be the fraction immersed, fractional volume immersed. Then, we can say
the weight of the liquid displaced is equal to the fractional volume
times <i>ρ</i>, times <i>g</i>, times the total volume, is the <i>ρ</i>
of water. You understand? This is the weight of water equal to the full
volume; this is the fraction of water displaced. So, this is simply the
weight of this shaded region here. And that is going to be equal to the
weight of the thing that's floating; that is the <i>ρg</i> times full
volume. If you cancel the <i>g</i>, and you cancel the volume, you find
that the fraction that is immersed is the density of the material
divided by density of water. In other words, if this material is 90
percent the density of water, it will be immersed by 90 percent. That's
exactly what happens with ice. As you all know, ice has a smaller
density than water. One of the great mysteries. Normally, when you cool
something it condenses and reduces in volume and the density will go
up. But ice actually expands when you cool it. That's why the density
of ice is less than the density of water. That's why ice floats on
water. That's the reason icebergs look like this, because the big part
of the iceberg--;that's the very peculiar property of ice. That's why
you have those movies like the Titanic where you've got a huge ice
thing and it's floating. First of all, if the density of ice was more
than the density of water, these two actors would still be alive. Okay?
But what happens is it is floating, and not only that; what you see is
maybe a small fraction of the whole thing. That's why those big ships
went down. Okay, but it's all thanks to this accident of nature that,
here is one substance which, when cold, increases its--decreases in
density.</p>

<p>Alright. Now, Archimedes' principle has got hundreds of
applications. If you want to build a boat, here's how we build a boat.
Here is the steel boat. Now, you cannot come to me and say, "How do you
make a steel boat float in water?" Okay. It's not a solid steel boat.
Okay? If you are thinking about a solid steel boat, you should get in
another line of work. This is a thing made out of steel, but it's
completely hollow. So, what we claim is, this amount of water weighs
the same amount as that amount of--see, the shaded region. So, you can
easily calculate how deep this one should sink to balance its weight.
Right? That, I assume you know how to do that. Take this to be a
rectangular boat. The cross section is rectangular; it's gone down to a
depth <i>ρ</i>, and to a depth <i>h</i>. Therefore, the volume of water
displaced, is <i>h</i> times the area of the boat, cross sectional of
the area of the floor of the boat. That's the volume of water, that's
the mass of water, that's the weight of water. That's the weight of the
boat. If you tell me how many tons the boat weighs and you give me the
area of the base and <i>g</i>, and density of water, I'll tell you what
height it'll sink. Then, of course, you can load more and more cargo in
this, you know, if you have a top here, start putting more and more
cargo; this will go down until the boat looks like this. And that's as
far as you can push it. That's the kind of simple calculation you will
be asked. How much cargo can the boat take? Well, that's very simple.
The weight of the boat plus weight of the cargo is maximal in this
critical situation, when it's just about to go under. Therefore, the
total volume of water displaced, times the density, times <i>g</i>,
will be the weight of your boat plus cargo.</p>

<p>And these are all elementary applications, and they came from two
principles. One is the pressure increases with depth; the second is
that the weight of the liquid displaced is the weight of the--is the
reduction in weight. So, you can imagine three cases, one where the
density of the material is more than the density of water, in which
case it'll start going down and you will have to hold it up with a
cable, but you won't have to apply the same force as you would outside.
The second example is when the density of the object is less than the
density of water, in which case it will float, with a certain fraction
of it immersed, and a certain fraction of it outside. The fraction
immersed is simply the same fraction as what you get by dividing its
density by the density of water. Also, the density of water changes. In
the Dead Sea, because of the salt concentration, density is a lot
higher. So, it's a lot easier for people to float.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, for the last and final topic that's called Bernoulli's
Equation. This is the first time I'm going to consider fluids in
motion. So far, my fluids were at rest. And it's really very simple.
But notice one more time, all I ever invoked was Newton's Law of
Motion. You realize that? I just took this fluid and took that fluid,
balanced the forces, and said there should be no acceleration. If I can
convince you of the one thing, I have accomplished something. To
realize that all the mechanics we have done does not appeal to any
other law than <i>F = ma</i>. In all these problems of equilibrium,
<i>a</i> is zero, <i>F</i> is zero. Just from that fact, and clever
applications of <i>F = ma</i>. For example, it's very clever to think
of a piece of the water and demand that it be in equilibrium. That's
how we find how the pressure varies with depth. But there's no new
principle so far. In fact, there's going to be no new principles at all
this term. And relativity was different. The old space-time was
modified, but non-relativistic mechanics is all coming from Newton's
law, as is this problem.</p>

<p>So, we're going to display for the first time, fluid motion. We're
going to take the most general case of fluid motion, where there's
water in some pipe. This is the most famous picture in all the
textbooks. We have not thought of a better picture now. We're all
working on it, but this is all we can come up with after 300 years.
Water flowing in a pipe. This point is going to be called 1; this point
is going to be called 2. Everything here will have a subscript 1. That
means, measured from some ground, that's at a height
<i>h<sub>1</sub></i>, that's at a height <i>h<sub>2</sub></i>. The
velocity of the fluid here is some <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>, the velocity
of the fluid there is <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. And <i>ρ</i> is the density
of the fluid, and that's not variable. So, imagine now a steady flow of
some fluid through a pipe, whose area of cross section is changing, and
the overall altitude is also changing. You can have a huge, you know,
pipe in the basement where the whole supply to the house comes,
branches out into little pipes maybe; this could be the pipe in the
attic. Small cross section possibly at a bigger height, it doesn't
matter. But we're not considering pipes that break up into four or five
pipes. This is just a single pipe.</p>

<p>So, here is the first law that you have to satisfy. If the fluid is
incompressible, there's a certain law. And we are going to talk about
that law. That's called the "equation of continuity." It relates the
area here and the velocity here, to the area here and the velocity
here. And the relationship should not surprise you. The basic premise
is going to be you're shoving in water from the left, and the water
cannot pile up between here and here because it's incompressible. That
means in that volume, you can only pack in so much water. So, what
comes in has to go out. It follows that it's got to go out much faster
here because the area is smaller. And what's the relation? You can
almost guess it, but let's prove that. How much water do you think
comes in through this phase, if you wait one second? Can you visualize
in your mind that in one second a certain amount of fluid comes in,
maybe until that point, and the cross section of that fluid is
<i>A</i>, the distance it travels is <i>V</i>. So, the volume of the
fluid coming in from the left is really
<i>A<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i>. That's called the flow rate coming
in. And that's got to flow out, and that's the flow rate outside. So,
in an incompressible fluid, if I tell you the flow rate at one point,
I've told you the flow rate everywhere. Think of cars going down a
freeway, and the freeway's getting narrow, but unlike in real life, we
don't allow the cars to pile up. We want the density of cars to be the
same. That means if there's a narrow road, they've got to go faster to
maintain the traffic. That follows--Then, it follows, that if I go to
one checkpoint and see how many cars cross me per second here, the same
number will cross anywhere else. But the speeds will be in inverse
proportion to the area so that the product remains the same.</p>

<p>Now, let me show this to you in another way. It's going to be
helpful. Let me wait a small time <i>Δt</i>. In a small time <i>Δt</i>,
this front that was here would advance there. It'll go a distance
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> times the <i>Δt</i>. On the other end, this front
will advance the distance, <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>Δt</i>. Now,
the volume that got pushed in the time <i>Δt</i> is
<i>A<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>Δt</i>, and that's the volume that came
out on the other side. And you can cancel the <i>Δt</i>s and come up
with the result I gave you. So wait a short time, see what comes into
the left phase, and see what goes out of the right phase and equate
them.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, we are going to find a constraint between the state of
the fluid here and the state of the fluid there. What I'm going to
do--Look, think about what's going to happen before you derive any
formula. Suppose you're going uphill. Does it make sense to you that
when the fluid climbs uphill it's going to slow down? It will slow down
on the way to the top, because it's got to work against gravity. Even
if you threw a rock up there, it's going to go up and slow down.
Therefore, there's going to be some connection between the gain in
height and the velocity of the fluid. Just from the Law of Conservation
of Energy. That's all I'm going to do. Here is what I'm going to do.
You remember if there are no external forces on a system, kinetic plus
potential is kinetic plus potential. If there are external forces on a
system, kinetic plus potential after minus kinetic plus potential,
before, is the work done by external forces. That's what I'm going to
use here.</p>

<p>What are the external forces, and what's the energy is what I'm
going to think about. So, here's what I'm going to focus on. Take this
region of fluid trapped between these two cross sections at <i>t</i> =
0. Wait a short time <i>Δt</i>. What happens to the body of fluid? It
does what I told you. In the front, it advances to the new region
there. Maybe I should draw better pictures here. This is the advance of
the rear guard, and in the front, the fluid that used to terminate here
has gone up to there. In other words, if I colored this fluid, just
this part of the fluid between here and here, a different color from
the rest of the fluid, a short time later that colored liquid will be
occupying this new volume. It's the same numerical volume, but it's a
slightly different volume. I'm going to compare the energy of this
chunk of fluid before and after. You realize that in that comparison
this region in between the shaded regions is common to both the chunks
of fluid. Pointwise, the fluid in the same location is going at the
same velocity. So, I don't have to worry about that. That's common to
before and after. The only difference between final minus initial is
the energy contained in that region minus the energy contained in this
region. The rest of it, like here, it was part of the old fluid; it's
part of the new fluid, it's at the same height going at the same speed.
So, you don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>So, what's the volume? What's the energy of this region? The energy
is going to be <i>ρ</i> times <i>A<sub>2</sub></i> times
<i>Δx<sub>2</sub></i>. <i>Δx<sub>2</sub></i> is the distance it
advances here. That's the volume of the fluid; that's the mass of the
fluid. Sorry, that times <i>g</i> is the mass of the fluid. And the
kinetic energy will be mass times <i>V<sup>2</sup></i> over 2.
Potential energy will be--I'm sorry, am I doing something right? I
think I made a mistake. Sorry about that. There is no <i>g</i> here.
Let me do it more slowly. What's the mass of the shaded region? It's
got a base <i>A<sub>2</sub></i>; it's got a height
<i>Δx<sub>2</sub></i>. That's a volume, times density is the mass,
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i> over 2 is the kinetic energy. Potential energy
would be the same mass times <i>gh</i>, but I should call it
<i>gh<sub>2</sub></i>. Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, you're worried about the
height varying over the tube. Yeah, we are neglecting that aspect.
That's an important point. You can ask, when you say
<i>h<sub>2</sub></i> are you talking about the middle or the end and so
on. But we are going to be dealing with problems where the height
differences are much bigger than the cross section of the pipe. So, we
don't worry about that.</p>

<p>Okay. Now, what is the same quantity here? It's going to be minus
<i>ρA<sub>1</sub>ΔX<sub>1</sub></i>, times
<i>V<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over 2 plus <i>ρ</i> times
<i>gh<sub>1</sub></i>. That's the final energy minus initial energy.
That's got to be equal to the work done. Now, who is doing the work on
this? Can you guys understand? Where is the work coming from? Yep?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Ah. No. Gravity you don't count
as a force when you have a potential energy for gravity. Gravity is
included. The minute you write <i>ρgh</i> or <i>mgh</i>, you don't
count gravity again.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Right. But if I'm looking at the
fluid in question, who is acting on that fluid? Not what it's doing to
others. Who are the others doing something to this fluid? Yep.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Now, the walls of the pipe will
apply a normal force, and that will not do any work. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, but that person is
somewhere here. But remember, in mechanics you don't have to go to
people in remote places. I've told you, when you apply Newton's law,
the only kinds of forces are what? Remember from day one? Contact
forces. Except for gravity, which reaches out and grabs everything.
We've included gravity. Who is this body of fluid in contact with?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> This fluid? In between? No, but
I'm talking about this fluid. I'm talking about all of this fluid. My
taking the difference of that shaded region and that shaded region was
a convenience, but I'm looking at the energy change in all of this
fluid.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yeah, but the point is the fluid
to the left here is pushing it, and it is pushing the fluid to the
right. Okay? That's the only way. It is true there's a pump somewhere
pushing the fluid in the beginning, but you don't have to go all the
way to the pump. In the end you only ask, who is in contact with me?
Well, it's the guys to the left. So, they will exert a force
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>, times <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>, times
<i>Δx<sub>1</sub></i> because that's the force, that's the distance,
that's the work done on the fluid. And the work done by the fluid is
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>A<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>Δx<sub>2</sub></i>,
because if it moves to the right it is doing work on the left because
it has work done on it. There you go. Now you can see that
<i>A<sub>1</sub>Δx<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>A<sub>2</sub>Δx<sub>2</sub></i> are all equal because that is just
the volume of the fluid displaced in a short time. That is just the
continuity equation. If you divide everything by <i>Δt</i>, if you
like, then you will find that <i>Δx<sub>2</sub></i> over <i>Δt</i> is
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i>. I'm just using the fact
<i>A<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>A<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i>.
So, if you cancelled those factors, what do I get? I'm going to just
write it for you. Now, you guys can go home and check it.
<i>P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub></i> = ½ <i>ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>
+ ρgh<sub>2</sub></i>, minus ½ <i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> -
ρgh<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Now, this is a derivation that you can go home and study at leisure
in any book you like. They're all the same; the story is the same. I
can only tell you, if you like to know, what the trick behind the
derivation was. I don't mind going over that because maybe there are
different volumes in question and you may have gotten confused. But
first, let me write down the result. By writing everything with 1 on
the one side, and 2 on the other side I get this result:
<i>P<sub>1</sub> + ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> over 2 +
<i>ρgh<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> + ρgh<sub>2</sub></i> + ½
<i>ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. This is nothing other than the Law
of Conservation of Energy applied to unit volume. If you take one meter
cubed of the fluid, its mass is <i>ρ</i> times 1. So, this is really a
mass of one cubic meter of the fluid. This is its kinetic energy;
that's its potential energy. That's the kinetic and that's the
potential. You might say, "Why aren't we just equating kinetic plus
potential to kinetic plus potential?" It's because this chunk of fluid
that I focused on is not an isolated system. It's getting pushed from
people behind it, and it's pushing people ahead of it. So, you've got
to take the difference between the work done on it, and the work done
by it. Then, you will find they don't quite cancel because the
pressures are not equal. If the pressures are unequal, you get an extra
contribution. But this is simply the Law of Conservation of Energy. I
got it by writing the Law of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>But it takes a while for you guys to get used to applying the Law of
Conservation of Energy. Maybe you are always used to saying kinetic
plus potential is kinetic plus potential. You got used to that, or you
also remember kinetic plus potential may be less at the end than the
beginning, because there is friction. This is yet another thing. Where
there's no friction, but there are external forces acting on a body,
there is gravity, which is included the minute you write a potential
energy <i>mgh</i>. There's the walls, too. I think some of you brought
up a very good point. The walls are exerting a force, but that's
perpendicular to the fluid. In a real fluid, the walls will in fact
exert a force parallel to the fluid, and it's called viscosity. So, in
a real fluid there will be a drag on the fluid because the fluid really
doesn't like to move right up against the walls. It doesn't mind moving
in the middle of the tube. So, as you go near the edges, the speed of
the fluid will relax to zero. There's a region where there's a lot of
dissipation. So, we're ignoring what's called viscosity. We're ignoring
all other losses. Then, this is simply the Law of Conservation of
Energy.</p>

<p>And as to what I did with those two volumes, maybe I'll repeat this
so you can all follow this. I'm saying, take all that fluid now, find
the total energy in it, and ask what happened to that fluid a little
later. Well, fortunately, here the pipe also had some problems
[laughter]. Okay. Where is this fluid a short time later? I want you to
think about it. This end has moved here, this end has moved there. So,
the fluid at the end of the day is sitting there. I want the energy of
all of these guys minus the energy of all of this. Then, you can see in
the comparison, it's only this part that has gained, and this part that
has lost. This part is common. When I say common, not only is the mass
common--the location--at every location the height and velocity are the
same. So, in the subtraction this will cancel that. That'll cancel
that. This will have nothing to cancel and this will have nothing to
cancel. So, just focus on the relative increments, and that difference
is what gives you the net change in energy, and you equate that to the
work done.</p>

<p>Okay. So now, we are going to learn how to use this Bernoulli. The
main thing to notice about Bernoulli is, for a minute, if you focus on
fluid at the same height. Just think about the same height. He tells
you whenever the fluid picks up speed, it's going to lose pressure.
Because <i>P + V<sup>2</sup></i> or something, is <i>P +
V<sup>2</sup></i> afterwards. If you increase <i>V</i>, you're going to
decrease <i>P</i>. And that's the thrust of Bernoulli on a qualitative
level.</p>

<p>I'll give you some quantitative examples. So, one example is a
baseball. Here's as baseball coursing through air. If you like, you can
sit and ride with the baseball, and say the air going backwards and the
baseball is going that way. Now, suppose you spin the baseball like
this. If you spin the baseball, it carries some of its own air due to
friction between the leather and the air. So, that velocity is counter
to the velocity of the drift here on the top and additive on the
bottom. So, the actual air velocity on the bottom will be more on the
bottom and less on the top because you're subtracting this vector from
the top and adding this vector on the bottom. So, if the velocity is
different, this is the higher velocity region, this is the lower
velocity region. So, pressure here will be less than the pressure
there. So, the ball will sink down. If you spun it the opposite way,
the ball will rise up. If you spun the ball side to side, the ball will
curve from left to right. So, that's the spin on the ball. If I spin
the ball and release it, then it produces extra forces. This rising and
falling is on top of the falling due to gravity. Even in a planet
without gravity you will have this extra force. It's coming simply
because the velocity of the top and bottom have been modified.</p>

<p>Here's another example. Here's an airplane wing. The plane is going
like this. You'll go right with the plane, in which case the air seems
to be doing this. Far from the plane, everything looks the same as if
the wing were not there. But near the wing, this is the flow of air
past the wing. Notice that these guys above the wing have to travel
further than the particles below the wing so they can catch up here,
where everything is the same. So, the velocity on top of the airfoil is
faster; therefore, pressure is lower. Pressure is lower than on the
bottom, then the difference in pressure times the area of the wing will
push the wing up. That's the lift you get when you start a plane. When
you're on the runway, this is why the plane goes up. Once you're
airborne, you can tilt your wing. When you tilt your wing to this
angle, then of course it's very clear that you can get a component of
lift. But I'm talking about when the wing is not tilted but horizontal.
That's what gives you the lift. Now, what if you made a wing that looks
like this? Okay. So, you're all laughing. But this has a use too. Have
you seen it anywhere?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Yes? NASCAR. On the racetrack
you want the opposite effect, because you want to push down on the car,
and therefore you manufacture wings. You go to the factory where by
mistake they built a wing that looks like this, and you can bring it to
your race car and attach it, then it will keep the race car down. Of
course, you also have the other option of going to the wing and tipping
it over and applying it to the airplane. But if it did not occur to
you, if you thought once the wing is made like I'm stuck with this
wing, well, go take it to your race car, attach it. That'll push it
down. Because you want to get traction. So, you can get the upward lift
or the downward lift. Now, it turns out this lift theory is actually
somewhat naïve. And I believed it for a long time. Now, I know the
story is more complicated. There is a lot of truth to this, but it's
not the whole story. If you go into aeronautic engineering, you will
find out that it's a little more complicated. The reason, the way to
calculate it precisely--But this general notion that when the air moves
fast it loses pressure is true.</p>

<p>So, here's another example. If you have an atomizer, you know, you
have a perfume here and you've got a pump. And then, you have a tube
here. When you squeeze the pump, the instant you squeeze the pump,
you're driving a lot of air here at high velocity, whereas the air
here, is at rest. So, high velocity air has a lower pressure than low
velocity air. Therefore, it will suck the perfume and spray it right on
your face [laughter]. Yes. Okay. Very good. You know, I've taught you
so many things, planet and supernovae, and galaxies, but now I got a
rise out of this class. They said, now we are telling you something
useful [laughter].</p>

<p>Alright. So, now I'm going to do two problems where I really start
putting numbers in. This is very qualitative. I'm going to do
quantitative problems. And there are only two kinds. So, when we are
done, we are done.</p>

<p>Here is a tank of water. And I poke a hole in this somewhere here,
at a depth, let's call it <i>h</i>. The question is, "How fast will the
water come out of here?" Turns out you can use this Bernoulli's,
whether it is called Bernoulli's equation. You can use Bernoulli to
derive this. We just have to pick the points one and two cleverly. So,
this is going to be point 1; this is going to be point 2. Point 2, in
fact, is just outside that hole. So, what does Bernoulli say?
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i>, which is atmospheric pressure, plus ½
<i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ρgh<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub></i> + ½
<i>ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ρgh<sub>2</sub></i>. Let's modify this
as follows: let's pick <i>h<sub>2</sub></i> to be zero, then
<i>h<sub>1</sub></i> is just this. I mean, you can pick the zero any
way you like. So, where the hole is I'm calling zero. So, I don't have
to worry about this one. <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> is what I'm after. What
about <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>2</sub></i>?
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> is atmospheric pressure there, and right outside
the hole it's also the atmospheric pressure. So, <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>
and <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> you cancel because they're both equal to
atmospheric pressure. How about the velocity here? You know that if you
punch a hole in the tank and you drain it, it's going to start moving
down. But we're going to imagine that's a huge tank, ten meters
diameter, and this is a tiny pinprick. Then, this velocity is
negligible. You can put that back in if you like. I'm just going to
ignore that for now. That tells me <i>ρgh<sub>1</sub></i> = ½
<i>ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>; cancel the <i>ρ</i>, and you find
<i>V<sup>2</sup></i> = 2<i>gh</i>. <i>V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> =
2<i>gh</i>.</p>

<p>Now, you remember this formula from day one. This is the velocity a
droplet would have if it, say, spilled over the top and fell straight
down. Because that is just the <i>mgh</i> being converted to ½
<i>mv<sup>2</sup></i>. Because by the Law of Conversation of Energy,
the minute the fluid starts coming out of here and draining out of the
top, I have traded droplets of water at the top for droplets of water
at the bottom. Therefore, since they had potential energy at the top,
they most likely have kinetic energy at the bottom. But be clear about
one thing: the drop coming here is not the same drop moving at the top.
If I push it over the top, that would be the same drop, and that's very
clear to all of us. The beauty of this is this water is pushing down
and something's coming out here. It's coming out with the right speed
so that drop by drop, the kinetic energy of what comes out here, is the
potential energy of what's draining at the top. So, you can punch the
hole at various places. You know, once you punch a hole here it's going
to land there. And you can imagine the fun you can have with this kind
of problem. Where do I punch the hole so that if my dog is standing
here it's going to feed the dog? Or don't feed the dog, go up in front
of the dog, go past the dog. Get the biggest range, smallest range, a
whole bunch of problems. They will combine this Bernoulli who will tell
you how fast it's coming out with chapter one of how to do trajectories
once the fluid is coming out this way.</p>

<p>Okay. Last topic. It's again--it's not even a new topic. The last
application of Bernoulli has to do with the--what you call the Venturi
meter. By the way, you can imagine this is just a cross section of
possible applications of fluid dynamics. You can take a whole course on
fluid dynamics.</p>

<p>So, let's take the following problem. So, you're going in an
airplane, and you want to find out how fast the plane is going. How do
you think you find out? I will show you know one device people use to
find the flow rate, to find the speed of the plane through the
atmosphere. So, you go to the plane and you attach the following device
to the underside of the plane. Well, this, I'm imagining in my mind a
symmetric thing. This is a pipe with a constriction. Here the air is
coming in at the speed of the plane itself. See, in real life the plane
is going through the air, but go sit with the plane, because the air is
going backwards at the speed of the plane. So, that's a cross section
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i> here. <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> is what we are trying
to find. I hope you understand. That's our goal. Then it comes to this
region where it has to speed up, because
<i>A<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub></i> is <i>A<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></i>.
If it speeds up, the pressure of the air is going to be lower. Let's
first calculate the pressure difference between this point and this
point. Now they're both at the same altitude.</p>

<p>Here's another example. You're 5,000 feet above the ground; don't
worry about altitude to here or there or there. That's, 5,000 is the
big height, and that <i>ρgh</i> cancels on both sides. We don't worry
about the variation in height over this gadget. It's a very, very tiny
thing you attach to the underside of the plane. So then, I can say
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> + ½ <i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
ρgh<sub>1</sub></i>, I'm not going to write because
<i>h<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>h<sub>2</sub></i> are going be equal. Then,
it's <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> ½ <i>ρV<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.
Therefore, <i>P<sub>2</sub> - P<sub>1</sub></i> = ½
<i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. Now,
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i> is the speed of the plane. Now,
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i> is not the speed of the plane, but we know what
<i>V<sub>2</sub></i> is because <i>V<sub>2</sub></i> times
<i>A<sub>2</sub></i> is equal to <i>V<sub>1</sub></i> times
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. So, we can write here ½
<i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - V<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> =
V<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> times <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> over
<i>A<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>. So, pull out the
<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>, and you write it as ½
<i>ρV<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i> times one minus
<i>(A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2)</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.</p>

<p>So, let's digest this formula for a second. In this problem,
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i> is bigger than <i>A<sub>2</sub></i>. So, you may
worry that 1 - <i>A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i> is
negative, but so is <i>P<sub>2</sub> - P<sub>1</sub></i> because
<i>P<sub>2</sub></i> here is certainly going to be lower than
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> here. So, if you're happier, you can flip it
backwards and write <i>P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub></i> is something.
You see that? You can flip it over, provided you flip it over here. But
ask yourself, "What do I need to know to find the speed of the plane?"
The speed of the plane is here. The <i>ρ</i> is the density of what?
Can you tell me, <i>ρ</i> is density of what? Air; <i>ρ</i> is the
density of air. <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>A<sub>2</sub></i> are
known, because you designed the tube. So, if you can find the pressure
difference, somehow, you can read off the speed of the plane. So, what
people do to find the pressure difference is they go and they
take--they punch a hole there and they put here a fluid, like oil. If
the plane is not moving, you can tell these two heights must be equal
because that's a condition for the hydrostatic equilibrium. Because
these two pressures are equal. But if the plane starts moving and the
pressure here is lower than the pressure here.</p>

<p>Imagine this is a high pressure; that's low pressure. It'll push the
fluid up and it'll start looking like this, with a little extra on the
other side. And how much extra is it? Well, let's think about it. The
pressure at these two points is the same; the pressure here is what I
called <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>; the pressure here is <i>P<sub>2</sub> +
ρg</i> times the height of this fluid. This <i>ρ</i> is not the density
of air. This <i>ρ</i> is the density of, oil let's say. So, the minute
the plane begins to move, the pressure here will be higher than
pressure here; the fluid will be pushed up. And the difference in these
two heights directly is a measure of the pressure difference. That, in
turn, is a measure of the velocity. So, what you will try to do is
then, forget all about the height difference, and if you're clever
enough you can put marking so that by counting the difference in the
markings you can translate to the speed of the plane.</p>

<p>You can also use this to find the rate at which oil is flowing.
Suppose oil is flowing in a pipe and you want to know the rate at which
oil is flowing. Again, create a constriction in the flow, then put some
tubes. This cannot be oil; this has got to be some other fluid. Once
again, there'll be pressure difference and there'll be height
difference. And from the height difference you can find the rate at
which the fluid is flowing here. So, what's the trick we use? Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Oh, for this one?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Ramamurti Shankar:</b> Well, I don't--I think all
I'm--As far as I can tell, there's going to be a pressure difference
and that's going to translate into height difference. And if the two do
not mix, I don't know the danger. I think one danger you may have is if
the fluid comes in here, and if it can penetrate this, it will start
mixing. Right? So, for that purpose it may be better if this one is a
higher density than the one on top.</p>

<p>Now in practice, I am not really sure what kind of fluids people use
in any engineering thing. My--I get very shaky when you start going to
the real world. It's been my practice to avoid it as much as possible,
which is why I chose this career. But people who really want to build
something have to worry about what fluid to use, you know, what starts
mixing, what doesn't mix, what's the accuracy. So, I don't. If I
thought hard about it, I would try to reduce everything to Newton's
laws or some laws of thermodynamics. But it would take years and years
to go from there to something practical. So, I don't know in practice
what fluids people use. So, this is another example of Bernoulli's
principle.</p>

<p>Final one, which is the kind of a problem you sometimes do get. I'm
not going to write the equations or do the numbers, but I'll tell you
how to think about it. Suppose you have a tank of water. And I make
another tube here and I cap it. And the fluid here comes to some
height. First question you can ask is, "What's the height to which
fluid will rise here?" Now, you know from your high school days it will
rise to the same height, but what's the argument that you will give
today for why that height has to be the same? You will use Bernoulli's
principle, and you will take two points here, for example. Luckily,
there's no velocity to worry about. There is no height to worry about.
So, <i>P<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub></i>, which is what we did use by
other considerations. Those pressures are equal. If that is atmospheric
pressure, that's atmospheric pressure; then, these columns have to be
equal. They're starting with atmosphere plus <i>ρgh</i>; you want to
hit the same number here as there. But now, if you open this pipe and
let the fluid really start flowing, then the story is different. The
minute fluid stops flowing here--starts flowing--remember from the
Bernoulli, if you've got a velocity, you lose pressure. Pressure here
will be lower than the atmosphere, and then this will drop. It will
drop so that atmosphere, plus that height gives a pressure here, that
is atmosphere plus the bigger height gives the pressure here. And the
velocity here is assumed to be negligible, and the velocity here is
some velocity with which the fluid is coming out. Okay. So guys, have a
good holiday in spite of what I've done to you most reluctantly, and
I'll see you all after the break.</p>
