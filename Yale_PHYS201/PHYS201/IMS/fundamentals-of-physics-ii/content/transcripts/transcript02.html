<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Okay, normally I would ask in a small class if there is something you didn't
follow from last time. I'm afraid to do that now, because it's a big class and
I don't know how many things you follow or didn't follow. What I will do first
is write down a very quick summary of the main points from last time. So you
should ask yourself, &quot;Did I follow all those things?&quot; And if your
answer is yes, then you are fine. Because I talked about many, many things,
but you don't need all of that. So what I'm going to write down right now is
the absolute essentials of last lecture, okay? That's going to be needed for
what I do next. </p>
<p>First point was:
everything is made of atoms. You know that. And the atom has a nucleus. In
the nucleus are some things called protons, some things called neutrons, and
outside are some things called electrons. That's all the atomic structure we
need. Then we say certain entities have a property called electric charge.
The symbol for electric charge is <i>q,</i> and you can put a subscript to say
who you are talking about. So you can say <i>q</i> for the neutron is 0. A <i>q</i>
for the electron is -1.6 times 10 to the -19, and it's measured in coulombs.
The <i>q</i> for the proton is really--let me put it this way, <i>q</i> for the
proton is a positive number, so these minus signs cancel. Now, the importance
of the coulomb is that if anything has some coulombs on it, it will interact
with anything else that has some coulombs on it. So that if you have two
entities and this one has a charge of <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> coulombs, that one
has a charge of <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> coulombs, and the distance between them is
<i>r</i>, then the force is <i>q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i><sub> </sub>over 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i><i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. I'm purposely not
putting all the vector signs on <i>F</i> because it takes too long, but you all
know what the answer is. Namely, if you want the force on 2, due to 1, will be
repulsive if <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> are of the same sign
and point to the direction joining them. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Shouldn't it be 1
over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, thank you. There is another force law which is <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>, not
so famous, called Hooke's Law, but you're absolutely right. That's the
difference between being Newton and being Hooke. Hooke is known for the <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>law. Newton is known for the 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>law.
So this is a very important thing. If you see anything wrong you should stop
me, because when I go home, they're going to play the video for me to watch,
and I'm going to see that <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. There is nothing I can do
until some voice from the back says, &quot;Hey, send it downstairs&#8221;, and I
appreciate that a lot, okay? It's good, so never hesitate to do that, plus
sign, minus sign, symbols; anything that goes wrong. It also tells me that
you're following me. So for all those reasons you should not hesitate to
correct anything, and you should not think that you don't follow it because
it's your fault. Probably it is. Sometimes it's my fault as was demonstrated
now. Okay? </p>
<p>So this is the force
law. You need only one other ingredient. That's the superposition principle.
You need that ingredient because we're not going to be talking only about two
charges. We're going to be talking about many charges. And the question is:
what will they do when they're all present, and it's a great blessing that we
have the principle of superposition that says that if you've got, say, three
charges, say 1, 2 and 3, you want to know the force on 3 due to 2 and 1. You
can find the force that 1 would exert. You can find the force that 2 would
exert. We have two vectors, and you can add the two vectors to get the net
force. In other words, the interaction between pairs of charges is insensitive
to the presence of any other charges. They go about their business exactly the
same way. That is a principle that is not deduced by logic. You cannot say,
&quot;Of course, it had to be that way.&quot; That's not true. It doesn't
have to be that way. In fact it is not that way if you make supreme, I mean,
extremely exquisite measurements, but they occur really at the really quantum
level. For classical electromagnetic theory it is actually an experimental
fact that you can superpose. </p>
<p>All right, if you
combine those things you can calculate anything and everything that we will
deal with for sometime, but that's summary of--this is all I said last time,
okay? Now, I didn't do one thing, which is to emphasize to you that the force
of gravitation divided by the electric force is some number like 10 to the
-40. I put this twiddle here meaning not exactly. There are factors of 1 and
2 or 10 missing, but 10 to the -40 is roughly the magnitude of this ratio, and
it was done by comparing the force between electron and a proton. It didn't
matter what the distance was because everything goes like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
so when they take the ratio that cancels out, but this was really the ratio of
things like mass of the electron, mass of the proton, divided by 1 over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>; <i>q</i> of the
electron and <i>q</i> of the proton. If you put all these numbers in you've
got that. I want to mention one thing. It may be interesting for you to think
about. Look at this nucleus. Nucleus has a lot of protons in it, and
according to Coulomb's Law they all repel each other. And the neutrons, of
course, don't do anything because they have no electric charge. So you should
ask yourself, &quot;Why are all these protons staying together inside the
nucleus if I don't see any attraction between them?&quot; I see why the
electrons are hanging around, because they're attracted to the nucleus, because
nucleus is positively charged, electrons are negatively charged, and Mr.
Coulomb tells you they'll be attracted. What are the protons doing together in
that tiny space? That space is like 10 to the -13 centimeters. So have you
ever thought of that, or does anybody know why the protons are together? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The strong nuclear
force?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
There is a strong nuclear force. Okay, that's the answer. In other words, but
that answer will lead to more questions, but I'll first state the answer.
There's a force even stronger than the electric force. You see, this gives the
impression electric force is very strong. It is much stronger than gravity,
but there is a force even stronger than the electric force that is experienced
by protons and by neutrons. In other words there is another charge which is
not electric charge, which the protons are endowed with and the neutrons are
endowed with. And the force due to that charge, if you like, it's not called
charge but it's a similar thing, is much, much stronger. It had to be, because
you have to beat the electrical repulsion. So then you can ask yourself,
&quot;Well, in that case, how did we ever find the electrical force,&quot;
because here's another force even stronger than the electrical force, maybe a
thousand times stronger. Then why wasn't it completely overshadowing the
electrical force? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's irrelevant over
larger distances.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, so let me repeat what he said. It has to do with what's called the range
of the force. In other words, look at two different functions, okay? One
function looks like 1 over 137 times 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. Other
function looks like 10 times <i>e</i> to the -<i>r</i> over <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>
divided by <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>; <i>r<sub>0 </sub></i>is some length, and the
length is roughly 10 to the -13 centimeters, or 10 to -15 meters. Which force
are you more impressed with is the question, okay? If <i>r</i> is much bigger
than <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>, say 10 times bigger, you've got <i>e</i> to the -10
on the top. <i>e</i> to the -10 is a small number. <i>e</i> to the -3 is like
1 over 20. <i>e</i> to the -10 is 1 over 20 cubed. So then what will happen
is, this force, even though there's a number 10 in front of it, will be
negligible compared to this one. Whereas if <i>r</i> is much smaller than <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>,
say, <i>r</i> is .1 of <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>, so you can forget this number, <i>e</i>
to the minus point is roughly 1, then this 10 will dominate the 1 over 100. So
what happens is, if you're sitting inside the nucleus, the nuclear force is numerically
strong, not only because of the number in front of it, but also because this
exponential factor has not kicked in. Therefore, the protons feel an
attraction for each other due to the nuclear force that is stronger than the
repulsion due to the coulomb force. And the neutrons attract the protons just
as much as the protons attract the protons with respect to the nuclear force.
So neutrons are actually good, because when you throw an extra neutron into an
atom you don't add to the coulomb repulsion, but you add to the overall
attraction that they all feel for each other due to the nuclear force. So
neutrons are like the glue. As you add more and more protons, you will find
that you've got to add more and more neutrons to compensate the coulomb attraction.
</p>
<p>But a time will come
when the nucleus becomes so big, that even if you add enough neutrons, the
repulsion between protons from one end of the nucleus to the other is now
becoming comparable to the attraction due to the nuclear force, because nucleus
has become so big this factor is no longer negligible. See, over long
distances a coulomb force will always triumph, because no matter what the prefactors
are, the exponential factor in front of the nuclear force will always weaken
it. That's why you cannot have nuclei beyond some size. If you make them any
bigger, the nuclear electrical repulsion between the distant parts of the
protons, due to the distant protons in the nucleus, cannot be compensated by
the short-range attraction. So it's the range of the interaction that is a
significant factor here. So all the strong forces are strong, but at short
distances the coulomb force is not that strong, but it falls like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
Now gravity, on the other hand, is exactly 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>with
a number that's much, much, much smaller than this, but then we saw the other
day why gravity managed to survive, because this is <i>q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i>
and the <i>q</i>'s can be added algebraically and cancel each other. Whereas if
you've got <i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i><sub> </sub>over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>there is no way to cancel the <i>m</i>. </p>
<p>This is how the
different forces manage to survive for the different reasons, okay? Nuclear
wins in the nuclear zone, but dies very quickly outside the size of a nucleus.
Electrical forces falls more slowly at like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. They
dominate atomic physics, but once you formed an atom you've got pretty much an
electrical neutral thing, and once you've got many, many atoms making up our
planet, then all that remains is the gravitational attraction between a planet
and another planet. Okay, so these are examples of different forces and why
they were found at various times, because they all dominate under different
circumstances. </p>
<p>All right, so today
I'm going to start with my new stuff. So all you need to know, really, if you
want to do your problem sets and your homework, is Coulomb's Law, you know, how
to stick the numbers in the Coulomb's Law. And the only thing I didn't mention
is this 1 over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> is 9 times 10 to the 9<sup>th</sup>. So
today we're going to do something which is a part of a great abstraction and it
goes as follows: So I'm gong to take two charges, a <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> here
and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> here, and I'm going to give them some locations. So
let's say this guy is at vector <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, this one is at vector <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>.
Now, I will really take are of all the arrows. This one is <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>
- <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, that arrow there. You can check that I didn't mess up
anything, because <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
should be <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. So let's write the coulomb force now as a
vector. And you've got to say force on what, so I'm going to say force on 2,
due to 1. Now, you've got to realize it's a convention. So I use a
convention: This is the force on this guy and the force due to this guy, with
the second later. </p>
<p>Now, let's write it
out in detail. So that is <i>q</i><i><sub>1</sub></i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>. I'm going to put
the <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> here. Then here I want to write (<i>r<sub>1</sub></i>
- <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup>. That's the 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
but then I have to make it a vector. So for the vector part, once you have the
magnitude of the vector, you should multiply by vector of length unit 1 going
in the direction of this difference vector. So you can use any symbol you
like. One is to say <i>e<sub>12</sub></i>. <b>e</b>'s always going to be unit
vector going from 1 to 2, or if you're inclined you can also write <i>e<sub>12</sub></i><i>
</i>as <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> divided by the length of <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>
- <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>. They're all unit vectors. Now, do you follow that? I
mean, are you having trouble with unit vectors? Anytime I have a vector
pointing from here to there, I want to give a magnitude and direction. The
magnitude in this case is 1 over the distance squared, but you have to append
to it a vector of unit length in that direction. That's what makes it into a
vector. For example, suppose I want to describe that vector <i>r</i>, and it
is 7 meters long? I cannot write <i>r</i> = 7, because that doesn't tell you
which way it's pointing. So invent the vector called <i>i</i>, which is a unit
vector in the x direction and I multiply it by that. So 7<i>i</i> is a vector
parallel to <i>i</i> and 7 times long. 7.3<i>i</i> is a vector parallel to <i>i</i>
7.3 times long, okay? So you need to add a vector of unit length to the
magnitude, multiply it to get the actual vector. So that's that formula. </p>
<p>Then if you have many
charges, I'm not going to do that now, say one more here, it'll exert a force
on <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>, but you've got to add to the force due to 1. I'm not
going to do that. I'm just taking two guys. Now, I'm going to formally write
this as equal to the electric field at <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> times <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>,
and this is called a field. You see, if you look at this thing, all I've done
is rewrite the expression as something that involves a charge of <i>q­<sub>2</sub></i>
and everything else that involves the <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and the distance
from <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. So it looks like there's
no real content to giving this object a name, but it's a very profound notion,
so I've got to tell you the story that goes with it. In Coulomb's Law you say
that <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> exert a force on each other,
okay? And the force depends on the charge and the distance between them. Now
I'm going to say <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> produces an electric field at the
location of <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> given by this vector, and when I multiply by <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>
it gives me the force on <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. </p>
<p>Now, what's the
importance of the electric field? Whereas <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>
exist only at these two places, the electric field can be defined everywhere.
It doesn't require a second charge because you see, this number you can compute
for any value of <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>. So the picture we have is that <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>
produces an electric field all over space, and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> experiences
that field and gets repelled as a result, and the force it feels is the field
at that point times <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. In general, we say there's an
electric field at this point in space. If you put a charge <i>q</i> there it
should experience a force <i>q</i> times the electric field. So to understand
this, the charges are only in two places in our example, but the field due to <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>
is everywhere. At every point in space I can compute a field due to <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>.
So the field, you can see, will turn into a force if you multiply it by a
charge you put at the location of the field. So if you've got one charge here,
I claim there's a field here, there's field there; there's a field everywhere
due to this guy. How do I know, because if you put a test charge it begins to
feel a force. So one way to say it, is that the field is the force on a unit
charge you put at that location, unit charge because if <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> is
equal to 1 then numerically <i>E</i> is exactly equal to the force. If I go to
you and say, &quot;Find out the electric field at this point.&quot; You say,
&quot;Okay, where?&quot; I say, &quot;Here.&quot; What do you think you have
to do to measure the field? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Add up all the
forces on that field from the different charges, or add up all of the fields at
that point...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, okay. Her answer was, &quot;If I want the field here, I should find out
where all the charges are,&quot; right? &quot;Find all the forces they will
exert on this guy, on the unit charge here,&quot; right? But I'm telling you,
that's correct. That's the theoretical way to calculate the field at that
point, but suppose you're an experimentalist and you don't want to know what
produced it. You just want an answer to what's the field here. What will you
do? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Place a test charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, and then?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> And then see what
happens to it.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
By &#8216;see what happens&#39;, you've got to be more--so his answer was: put a test
charge, and see what happens. Now, you've got to be more precise. I think you
know what you meant, but I want you to finish that sentence.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Okay. Well, you can
measure the force by measuring the acceleration on the charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Very good. See, that's what I want. When you said, &quot;See what
happens,&quot; does it get married? Does it have children? That's not what I
meant, okay? But you did give the right answer. The answer was, by &#8216;see what
happens&#39;, you put the charge there, and you see what acceleration it
undergoes. Then that acceleration is the--that times the mass is the force
it's experiencing. That should be <i>q</i> that you place there times <i>E</i>.
If <i>q</i> was 1 that force itself is equal to <i>E</i>. If <i>q</i> was 10
you've got to divide the force by 10 to get the field there. So, the field is
like the sound of one hand clapping. People say one hand clapping is Zen
concept, but the field is like that, because you don't need two charges to have
a field. You just need one charge. </p>
<p>So here is how we
understand that. You put a charge <i>q</i>. If you go here something has
happened there, see? You don't need to put a second charge there to conclude
something has happened. Something really is different at this location because
the charge <i>q</i> is present. What is different? What is different is that when
this guy was not here and I put a charge, it just sat there. Whereas when this
guy is here and I put a charge, it experiences a force. So if you put a 1
coulomb here it experiences a force which is 1 times the field at that point,
therefore, this charge has distorted the space around it, in fact, everywhere.
Now, if you've got many, many, many charges, then they will all try to produce
a force on a unit charge and you should, like you said, add up the vectors,
which are the forces due to all the other charges on that one location, on a
test charge on that location. So the field is the sum of the field due to all
the charges at that point. Now, Coulomb's Law doesn't work when charges are
moving. Why is that? Have you any idea why you cannot use it? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The radius is
changing?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> <i>r</i> is
changing?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
<i>r</i> is changing so we'll keep changing it as the charge moves, but it's
only an approximation when charges move. Do you know why? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> There's a magnetic
field?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
True, but even the electric field--his answer was magnetic field, but even the
electric field is not properly given. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is the electric
field affected by something like the Doppler Effect?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Not the Doppler, something else. If Coulomb's Law were exact, okay? Here is
what I can do. You take a coulomb and you sit at the other end of the galaxy.
I have a coulomb here. You know the force my coulomb exerts on yours because
it's pushing against you. You hold it. Now suddenly I move my coulomb away
from you by a tiny amount. What will you feel? You will feel the force is
reduced. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Relativity is...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes, so the special theory does not allow that, because I have managed to communicate
with you, arbitrarily far, instantaneously. The minute I move this charge, you
know about it, because your charge moved away. For example, if your charge was
connected to a spring, and it had been extended to some amount because of this
charge, the minute I move it your spring will move. That instantaneous
communication is forbidden by the special theory, so it does not happen. So
the correct way to do it, it'll maybe come later in the course, so probably not
even at the end of this course, but the proper way to do that is to in the end
realize that the electric field at this point is not only due to what the
charges are doing now, but what they were doing in the past. Because if some
charge at the other end of the galaxy did something it takes some time, namely
traveling at the speed of light, to carry that information from there to here.
So it's the delayed response to all the motion in the charges that you've got
to add to find the field here. That's what makes the computation of the
electric field much more complicated. But if you promise me charges never move
then the location now is the location last year, the location a million years
ago, then you can use Coulomb's Law. Coulomb's Law is good for electrostatics,
but in real life charges are moving, so you cannot really use the formula.
Now, in our room, if you put a charge here and another charge there, if you
move this, that guy will move pretty much instantaneously. That's because the
time it takes a light signal to go from here to there is so small, you may
treat it as instantaneous. </p>
<p>So Coulomb's Law is
used in electrical circuits and so on. You don't worry about the time of
transit because it's too small, but over longer distances, where the time it
takes for light to travel becomes non-negligible, you cannot use Coulomb's
Law. It's not wrong. It is not appropriate when charges are moving. However,
it will always be true that if you go to any one point the force on any charge <i>q</i>
you put there is <i>q</i> times electric field at that point, okay? So the
electric field notion survives because it doesn't violate relativity. It says
if the field here is so much <i>q</i> will experience the force <i>q</i> times <i>E</i>,
but the complication is what is the field here? Well, it's due to everybody
else, and it's not only due to everybody else right now, but everybody else
from the dawn of time because things have been moving and shaking and sending
signals to us. We collect all that and see what lands here at this instant.
That decides the field here. So that's the computation of the field, but the
response to the field is very easy. You put a test charge; <i>q</i> times <i>E</i>
is the answer. So in modern physics, in theories that are compatible with the
special theory of relativity we break the force into two parts. Charges don't
immediately interact with other charges. Charges produce a field, and the
field may even propagate outwards at the speed of light if you make motions,
but another charge at the location of that particular point will respond to the
field at that point. So it's not responding to the charge right now. It's
responding to the field this charge produced at its location. </p>
<p>So all of
electromagnetic theory is going to contain two parts. The first part is, find
the field due to this charge configuration, that charge configuration, maybe
due to various currents, and the second part is, given the field, find the
response of charges to the field. So you understand charges play a double
role. They are the producers of the field. They are also the ones who respond
to the field. If you don't have a charge you cannot produce field. If you
don't have a charge you cannot experience it, you cannot play that game. To
gain membership into electrostatic interactions you've got to have charge. So
neutrons cannot do that, but they can do other things. Like I said, they take
part in nuclear force, in fact, just as well as protons do. </p>
<p>All right, so let's
go back now to the simplest problem in the world: the electric field due to one
charge. The formula is very simple. Let's put that charge at the origin. And
the electric field due to 1 charge is <i>q</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
if you're here, and that's your <i>r</i> vector. The field at this point is
that magnitude, and I'm going to write <i>e<sub>r</sub></i><sub> </sub>meaning
a vector of unit length in the radial direction. Once again, I will tell you
if you want, you can write that as the position vector divided by the length of
the position vector. They're equivalent ways. If I write it the second way,
you've got to be a little careful. It'll look like <i>qr</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i><i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. Don't get fooled
into thinking the field is falling at 1 over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. It's really
1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>because there's an <i>r</i> on the top.
See, if you write it as 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i> put unit vector. If you
write it as 1 over <i>r<sup>3 </sup></i>put the position vector. They're all
saying the same thing. </p>
<p>So here you have this
formula. If you're a person who likes to work with formulas this is all you
need. You manipulate the stuff on paper, and you add different fields, but
people like to visualize this. So how do I visualize this? That's the real
question. So here's a very popular method for visualizing this formula. You
know, you've got, for example--suppose someone asks you, what's the height
above ground level of a certain part of the United States? Okay, you've got
some mountains. You've got some valleys. Well, somebody can give you a
function that gives you the height at any point in the United States, but it's
more interesting to have some kind of a contour map that looks like this,
right? And all these contours are different heights. If you've gone hiking,
you can see those maps. They tell you pictorially what a certain function is
trying to tell you. So you want a pictorial representation of this electric
field. It's very easy to write down the electric field at one point, namely
you take that point, you draw an arrow there; <i>E</i>. That <i>E</i> is the
electric field at that point. So we try to do our best by saying here is my
test charge. I'm going to pick a few points, four points, maybe eight, and I'm
going to tell you what the field is at those points. At this point it looks
like that. At this point it looks like that. Here it looks like this. That's
already telling you something. You've got to be very careful on the
interpretation. This arrow is not telling you what's happening throughout the
length of the arrow. It's telling you what's happening at the tip. You
understand the arrow is in your mind. It's a vector. It's not really sticking
out in space. It's a property at a condition at that point, but we've got to
draw it, so we draw it that way. It doesn't tell you the state of affairs over
its length, but only at its tip, at the starting point. </p>
<p>Then you can say,
&quot;Okay, what happens when I go further out?&quot; When I go further out,
say over here, it's going to be still--if I put a test charge here it's still
going to be repelled radially, but a lot less. So I do that. So I draw arrows
at other representative points and make them shorter. In fact, the length of
the arrow will be 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. So you can do this, okay? But
now where all do you want to draw these arrows? It's up to you. You pick a
few points. You go to another radius, you draw more arrows. Someone had this
clever idea of doing the following. You can probably guess. Their idea was
when I join all these arrows like that, now if you go to a point like this,
what have I gained and what have I lost? What more information have I got when
I join the arrows? Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The more information
is that now you know the direction that it will continue on forever if no other
forces act on it, and what you've lost is the magnitude...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Okay, let me repeat that. That's what you guys should have been thinking in
your head. When I joined these lines--by the way, I do want you to anticipate
what I'm going to say, because if I'm struck by lightning, another
electromagnetic phenomenon, can you even complete my...</p>
<p><b>Student (Chorus):</b> Sentence!</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Sentence, right. Okay, now you should be able to go a little beyond if I'm
doing a derivation. You've got to be following me, right? That's very
important. It's got to be active. And I sat through a lecture yesterday for
an hour. I know it's a very long time. This is what, an hour and fifteen
minutes? The only way you can survive this is if you somehow make it an active
event. You've got to do something that keeps you awake during the process.
One of them is to anticipate what I will do next in a calculation. That&#39;ll
make sure also that you're on top of it, that&#39;ll make sure that you catch
mistakes. </p>
<p>Okay. All right, so
here are these lines. As she said quite correctly, previously I knew the field
direction only at the chosen points, but now I know it throughout this line,
but I've lost information on the magnitude of the field, because the arrows--there
are no lengths of anything. These arrows don't have any length. In fact, you
can keep drawing more lines if you like. They go like that in all directions.
It basically tells you, hey, the charge is pushing everything out radially no
matter where you are. That's the thrust of this picture. But, due to the
miraculous property of the coulomb force, namely that it falls like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>,
there is information even on the strength of the electric field, and that
information is contained in the density of electric field lines. And I'll tell
you precisely what I mean. So, here is the charge. Take a sphere of radius <i>r</i>
and here are all these lines going. By density of lines, I mean the number of
lines crossing a surface perpendicular to the lines, divided by the area of
that surface. Because let's make a convention that we will draw for every
coulomb a certain number of lines, 32 lines per coulomb, 32 lines are going
out. I draw a sphere of some radius, 32 lines cross that sphere. I draw a
bigger sphere, 32 lines cross this sphere also, but they're less dense, because
the number of lines per area will be some number of lines per charge divided by
the area of the sphere, which is 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i>. Do you follow that?
If you take a sphere, first of all, every portion of the sphere the area that
you have is perpendicular to the lines. So the area intercepts the lines
perpendicularly. That's the agreement here. And you see how many are crossing
per unit area. That is going like 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. So these lines
naturally diverge and spread out in space so that the density falls precisely
as 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>. </p>
<p>That has to do also
with the fact you're living in three dimensions. Only in three dimensions
where area goes like <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>does this spreading of the
density of lines coincide with the decline of the force. So these lines tell
you more than simply the direction. They convey to you visually where the
field is strong. Wherever the lines are dense, the field is strong. Wherever
the lines are spread apart, the field is weak, and it's a very precise
statement. The only thing not precise is, how many lines do you want to draw
per coulomb. That's really up to you, but you've got to be consistent. Once
you give 32 lines per coulomb, then if you've got a charge of 1 coulomb you
should draw 32. If you've got two coulombs, you should draw 64 lines. As long
as you do that, the number of lines crossing per unit area will be proportional
to the field. But I'm going to make a certain choice that will make the number
of lines per unit area exactly equal to the field, and here is the choice.
It's a choice that makes life simple. </p>
<p>Let us agree that 1
coulomb gets 1 over <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> lines. <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> is a number, right?
1 over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> is 9 times 10 to the
9<sup>th</sup>. This is some number. Maybe 40 million, so one coulomb gets 40
million lines. Don't quote the 40 million. It's whatever this thing is. I
don't know what it is. It's a definite number. Then, what's the nice thing?
If you've got <i>q</i> coulombs you will have <i>q</i> over <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> lines, and if you
take a sphere of radius <i>r</i> you'll get 1 over 4<i>&Pi;r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>as
the line density, namely lines per unit area, but that is exactly equal to the
strength of the electric field. If you picked a different number like 2 over <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> you will always be
measuring 2 times the electric field. The density will still convey the
electric field, namely it'll be proportional to it, but let's make life easy by
making it equal to it. This is just a convenience. Now, we are really set.
If you draw pictures this way, you can go as far as you like from this charge.
Simply take a unit area with you. Take a piece of wood 1 meter by 1 meter, put
it there, see how many lines cross; that is equal to the electric field at that
point. </p>
<p>Okay, so this is the
way one likes to visualize field lines. So I'm going to give you some
examples. For a single charge you just draw it that way. For two charges,
let's take two charges, a minus charge and a plus charge. Let's say that one
is -<i>q</i>, the other is +<i>q</i>. Then you are very near that charge. By
the way, I'm not going to draw 1 over <i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> lines per coulomb
because it's going to be too many lines, okay? I'm just going to draw a few so
you get the picture. So I'm going to draw four lines right near the charge.
You can forget about all other charges in drawing the lines. Why is that?
Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The field only
depends on the one charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Why does the field
only depends on the one charge.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Why does it depend on the one charge? In principle it depends on every
charge. Somebody had an answer back there? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Since it falls as 1
over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>when you're so much closer to one than the
other then...</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right, because the field is 1 over <i>r<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>and the 1
over <i>r</i> for this guy is going to infinity. 1 over <i>r</i> for this guy
is maybe 1 over 1 meter. It's finite. So when you come arbitrarily close to a
charge, it is going to dominate. Well, if it's the only thing in the universe,
we know the lines will look like this. At least they'll start out this way,
but soon, of course, it won't go out this way forever, because you will realize
there's another charge. Likewise, it's easy to draw the lines this way.
Remember, the lines are coming in because if you put a test charge, it'll be
sucked into this. Test charge is always assumed to be unit positive charge, so
the lines will be coming into a negative charge, and leaving, going away from a
positive charge. Now we've just go to do what the agencies forgot to do, which
is to connect the dots. You do this. You do this. You do this. You do
this. Now, at some point you'll have to think a little harder, because suppose
I go here? How do I know I should draw the lines this way? If I take this guy
here, it will repel it. This guy will attract it, and I add the two, and get a
line in that direction, so you really have to do a lot of work. If you really
want this picture to be exact, you have to compute the vector everywhere, but
if you want a sketch, you're allowed to guess, and things look like this. So
this is called a dipole, and this is the field of a dipole. </p>
<p>So here's another
example. Both guys are plus. Now what do the lines look like? Again, they
will start out this way near the charges, but now when you come to the midpoint
here there should be no electric field right in the midpoint because it's
getting pushed equally from both sides. So the lines, if you think about how
they will add, they will do something like this. Okay, look, I'm not going to
do a good job for a variety of reasons, but you can look at your textbook or
any other book to see what the lines will look like when you've two plus charges.
If you go a mile away from these two plus charges, what do you think the lines
would look like? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Just like a point
charge that's twice as strong.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right, so that's the intuition you should keep in your mind. If you go very
far from a charge distribution where you cannot look into the details, all you
will see is some little dot that has the entire charge in it, and the lines
will be coming out radially. So only when you zoom in you realize, hey, it's
not a single charge 2<i>q</i>, it is two guys of strength <i>q</i>. Finally,
let's take a case where this is charge 2<i>q</i>. This is charge <i>q</i>.
Let's say this is charge -<i>q</i>. Then some lines will go like this and some
lines will run off to infinity. Here if you go very, very far away from the
two charges you'll again see radially outgoing lines, except there is a charge <i>q</i>
at the center because 2<i>q</i> and -<i>q</i> give you a net of <i>q</i>.
Okay? So this is the example of a dipole. If you've got more charges it gets
more complicated, so people don't usually draw them. There's one example which
is pretty interesting. If you've got one plate and another plate, this
contains all positive charges, this contains all negative charges, then the
field here will look like this, will go from the positive to the negative
plate, because if you put a test charge between them, it's getting repelled by
the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate, so the lines will go
from one to the other. Near the edges they may do something more complicated,
but in the bulk they will look like this. </p>
<p>Okay, so now I'm
going to do one calculation, which is: what is the actual electric field due to
a dipole? In other words, not just the picture here, where is that? That
picture on the left is a dipole. I'm going to do it quantitatively. So here's
my goal: I want to take a minus charge here, a plus charge here. This is at <i>x</i>
= <i>a</i>. This is at <i>x</i> = -<i>a</i>. So I want to find the field
everywhere. So today I'm not going to do the field everywhere, because later
on I'll show you a more effective way to calculate it, but I'm going to
calculate it at a couple of interesting easy places. In other words, we all
know the lines look like this, okay? But I want to go to some location and
find the magnitude and direction of the field. But today I will only find it
at two places, one along the axis at a point <i>x</i>, and one on the
perpendicular bisector at a point (<i>x</i> = 0, <i>y</i>), just going to do
those two. So let's see what's the field here, the field at this point? The
field at that point, you agree, is going to be entirely in the x direction
because this is pushing it, and that is pulling it. So <i>E</i> is going to be
<i>i</i>(unit vector) times <i>q</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> times that distance
squared, which happens to be (<i>x - a</i>)<sup>2</sup>. That's the repulsion
due to the charge that's nearer to you. Then there's the attraction due to the
minus <i>q</i>, but it's a little further away, so it looks like a minus sign
but it is (<i>x + a</i>)<sup>2</sup>. If <i>a</i> is equal to 0 you get 0. If
<i>a</i> is equal to 0 the two guys are sitting exactly on top of each other.
You will not see them. So you see them only because they're not on top of each
other. This whole thing fails to be 0 because this <i>a</i> is not 0, and you
can understand why. The minute <i>a</i> is not 0 you're closer to one of the
two charges, so that they cannot really cancel each other. </p>
<p>So you've got to
manipulate this expression, so I will do that now. <i>q</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> and you find common
denominator. I remind you (<i>x</i> + <i>a</i>) times (<i>x</i> - <i>a</i>) is
(<i>x</i><sup>2 </sup>- <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup> </sup>and everything is
under squares. In the numerator you've got (<i>x</i> + <i>a</i>)<sup>2</sup> -
(<i>x</i> - <i>a</i>)<sup>2</sup>. So what does that give me? <i>i</i><i>q</i>
over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, (<i>x</i><sup>2 </sup>-
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>. And how about on the top, can you do that
in your head? This is going to be <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> +
2<i>xa</i>. You're going to subtract from it <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> + <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>
- 2<i>xa</i>, and the only thing that will survive will be 4<i>xa</i>. Is
everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Why is it not x - a
squared times x + a squared?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It is. You are saying why is it not (<i>x</i> + <i>a</i>)<sup>2</sup> times (<i>x</i>
- <i>a</i>)<sup>2</sup>, right? It is, because this would be <i>x</i> + <i>a</i>
times <i>x</i> - <i>a</i>, the whole thing squared.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
And this guy is <i>x</i><sup>2 </sup>- <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>. So this is
classified as a nice try, so. But I want you to keep doing this. This time I
am right, but you never know, okay? I don't want you to give up. There is nothing
better than shooting me down, but this happened to be correct. You satisfied
though?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I knew you were
right, I just couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, no, no, no. I don't want to rush through this. Anybody have the same
problem with this? Look, also I am doing it fast because this is 958th time
I'm doing this calculation, so if you're seeing it for the first time, I've got
to slow down. So let's see which part. Everybody okay with this, right? So I
wrote that. Then this is really an <i>x</i> + <i>a</i> times another <i>x</i>
+ <i>a</i>, and an <i>x</i> - <i>a</i> and another <i>x</i> - <i>a</i>, but
without these guys, I know it's <i>x</i><sup>2 </sup>- <i>a</i><sup>2 </sup>because
I've got two of everything. I squared everything. So this answer's actually
an exact formula of the electric field along the axis of the dipole. But
normally what one is interested in is, when <i>x</i> is much bigger than <i>a</i>.
When it's much bigger than <i>a,</i> downstairs you've got <i>x</i> squared.
This could be 1 kilometer squared, <i>a</i> squared was maybe 1 millimeter
squared. So in the first approximation, it's not an exact formula anymore,
from now on it is approximate, in the limit <i>x</i> is much bigger than <i>a</i>.
You can see it's going to be <i>i</i> times <i>q</i> over 2<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> times 2<i>a</i>
divided by <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>. So what did I do now? I took from the 4<i>a</i>.
I borrowed a 2<i>a</i> to write this here and I canceled the 2 with the 4 here
to get that. Then on the top I had an <i>x</i>, and the bottom had <i>x<sup>4</sup></i>.
I get <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>. So let me write--can everybody see this thing from
wherever you are; the last formula here? So I'm going to write it as <i>i</i> times
<i>p</i> divided by 2<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>.
So I will tell you what I'm doing. </p>
<p>So the final formula
I had was electric field <i>E</i> = <i>i</i>times <i>p</i> divided by 2<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i><i>x<sup>3</sup></i>, where <i>p</i>--I'm
sorry, <i>i</i>times <i>p</i>, no arrow; <i>p</i> is equal to 2<i>aq</i>. So
let's delete some extra arrows I had. That's right. You never should settle
for something that looks like that. So that's <i>p</i>. So <i>p</i> is called
the dipole moment of this dipole, and it's given by the product of the distance
between the charges and the value of one of the charges, the plus charge. So
whenever I give you two charges, call it dipole, you can associate with them a
vector. And the vector is, if you've got a charge -<i>q</i> here and a charge
+<i>q</i> there separated by a little vector <i>r,</i> then the dipole moment
is <i>q</i> times the little vector <i>r</i>. In our example the little vector
<i>r</i> was 2<i>a</i> in the x direction. So 2<i>a</i> times <i>i</i> times <i>q</i>
is the dipole moment. So this means electric field is parallel to the dipole
moment and falls like 1 over <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>. That's the most important
part of the dipole. A single charge, the field falls like 1 over <i>x<sup>2</sup>
</i>if you move a distance <i>x</i>. A dipole will always fall like a bigger
power of <i>x,</i> because to go like 1 over <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> you've got to
have net charge. As long as the net charge is 0 the fact that there are two
opposite charges that don't quite cancel each other, it always comes from the
fact that the distance between them is not 0. And the distance will appear in
the numerator, and that must be the corresponding distance in the denominator,
because the formula should have the same dimensions. That's what turns the 1
over <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> to 1 over <i>x<sup>3</sup></i>. Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> That only works if <i>x</i>
is a lot bigger than <i>a</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. So this formula is good for all <i>x</i>; this formula is good only for <i>x</i>
bigger than <i>a</i>. You'll find whenever you're working with dipoles, people
will always ask you to find the field very far from the dipole. So here's a
second place where I can go and find the field. That's going to be here, -<i>a</i>,
+<i>a</i>, and I'm going to find the field there. So that's at a distance <i>y</i>.
So let's look at this. That's a +<i>q</i> here and -<i>q</i> here. A +<i>q</i>
will repel it that way, and a -<i>q</i> will attract it this way, and their sum
will be that. I'm going to compute that sum. So how do I do this? Let's look
at this guy here. We know that these arrows have equal magnitude because this
distance is the same as that distance. Therefore, it's the horizontal part
that will remain. The vertical part will cancel. You see that? We've got two
arrows of the same length with this angle and this angle equal. The horizontal
part will be additive and the vertical part will be equal and opposite. So I'm
only going to compute the horizontal part. So the electric field now will be -<i>i</i>
(that's to tell me it's in the negative x direction) times <i>q</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> times 1 over
distance squared which is (<i>y<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>).
This is (<i>y<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>). </p>
<p>That's also (<i>y<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>), but I want the horizontal part of this, so I
want the cosine <i>&#952;</i>. That is the same
as this one. The cosine <i>&#952;</i> is <i>a</i> divided by (<i>y<sup>2</sup></i><sup> </sup>+
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>&frac12;</sup>. See, you want to take that force and find
this horizontal part. Then I'm going to put on another 2 because this is going
to contribute an equal horizontal part. So the <i>E</i>, in the end, is equal
to -<i>i</i><i>q</i>2<i>a</i> over 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> divided by (<i>y<sup>2</sup></i><sup>
</sup>+ <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>)<sup>3/2</sup>. That is then -<i>p</i> divided by
4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> divided by <i>y<sup>3</sup></i>,
for <i>y</i> much bigger than <i>a</i>. I'm sorry, <i>y<sup>3</sup></i>, <i>y</i>
is really the distance. So, right, if <i>y</i> is 1 mile and <i>a</i> is 1
millimeter that's essentially the distance. If you like you can call it -<i>p</i>
divided by 4<i>&Pi;</i><i>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i><i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. Where <i>r</i> is
the distance, if you like, from the center of dipole. Look, the point of this
exercise is twofold. One is to show you how to add vectorially the fields due
to two guys. Another is, to have you understand, at least, how to do the
computation at a few simple places, where the direction of the field is not so
hard to calculate. Actually, one would like to compute it here, but it becomes
quite nasty. The magnitude is not so hard, but the direction is hard to
calculate, so we'll find a shortcut. But at these two places, on the perpendicular
bisector and on the axis, the mathematics is pretty simple. That's the
electric field. Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is <i>p</i> as a
vector different from the <i>p</i> that you crossed out as a vector over there?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. It's the same <i>p</i>. So <i>p</i> as a vector in our example will be
the charge at either end times the distance between them. The vector
difference is 2<i>a</i> times <i>i</i>. So you can write the formula in terms
of the dipole moment. Okay, so now I'm going to do the second part of the
problem, which is finding the response to <i>E</i>. This was all computing <i>E</i>.
Of course there are more and more complicated examples, but we did a few simple
ones. Next is going to be, if I give you <i>E,</i> can you find what will
happen to the charge. So I'm going to do two examples. One is there are these
two plates I mentioned to you. This one is all positively charged. This one
is negatively charged. And I shoot a particle here, with some velocity <i>v</i>­<sub>o</sub>
in the x direction, and the field everywhere is down, and the electric field is
some constant, -<i>j</i> times some number <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. -<i>j</i>
because <i>i</i> is this way and <i>j</i> is that way. So what will this do is
the question, and where will it end up? Well, I think you can all tell that
it'll end up somewhere there. What we're trying to find out is how much does
it fall, and when it comes out, what's the direction of this final velocity
vector.</p>
<p>Well, the force on
this charge is equal to -<i>q</i> times <i>E<sub>0</sub> </i><i>j</i>. The
acceleration will be -<i>qE<sub>0</sub> </i>over <i>m</i> times <i>j</i> in the
y direction. So what'll be the position? Position will be from lecture number
one of your Physics 200. So let's say the starting point <i>r<sub>0 </sub></i>is
our origin. <i>v<sub>0</sub></i> is whatever it was projected in with, plus
&frac12; times <i>qE<sub>0</sub></i> over <i>m</i>, <i>t<sup>2</sup></i> <i>j</i>.
Okay, so as a function of time this tells you where the position will be. At <i>t</i>
= 0, you are at the origin. As <i>t</i> increases, it's moving horizontally
due to <i>v<sub>0 </sub></i>and it's also dropping vertically due to the
acceleration. Then it's very easy from now on to compute anything you like.
For example, when you want to go to that point, what will be the time? Anybody
tell me what the time will be when I go to that point? How long will it be in
the region between the plates? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The distance of the
length of the plate divided by initial velocity.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Which velocity should we take?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The initial
horizontal velocity.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct because <i>t</i> will be <i>L</i> over <i>v<sub>0</sub> </i>where
<i>v<sub>0­</sub></i>&#39;s<i> </i>the magnitude of the initial velocity because x
velocity is never changing. Acceleration is in the y direction. So the time
it takes to cross will be independent of the fact it's falling in the y
direction. So if you put <i>t</i> equal to all of this you will find out where
it will end up. And that's how you make pictures on the television. You've
got a bunch of plates, and then you drive charges, and if you apply the right
electric field the electron will land on a screen and make a little dot. The
screen will look like this, and you're looking at it from the other side.
It'll glow. Then you want the dot to move up and down, you can move the
voltage. Then if you want to move it back and forth you've got to put another
set of plates, not like this, but coming out of the blackboard. That way you
can move the electron beam in all directions. That's how you scan the
television screen. You can also use magnetic fields, but this is one simple
way using electric field. </p>
<p>All right, final
thing to discuss is: what is the force of a uniform electric field on a
dipole? So let's take an electric field in the x direction like that. It's
got a magnitude <i>E<sub>0</sub></i> and it's in the x direction. And in this
electric field I stick a dipole in like that. Here is the +<i>q</i>. Here is
the -<i>q</i>. Let's make that <i>a</i>. Let's make that <i>a</i>. So the
plus charge will experience a force like that. The minus charge will
experience a force like that. This will be <i>q</i> times <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>.
That'll be -<i>q</i> times <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. So dipole as a whole will not
feel any net force, because the two parts are getting pulled by opposite
amount. If the electric field were not uniform, namely if it were stronger
here than here, then of course it will drift to the right, but I'm taking
uniform electric field, and because the charges are equal and opposite, the net
force on it is 0. But something is not 0. You know what something is that's
not 0? Yep?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The torque.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The torque. There is a torque because there is a force here and the force
there. You can imagine they're trying to straighten out the dipole so it ends
up looking like this. So let's find the magnitude of that torque. Magnitude
of the torque is the force times the perpendicular distance. So if this angle
is <i>&#952;</i> here, and you want
the perpendicular distance, it is <i>a</i>sin<i>&#952;</i>. Then there's another <i>a</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> from that one.
That's the torque. But since 2<i>q</i> <i>a</i> is <i>p,</i> it's <i>pE<sub>0</sub></i>sin<i>&#952;</i>. You can see this
makes sense. If <i>&#952;</i> was 0, if the dipole
was aligned with the field, the torque vanishes, because if the charges are
like this there is no tendency to rotate. The biggest torque you get, if the
charges are like this, then this gets rotated that way. That gets rotated that
way. You get the maximum torque. Put <i>&#952;</i> equal to <i>&Pi; </i>by 2, you get a torque of <i>p</i>
times <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. That's also the reason it's called a dipole
moment. </p>
<p>Now, I'm going to
write this as a cross product, and I'm assuming you guys are familiar with the
cross product, right? You take two vectors, <i>p</i> and <i>E</i>, the cross
product has a magnitude, which is <i>p</i> times <i>E</i> times sine of the
angle between them, and a direction obtained by turning a screwdriver from <i>p</i>
to <i>E</i>. So <i>p</i> is like this. <i>E</i> is like this. Turn a
screwdriver from <i>p</i> to <i>E</i>, it goes into the board, and that's the
torque, and the dipole will then rotate until it lines up, or if you don't want
it to rotate you've got to provide a counter-torque of this magnitude. Now, if
you take any dipole and leave it, you know it will like to become horizontal,
so there is a certain restoring torque that tries to rotate it so it becomes
horizontal, and it's not very different from a spring, where if you pull it
from equilibrium, there is a restoring force that brings you back to where you
were. So this dipole is happiest when it's horizontal. If you go away from
horizontal the torque brings it back. So just like for a spring, if you've got
a force which is -<i>kx</i> we can assign a potential energy <i>U</i>, which is
&frac12; <i>kx<sup>2</sup></i> so that the force is equal to -d<i>U/</i>d<i>x</i>.
This is something I am assuming you guys know; the relation between potential
and force. Relation between potential and force, the potential at <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>
minus the potential at <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> is the integral of the force from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>
to <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. This is how potential is defined. This is the reason
why, if you knew the potential minus the derivative gives the force, and if you
knew the force, its integral will give you the change in potential. </p>
<p>All right, so now
when you do rotations, whatever you had for force you had for torque, and
whatever played the role of <i>x</i> is played by <i>&#952;</i>. In other words, in
rotational dynamics torque is to force--just like one of the SAT questions.
Torque is to force as <i>&#952;</i> is to <i>x</i>, and
work is just work. If you want to calculate the work done by the dipole, but
if you like the potential energy when it's at an angle <i>&#952;</i> and its potential
energy when it's at angle 0 is the integral of the torque d<i>&#952;</i> from 0 to <i>&#952;</i>. Now, what is the
torque? The torque is -<i>pE</i>sin<i>&#952;</i> <i>d</i><i>&#952;</i> from 0 to <i>&#952;</i>. There's a minus
sign because if <i>&#952;</i> tries to increase,
the torque tries to decrease it. That's why it has got a minus sign. Now,
integral of minus sin<i>&#952;</i> is cos<i>&#952;</i>, so you will get <i>pE</i>cos<i>&#952;</i> - <i>pE</i>cos 0 which
is -<i>pE</i>, and that is supposed to equal to <i>U</i>(<i>&#952;</i>) - <i>U</i>(<i>0</i>). By comparing the
two expressions you can identify <i>U</i>(<i>&#952;</i>) to be--sorry, this is <i>U</i>(<i>0</i>) minus <i>U</i>(<i>&#952;</i>), therefore <i>U</i>(<i>&#952;</i>) is equal to -<i>pE</i>cos<i>&#952;</i>, or just -<i>p</i>
dot <i>E</i>. </p>
<p>So that's the final
formula you have to remember, that the--can we bring it down here? When you
have a dipole in an electric field, it has a potential energy associated with
the angle which is -<i>p</i> dot <i>E</i>, and if you draw a picture of that as
a function of <i>&#952;</i> it goes like this. <i>&#952;</i> = 0 is when the
dipole is parallel to the field. That's when it has the minimum energy, -<i>pE</i>.
At 90 degrees, energy is 0. At 180 degrees, it's maximum. And the torque is
just -d<i>U</i>/d<i>&#952;</i> and you can see that
the torque here and there are zero, but this is the point of stable equilibrium.
That's the point of unstable equilibrium. See, if this was a potential energy
like a shape of the ground, if you left a marble there it'll stay there, but if
it moved a little bit, it would roll down hill. But if you left the marble
here it'll stay there, but if you move it, it'll rattle back and forth. That's
a stable equilibrium. That's unstable. So for the dipole when it's parallel
to the field you are here, and at anti-parallel to the field you are there.
The difference is when you're parallel and you move it a little bit, it'll have
stable oscillations, whereas if at anti-parallel if you move it a little bit
it'll flip over completely and come down here. </p>
<p>All right, so I'm
going to summarize the main points so you can carry that with you, okay? We
saw today that we should think in terms of electric field from now on, and we
no longer talk about direct interaction between charges. We say charges
produce fields, and fields act on charges to move them. The force of a field
on a charge is just <i>q</i> times <i>E</i>. The field is found by adding the
field due to all the charges in the universe, provided they're all at rest, and
you just add by Coulomb's Law. So we found the field due to a dipole allowing
the axis and perpendicular to the axis. We saw the notion of field lines as a
good way to visualize what's going on in the vicinity of the charges. The
lines tell you the direction where the field is, and they tell you in your line
density, lines cutting a unit area perpendicular to them, the strength of the
field. Then I calculated for you the field of a dipole along the axis and
perpendicular to the axis. There are a lot of formulas, but one thing you
should carry in your head. When you've got two equal and opposite charges and
you go very far, the field will go like 1 over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. The 1
over <i>r<sup>2</sup> </i>part of them is canceled, okay? That's the main
point, and it goes like 1 over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i> times 2 in one place, and 1
over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i> times 1 in one place. It doesn't matter. The main
thing is it's 1 over <i>r<sup>3</sup></i>. </p>
<p>Finally, if you take
a dipole and you put it in an electric field, it tends to line up because
there's a torque, <i>p</i> cross <i>E</i>, trying to line it up. With that
torque you can associate a potential energy by the usual formula that the
torque is minus a derivative of the potential energy. That potential energy is
-<i>p</i> dot <i>E</i>. Some of these things may come in handy later on. So
you don't have to memorize them, but they'll be involved later on. So I'm
going to post the problem set today. You can bring them into class next week.
There's one change. I wanted you to give it before class. I realize that's
going to be too disruptive, so you can give it after class. The reason I
wanted it before class is that I don't want you doing your homework in class.
I don't know how many generations have perished trying to follow that
strategy. It's just not worth missing a lecture to get one more problem right,
so don't bother. Once you come to class follow the lecture and don't do the
problems.</p>
