<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Let's start. I told you about Ampere's law, which is key to what we are going
to do next, so I'll remind you what the deal is. It says, if you have a closed
loop and around that loop you integrate the magnetic field that is equal to &#956;<sub>0</sub> times all the currents that penetrate this loop. So some current would be
going in, some current would be coming out. The guys who are outside the loop
don't contribute. Guys who are trapped inside this, they make a contribution.
That's Ampere's law.</p>
<p>Now you have to know
the convention. The convention is that you do the line integral
counterclockwise, and if your fingers are following the line integral, your
thumb points towards outside the board, and that current is positive. Anything
going into the board therefore will be counted as negative in this one. So
this has to be counted with sign, do you understand? If the contour goes one
way, all currents coming out of the board are positive, all those going in are
negative. In particular, if these 4 currents add up algebraically to 0, one is
2 amp, another is -2 amp and so on, then this integral will vanish, even though
there are currents. So it counts not the absolute value but the algebraic sum
of all the currents. Now there's another subtlety I didn't get into last time,
which is the following: remember, this is the current penetrating a surface,
bounded by this loop. You guys with me on what that means? </p>
<p>Now as long as I
force you to put this loop and to live in the plane of the blackboard, there's
only one surface with that loop as the boundary. But in real life, we are
doing stuff in three dimensions. Imagine pulling this loop out of the
blackboard. A lot of currents are coming and going out. What is the surface of
which this loop is the boundary? The answer is not unique. There are many,
many surfaces that have the same loop as the boundary, right? Take a piece of
wire and wrap it in the form of this boundary and dip it in soap, and you pull
it out, you'll get a soap filament. That soap filament has as its rim, or the
boundary, this loop. That may not even be planar. And if you blow on it, it's
going to bulge outside, right? Still this rim will be the boundary of that
bulging surface. So actually, even if the surface is coming out of the
blackboard, the theorem is still valid. </p>
<p>So let me draw
another picture that may be helpful. Suppose this is the surface and you've
got all these currents, some going in and some coming out. You may have
imagined all this time I meant a flat planar surface. I don&#39;t. You can
imagine now a curvy surface, like maybe a hemisphere, of which this rim is
still the boundary. You can ask, &quot;How can that be? Where do you want me
to count the currents, here or on that surface?&quot; The answer is, it doesn't
matter. It doesn't matter because any current coming in here has to get out
also through the other one. The only--or it may come in and decide to come back
here, in which case it doesn't leave the other one, but it will make 0
contribution to this contour because it's coming in once and going out once.
Because currents don't terminate, just like magnetic field lines, whatever
crosses this surface will also cross any surface with the same boundary. </p>
<p>That's a fact that
will become important later on. So you follow that? The law, if you want to
write it formally, I'm going to write it as some surface, and this is the
surface integral of the current density, which is the current per unit area.
And this loop is the boundary of that surface, and I told you that the boundary
of any surface is written as partial <i>S</i>. This is the correct way to
write Ampere's law. And the point I'm making is, this could be any surface
with that as the boundary. Now once you've got Ampere's law, I was trying to
show you how you can use it to solve certain problems that might have otherwise
been difficult. Just like Gauss's law. Remember, Gauss's law was very helpful
when you took a solid ball of charge. The electric field of that is usually
hard to find, but from spherical symmetry, you know the field is radially
outwards. You draw a Gaussian surface and you know the field's magnitude is
constant on a sphere. How big is it? You get that from Gauss's law. So certain
problems which are highly symmetric, you can get using Ampere's law also. </p>
<p>So one example I did,
I want to repeat it, because one thing I said wasn't right. There's this
current going from - to + infinity, and we want to find the field around it.
If you do an honest calculation, you will say, let me take a segment, let me
take a point, let me join the segment to that point and take the cross product
of the <i>dl</i> with the <i>R</i>, etc. and so on, right? And it will give
you a contribution coming out of the blackboard, but then you have to integrate
it. Now you don't have to do all that if you use symmetry. The symmetry
argument would tell you first of all that any field configuration you have will
be the same if you rotate it around a circle. Because if you look at the wire
end on and you turn the wire, it looks the same so the field configuration
should look the same. And I said there are only a couple of things that have
the property. </p>
<p>Here's a good one.
Maybe it does that. And the other one is this. Here is the wire. Notice if
you turn the wire, the wire looks the same, configuration looks the same. If
you turn this wire around its own axis, wire looks the same and the
configuration looks the same. Then I said we rule this guy out, because
magnetic field lines cannot come and end at a point. Then I gave another explanation,
which is that if you reverse the current, the field lines are supposed to go
outwards, but instead of reversing the current, if I grab it and turn it by 180
degrees around this axis, then the lines will still go in but the current would
be reversed. So for whatever reason, this is out and this is in. Then as to
the direction of the field, we also know that it has to be perpendicular to the
blackboard, because the two vectors whose cross product determines it lie in
the plane of the blackboard, so the field has to come out. It has to come out
and the amount by which it comes out cannot change as you go around the loop.
And the answer can only depend on how far you are from the wire. </p>
<p>Then I write Ampere's
law as 2<i>&Pi;R</i> times <i>B</i> at the radius <i>r</i> = &#956;<sub>0</sub> times
the current. In other words, I look at the wire from the end, and I take any
contour I like of radius <i>r</i>. Then since <i>B </i>is tangential to the
circle, the line integral is simply 2<i>&Pi;r</i> times <i>B</i>, and that's the
current enclosed, so you find <i>B</i>. If you like, <i>B<sub>&#934;</sub></i>, meaning in the
azimuthal direction. This angle is called phi. <i>B<sub>&#934;</sub></i> = &#956;<sub>0</sub><i>I</i>/2<i>&Pi;r</i>.
That's the result we got from integration, but you can also get it from
Ampere's law. Then I did another variation. I definitely don't want to repeat
that, which is, what if the wire is thick. Not a point wire but got finite
thickness with current coming out of the blackboard. What is going to be the
magnetic field? Then the answer depends on whether you pick a contour like
this or a contour inside the wire. And if you do the two things, you'll find
the field actually grows linearly inside, then falls like 1 over <i>r</i>
outside. Anyway, this is stuff I did near the end. </p>
<p>But now I want to
consider two new problems which I didn't study last time. The first one is
going to be very important, is the solenoid. If you imagine on a tube you wrap
some wire, and the wire is wrapped like this many, many times. And you want to
find the magnetic field. Now one loop we know produces a field that goes like
this. You stack them up, you expect the field to go like that inside the coil,
then sort of loop around and come back outside the coil. What we want to find
out is the strength of the field inside the coil, and also outside. </p>
<p>So the way you handle
this problem, you've got to take an Amperian loop that looks like this. If
this is the cardboard on which you wound that thing, see what this wire looks
like when you slice it vertically. That's the tube on which you wrapped it. I
want you to slice it vertically. On the left hand side, I've current coming in.
On the right hand side--coming out of the board and right, it's going on, you
guys see that? Wrap it around the solenoid and slice it down the middle, then
on this end, the current's coming out, on this end, the current's going in. So
I'm showing you the cross section of the tube. It looks like this. </p>
<p>So first thing I want
to argue is that the field outside does not vary with distance, because if I
took a loop like this--it's not a real loop; it's a mathematical loop on which
I'm going to use Ampere's law. I know the field outside is going to be coming
down, but maybe it's weaker here and stronger here and that's what I'm going to
rule out. You know how we can rule that out? </p>
<p>What would go wrong
if the field was weaker here than here? Something to do with Ampere's law.
Well, let me explain. Suppose you go around this loop. Here <i>B</i>and <i>dl</i>
are perpendicular, so there's no contribution to <i>B</i>&#8901;<i>dl</i>. Likewise here.
Here you have a <i>B</i> going one way and you have the same <i>B</i> but the
path is going the opposite way. Now these two have to cancel. These two have
to cancel because there is no current coming out of this. Because there's no
current coming out, this line integral has vanished, therefore <i>B</i> times
that length and <i>B</i> times that length going the opposite way must be equal
in magnitude. That means the <i>B</i> here must be as strong as the <i>B</i>
there. </p>
<p>So <i>B</i> doesn't
vary when you leave the wire. Well, I can keep on repeating this argument
until I go all the way to infinity, but I know <i>B</i>is 0. Therefore coming
from infinity inwards, <i>B</i> is going to be 0 everywhere here. That's only
true for an infinite solenoid. If you take a finite solenoid, there will be
lines coming in here. For an infinite solenoid, is when the lines always go
perpendicularly. See, in a finite solenoid, you sort of know the lines will do
this, right? They'll be perpendicular here, but they could be at an angle
there. But for an infinite solenoid, every portion looks like you are here.
The lines are only vertical, they have no choice but to vanish. So the flux
actually goes out and returns on a sphere of infinity. So we only have to find
the magnetic field inside. So then you've got to do the right hand rule and
the right hand rule tells you the magnetic field looks like that. And the
question is, how big is it? </p>
<p>Once again, I want to
argue that the magnetic field is constant inside the solenoid. Now atleast now
you should be able to guess what argument I will use. The argument will be,
take an Amperian loop like this one. The two sides, this and that, do not
contribute because they are perpendicular to the field. These two better make
cancelling contributions. And that's going up and that's going down. For them
to cancel, the strength of the field here must be the same as the strength
here. So we have a result of the magnetic field as some number inside and 0
outside and we're trying to find the one number. This is going to be the case
whenever you use Ampere's law to get anything. </p>
<p>In the end, Ampere's
law is a single statement about the magnetic field. You can get only one piece
of information from it. If you reduced your problem to the point where there's
only one thing you do not know, you can find that one thing. Here I've talked
my way out of the field in this region and that region, and here it's constant,
and it's got a known direction. Only thing I don't know is, how big is it? To
find how big it is, you can take a loop like this. Let me take a loop like
this one. Let me repeat that for you. So here is the current coming out and I
want to take a loop like this. I want the loop to have length <i>l</i>. So the magnetic
field is some number <i>B</i> there which I don&#39;t know. It is 0 on the outside
and I never care about these sides because they're perpendicular. So the line
integral will be <i>B</i> times <i>l</i>.going up, nothing there, 0 times<i> l</i>.going down and
nothing here. That's the whole line integral, <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i>.. That = &#956;<sub>0</sub>
times the current crossing the loop. Now here's where you should not make the
mistake of saying there's a current <i>I</i> flowing in the wire and therefore
it's equal to <i>I</i>. Can you tell me what's wrong with that logic? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's coiling
around so you have to count the number of coils.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You understand that? First of all, if you just walked into the class now,
first of all, you're in trouble. Secondly, if you just walked into the class
and you saw this picture and you knew all about Ampere's law, did not know
anything about solenoid, nothing, what will you do? You'll say, &quot;Here's a
loop, current's coming out. I just count the current coming in.&quot; The
fact that these guys all belong to a big solenoid and they wrap around is
irrelevant. All that matters for the Ampere's loop is how much amps are coming
at me or going away from me. </p>
<p>So the fact that
they're all part of one gigantic loop is irrelevant. So you've got to count the
number of turns that got trapped in this length <i>l</i>.  So we use the symbol
small <i>n</i>, which is the number of turns per unit length. Then it's going
to be number of turns per unit length times <i>l</i>. So that depends on how tightly you
wound the coil. If you wound 100 turns per centimeter, well, it's whatever,
10,000 turns per meter. Now one nice thing is that this <i>l</i> cancels.
Again, I want you to think about why <i>l</i> should cancel. Why shouldn't the
answer depend on<i> l</i>? This happens even when you do Gauss's law, when you
take some surface, the details of the surface cancel out always. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
More turns of the wire. But the more important thing is, the question that was
given to us was a solenoid. It had some number of turns. It had a certain
current. And the answer should only depend on the current and how densely it
is wound. This <i>l</i>. was my own
artifact. The Amperian loop is not a real loop. I made it up. So the answer
I get for <i>B</i> cannot depend on whether I took that loop or that loop or
that loop. They should all give the same answer. That's why the properties of
the loop should cancel out and you should get in the end a result that depends
only on the intrinsic variables in the problem. </p>
<p>So this is a very
useful result. That's why we draw a box around it. That means important. The
field inside a solenoid is &#956;<sub>0</sub> times the number of turns per unit
length, times the current flowing to the solenoid. I'll be invoking this
result all the time. It's one of the few results I carry in my head. Normally
I encourage you not to carry too much stuff in your head, but this guy's pretty
helpful. </p>
<p>So here's another
solenoid that people have, which is better than this one in the following
sense. As long as you make a finite solenoid--in real life, everything is
finite--you will have this return flux. There's a trick by which you can keep
all the flux hidden inside the tube, by wrapping the tube into a doughnut. So
take the long tube and glue the ends together, then you have a solenoid which is
like a doughnut on which you wrap the wire. I've shown you a few turns. So
you wrap it all the way round and you come back and you drive the current from
here. Are you guys with me? The cross section of the doughnut can be
circular, it can be square. It doesn&#39;t matter what it is. Sometimes it even
contains some metal or iron, which I'm not showing you. It's fine. Even if
it's an empty tube, you wrap the wire around it. But now the flux lines go
like this along the tube. So let me take a problem where the cross section is
actually a square, in other words, it looks like this. I cut the doughnut
right there and I slice it and I look at it, and you have the flux lines doing
that. That's the cross section. So which way is the flux going? Well, you've
got to figure out again with the right hand rule, the way I've shown the
currents, if you do this around the wire, the flux is actually going like that
here. </p>
<p>Our job is to find
out what is the magnetic field inside that doughnut. For that, I'm going to
slice the doughnut the way you normally slice a doughnut. You normally slice a
doughnut so it looks like this. This is half the doughnut, okay? You cut it,
then let's say the wire looks like that one. That guy is coming in, coming out
of the board, going into the board, coming out of the board, going into the
board. Yes? Can you see that? If you take a doughnut with a wire wrapped
around it and you cut it, it's going to look like this. Now the important
thing to notice is that we haven't really cut that doughnut. If you really cut
the doughnut, there's going to be no current. This is a mental slice you make.
Then you ask yourself, now what do you think is going to be the Amperian loop?
Can you make a guess what the loop will look like? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It will look like
a piece of pie.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
A piece of pie. We're all getting hungry now. I've talked about doughnuts.
Which pie?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It will have it so
that the sides perpendicular to the--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Oh, okay. Maybe you could do that, but here is what the general consensus, 9
out of 10 physicists use this contour. This is going to be the Amperian loop.
Then what can you say? The loop has some radius <i>r</i>, so once again, 2<i>&Pi;r</i>
times <i>B</i> is &#956;<sub>0</sub><i>I</i> times the number of turns altogether in
the solenoid. You understand? Because this loop cuts through every turn of
wire. As far as the direction is concerned, it will go like this. The field
will go this way. So the magnetic field here is &#956;<sub>0</sub><i>IN</i> divided
by 2<i>&Pi;r</i>. So the field actually gets weaker, so that if you cut this
doughnut, the field on the inner rim will be stronger than the field on the
outer rim. And if you go inside the inner rim, you'll get 0; outside the outer
rim, you'll get 0 because any loop you draw on the contour will intersect an
equal number of incoming and outgoing currents. </p>
<p>So <i>B</i> is going
to vanish outside the doughnut, and it's going to be non-zero right inside the
heart of the doughnut, and the strength will be this. Now if this doughnut had
a radius of say 1 light year, you can ask what will happen to the formula. You
should be ready for what you expect. Take a doughnut 10 miles long, 10 miles
in circumference. What do you hope the formula to give? Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It should approach
the results of the infinite solenoid.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
For infinite solenoid, because the circle of radius 10 zillion miles, for most
purposes, it's like a straight tube, right? You cannot tell it's going around
in a circle. Let's see if that happens. Well, you can see the field is &#956;<sub>0</sub><i>NI</i>,
divided by 2<i>&Pi;r</i> is just the circumference of the circle. So it's going
to be &#956;<sub>0</sub> little <i>n</i> times <i>I</i>, because little <i>n</i> is
big <i>N</i> divided by 2<i>&Pi;r</i>. See that? This 2<i>&Pi;r</i> will-- in other
words, you cut it here and you open it into a solenoid, its length will be 2<i>&Pi;r</i>,
and the number of turns per unit length will be big <i>N</i> over 2<i>&Pi;r</i>.
But that's an approximation, because in a real finite system, the magnetic
field is not uniform. There's a slight variation from this end to that end.
But if this thickness is 2 inches and that radius is 37 miles, that variation
is negligible and it becomes that other easier result.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> How did you get
the small n again?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
We got the small n because this guy. This is the total number of turns wrapped
around the solenoid and 2<i>&Pi;r</i> is the circumference, right? So number of
turns divided by the circumference will be the number of turns per unit
length. In other words, if it was a huge solenoid, so huge that it looked like
a straight line to you from your range of observation, the number of turns it
would have per unit length would be exactly this much. So it will look like a
straight solenoid to you, but it's curving around on a big scale. </p>
<p>All right, so this
marks the end of one topic. So I'm going to write down over and over what we
know, because I think I talked to some of you people, and I asked you, what's
the part you find difficult. And one thing I heard, which is very reasonable,
is the amount of stuff you're learning every day. This is just a lot of
stuff. &quot;Drinking out of the fire hose&quot; was an expression that came
up. You drink and you drink and you drink and I keep throwing stuff at you. I
would like it to end. It's almost going to end, but it's not over yet. But
I'll tell you where things stand now. All of electrostatics and magnetostatics
are summarized by the following equations. I'm going to write them again and
again. <i>E&#8901;dA</i> is the charge
inside. Line integral of <i>E&#8901;dl</i>. or <i>dr</i>--I forgot what I called it--that is 0.
Surface integral of the magnetic field is 0 because there are no magnetic
charges. The line integral of the magnetic field is mu 0 times all the current
inside. That's it. And the force--after all, who cares about <i>E</i>and <i>B</i>,
except for this great equation, which tells you that if a charged particle goes
into a region with electric and magnetic fields, this will be the force acting
on it. That's very important. That&#39;s why we care about <i>E</i> and <i>B</i>,
because they make things happen. </p>
<p>So the cycle of
physics will proceed as follows: this is all for statics. That means <i>J</i>
is constant and rho is constant. So somebody has to give you the currents and
somebody has to give you the charges. Then it's a purely mathematical problem
to solve for the electric and magnetic fields. And I was telling you yesterday
a fact that may not be obvious, that these equations suffice to determine
electric and magnetic fields, given the cause of electric and magnetic fields,
which is currents and charges. </p>
<p>Okay, so now we are
going to do--let me ask you something. When do we keep on modifying the
equations? I think I explained that to you. Why don't we stop now? Any idea
why I'm going to modify the stuff? Do you know? Do you know when we modify
equations? What could be wrong with this equation? Who can convince me it's
wrong? Any idea? I'm not talking about a particular thing, but I'm talking in
general, what makes people modify their equations. Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> New experiment.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
New experiment. That's the only reason you modify your results. If these
things worked, and it could have been a very consistent world in which it
worked, but it is not the whole story. At least one reason it's not the whole
story is, rho and <i>J</i> are not always constant. You can have charges
shaking around and you can have currents. You turn them on and off as you
wish. One thing is to hope that this continues to describe them even in this
situation. The fact that we derive them from steady currents and densities
doesn&#39;t mean it has to fail when they are changing with time, but there is no
guarantee that they won't change. So I&#39;m going to now lead you through the
experiments that forced us to change some of these equations. So these are
called Maxwell's equations, but they're not the real Maxwell equations, because
they're not valid for the time dependent case. I'm going to start the
phenomenon, then we'll see where the trouble begins. </p>
<p>So let's take a
problem where I have a uniform magnetic field going into the board. This goes
on forever, but it doesn't go beyond this point. I've only shown you that
much. Now I'm going to take a loop of wire like this. It's got some width w
and maybe some length <i>l</i><i>.</i>. And I put a little
light bulb here. Then I drag this to the right with some speed <i>V.</i> And
this magnetic field <i>B</i> going into the blackboard. Now if the loop is not
moving, nothing will happen. If the loop is moving, something does happen.
Now I'm going to ask you what happens, because this is something you must
know. What happens when I drag the loop? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The light bulb
will go on.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Good. The light bulb will go on is the answer that you've got to give. You
may not know by how much and whatnot. But first of all, why would I draw a
light bulb if it's not going to go on? That's how you should reason. That's
how my kids did all their SATs. They asked extraneous questions. One of them
is, you put the light bulb because it's going to glow. So you can ask
yourself, what's going on? Why is the light bulb glowing? Is it some new
physics? The answer is, whenever youwant a light bulb to glow, you're looking
for a battery. There is no battery in the circuit. And yet there is an emf,
because every time a charge makes one full turn and comes around, it has
delivered some work, because that's what makes this thing glow. You're
constantly pumping energy into the resistor inside your bulb. And who's
providing the energy? These charges are going round and round doing some
work. That means something is pushing them around this loop. We defined the
emf to be the line integral of any force per unit charge pushing them around
the loop. This is per unit charge. That's got to be not 0. So what is that
force, and what is the emf is what I want to ask. Do you know what the force
might be? And why does it kick in only when I move the loop? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The force is the
magnetic force that we wrote.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> force. That's because there's a <i>v</i> here, <i>B</i>
into the blackboard. <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> looks like that. The force is <i>v</i>
x <i>B</i> and it acts only here. Let's understand why. If you come to this
portion, if you take this <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>, this <i>v</i> is this way, and <i>B</i>
is into the board, <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is perpendicular to the wire. But
charges cannot go--even if there's a force perpendicular to the wire, it
doesn't contribute to the emf, which I found by going along the loop. So <i>dr</i>
is along the loop. The only way to get that to contribute is to have a force
along the loop. That's only here and it's not here. So the whole force is non-zero
only in that segment. So its line integral is equal to simply the force, which
is <i>Bv</i> times <i>w</i>. That's the emf. Any time a charge goes around
the loop once, that amount of work is being done. </p>
<p>Okay, so that
explains it. We're not in any kind of trouble. In fact, we understand this
problem completely without bringing in any new stuff. But there's one
paradox. We were told the magnetic field doesn't do any work. You remember
that? And yet here is a magnetic field pushing these charges and getting
things done. So what can be going on there?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It takes work to
move the whole loop.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It takes work to move the loop. That is certainly true, but how about the fact
that the magnetic field manages to do some work? Is that a problem for you or
not? Remember, the original argument for why it doesn&#39;t do any work is, the
force is <i>v</i>x <i>B</i> and the power is the velocity times the force and
it's 0, because <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is perpendicular to <i>v</i>. But here, <i>v</i>
x <i>B</i> is this way, and the charge is moving this way. It looks like we
got some work done. </p>
<p>Okay, so the answer
is that this is not the full--there are two kinds of velocities. If you have a
current in the wire, the charges are also moving in the wire at some speed <i>u</i>.
So the real velocity has got the velocity because the whole loop is moving, <i>v</i>,
and the fact the current is moving this way, <i>u</i>, and <i>w</i>, if you
like, is the true velocity. And <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is actually in that
direction. That is <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>, perpendicular to <i>w</i>. So let me
draw the picture for you. <i>w</i> and <i>w</i> x <i>B</i>. <i>w</i> is made
up of two parts. It's got a part <i>v</i>here, it's got a part <i>u</i>
here. So the magnetic force is not just along the wire. It's really at this
strange angle. And we can easily find out how much of the force is this part
and how much of the force is this part. The force here will be--let me see.
It will depend on the other component, so it will depend on--yes, the force
here is <i>B</i> times <i>v</i> and the power is that times <i>u</i>. The
power is <i>Bvu</i>, due to this portion. But in this side, if you ask what's
the power delivered by that component, it is <i>B</i> times <i>u</i> times <i>v</i>,
but with a - sign. In other words, if you resolve this <i>w</i> x <i>B</i> into
two parts, the vertical force is due to the horizontal velocity, and the power
is that times the vertical velocity <i>u</i>. The horizontal force is due to
the vertical velocity. That's how the cross product works. </p>
<p>So when you're done,
both are equal to <i>B</i> times <i>u</i> times <i>v</i>. But this is + and
this is -. In other words, in the end, it would like to move the charge this
way, because that's the force, but it manages to move it along the wire this
way. It would like to move it this way, but it's force to go oppositely. So a
force trying to move this way, this part it is doing work, but this part it is
not doing work. It has work done on it, because we forced the electrons to
move to the right. Of course, that energy comes from the person pulling the
rod, pulling this loop, because every charge that has this force, it won't just
move unless you pull it, and the force you apply is really coming from you that
balances the magnetic force. So there's yet another force. That's the force
due to me, and I'm pulling this to balance this part of the force. So what is
the role of the magnetic field? It doesn't do any work, but you need it here,
because one component of the magnetic field does work. </p>
<p>The other component
has work done on it. So it takes with one hand and gives with the other hand,
but you need that. It's no used saying, &quot;I'm not very impressed because I
did all the hard work.&quot; You did all the hard work by grabbing this loop
and pulling it, but I challenge you to go and push the individual electrons so
they can move down the wire. You cannot even see those little guys, right? But
the magnetic field does that for you. So it takes macroscopic mechanical
power, turns into microscopic energy supplied to the electrons. Even though
the field did not profit in the end, it just delivered to the electrons what
you gave them, you need that field to do a transfer from something you can see
and pull to something you cannot see, right? I mean, I give you a light bulb
and you've got all the muscles in your hand. Let's see you make it glow. You
cannot say, &quot;I have the energy.&quot; There's no way to transfer it.
That's the role of the magnetic field, so you shouldn't say it's no use.
Anyway, we got that answer. </p>
<p>I'm going to give you
another equivalent way to explain the balance of energy. We all know that the
energy is coming, because once the loop carries a current, it's going to be
hard for you to pull the loop, so you've got to do some work, and that will
explain the power usage here. So let's calculate the power two ways. The power
in the resistor = emf squared over <i>R</i>. emf squared is <i>B<sup>2</sup>v<sup>2</sup>W<sup>2</sup>/R</i>.
Now how about the power that I provide? What's the power I provide? I'm
pulling this leg of the wire here. The force on anything, you remember, is <i>BwI</i>,
and I pull it with a force <i>v</i>, with a velocity <i>v</i>. That's the
power. So it is <i>Bwv</i> times<i> I</i>. <i>I </i>= emf divided by <i>R</i>.
But if you put the emf that we just got, you will get this. So they will
match. So do you understand how this thing works? This is a generator, if you
like. If you want to light the bulb in your house, one option is to set up a
magnetic field, take the light bulb and connect it to a rectangle, and grab it
and keep running. As long as you're running, the light bulb will be glowing.
When do you think it will stop glowing? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I'm sorry, what
does that word say?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
This one? The power that I provide. Okay, I'm just balancing the power loss
in the resistor. Are you with me now? You understand the two things? I take
the force I apply on the wire, multiply by the velocity with which I pull.
That's the power. Likewise I take <i>I<sup>2</sup>R</i>. That's the electric
power dissipated. And of course, they balance. Notice that once the loop is
fully inside the magnetic field, the light bulb will stop glowing. Do you know
why? Can you see why? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Because the flux
in the loop isn't changing any more.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> No, no. You're
pulling new laws, in terms of what I've told you.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The magnetic
field, there's no new field coming through the wire. The field is constant
that's coming through the wire.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Just use what we've used so far. Yes</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The field is
acting on the left segment.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. In other words, without invoking any new ideas, once this piece gets
into the loop, it's going to have a <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>there and a<b> v</b> x <i>B</i>
there. Which way should the current go? In fact, it won't go anywhere,
because the line integral of this will be 0. You will get contribution from
there, and - the contribution from there. So we can demolish this problem. You
understand it completely. It doesn't pose any difficulties. And it does not
give any grounds to monkey with those equations. </p>
<p>And now comes the bad
news. Suppose I go to a frame of reference moving with the loop. It may well
be that the loop was just there, and I hired a couple of guys to carry a magnet
and run under my house, right? And also, my light bulb will glow, and I don't
have to go anywhere. They will carry the magnet. Now you realize that you're
certainly entitled to see it from that frame of reference. Now if you believe
in relativity, that means a person should be able to say from the point of view
of the loop, &quot;I'm not moving. Someone's carrying the magnet and running
with it.&quot; But the light bulb must glow. Lots of things are relative, but
whether a light bulb is glowing or not is not relative. You can go to any
frame of reference. A glowing light bulb is a glowing light bulb. We don't
know how much power it consumes and so on, but the fact that it's on and
glowing is undeniable. </p>
<p>So how is the person
in that fixed loop supposed to understand the glowing of the light bulb? What
do you do, what do you say, in terms of anything? Why are charges going
around? I'm a static loop. Okay, someone's moving with the magnet, but
there's no <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> force because nobody's moving in my loop. The
magnet's irrelevant. Of course, there's one difference. This magnet is not
like the usual problem, because it's a changing magnetic field, whereas
previously you had a static magnetic field. So you might say, &quot;Well,
maybe the force on a charge due to moving magnetic field is different from its
force due to changing magnetic field.&quot; But that's not acceptable, because
if you believe in the reality of the field, what it does at a given point
depends on its value. It doesn't depend on anything else. But I still haven't
explained why charges like to go around a wire now. So what force could be
pushing them? What force do you think will push them around a loop? Yes?
Would you like to guess? Yes, you.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> The magnetic field
is changing with time. You agree that the loop is going to be fixed, and a
little later, it will look like this, and so on, right? But that's not going
to move the current around the wire, because the magnetic field has no cross
product with anything. So what's the only thing that can make the charges move
around the wire now? What made them move in the DC circuit?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Electric field.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Electric field. Look, I want you to understand that these equations carry a
large amount of information, and they in fact carry everything as far as you
need to know. The only force on a charge is either <i>E</i> or <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>.
That's it. If <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> is out, it's <i>E</i>. I mean, there may be
brand new phenomena. It turns out that we don&#39;t need anything else. <i>E</i>
and <i>B</i> will do. In which case, what are we saying? We are saying that
in the other frame of reference, where the loop is fixed and the magnet is
moving, there is an electric field. Not only that, it's an electric field
whose line integral is not 0, because it is still true that charges in the loop
are going round and round and doing work, and someone's providing work for
every charge that goes around the loop. And the emf is the work done on a unit
charge. </p>
<p>So this makes us
believe now that whenever there's a changing magnetic field, there is an
electric field. This is an electric field of brand new origin. All the
electric fields you studied before were produced by charges, by coulombs
force. This says, without the help of any charge. Charges are nowhere to be
found. They could be infinitely far. If I change the magnetic field, I'm
going to get an electric field. Of course, we have to find out what is the
connection. How much electric field do you get? How is it connected to the
magnetic field? These are things you have to deduce and you cannot deduce them
from logic. You can deduce them only from experiment. Certain things come
from logic. If you have an equation, you solve it using mathematics. If you like,
that's a kind of logic. Or you use symmetry and say, &quot;If I turn the wire
and it looks the same, the answer should look the same&quot; and so on. But
what electric field should be produced by changing magnetic field you cannot
derive from pure logic. </p>
<p>If you combine it
with other principles like relativity, you could try to get them, but right
now, with what we have, we just know that in the moving frame--look, you don't
need Einstein to tell you this. Even before Einstein, you knew that you're
certainly free to imagine a loop being fixed and somebody moving the magnet.
And everything in you tells you the answer's got to be the same, because in the
end, it's the relative motion between the loop and the magnet that decides. And
if you provide the same relative motion, you've got to get the same answer. And
the only way to get that is to say when there's a changing magnetic field, I
have an electric field, and furthermore, electric field which is no longer
conservative because its line integral is not 0. </p>
<p>So we've got to find
out what it is. So I'm going to tell you now an equation that really answers
that question, and we cannot derive it. It's a summary of a lot of
experiment. And that says that the electromotive force--in fact, due to
electric and magnetic origin, em = -<i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i>, and I'll tell you what this equation
means. So you take a loop, some contour c, and you define &#934; to be equal to the
integral of the magnetic field on a surface whose boundary is this loop.
That's called the magnetic flux. So you know operationally how to calculate
it. Take any surface you want. It may be a flat one, a bulging one, doesn&#39;t
matter. Take the flux going through any surface with that as the boundary, and
find its rate of change, and that will be equal to the electromotive force. In
fact, you just write <i>E</i> electromotive force, = -<i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i>. So you know
operationally how to find this thing, right? Now again, you may ask,
&quot;Which surface do you want to take for a given loop?&quot; This flat one
or the curvy one or the one with more bumps in it? The answer is, again, it
does not matter. </p>
<p>The reason is the
same. If you've got some magnetic lines coming through this guy, they also
have to come out through that guy because they don&#39;t stop. Magnetic field
lines that enter one surface have to also enter another one with the same edge,
because they cannot escape. So you can take any surface you like. So whenever
you have these laws where a surface is invoked, and it's ambiguous and not
defined by the perimeter, the answer is, it doesn't matter which surface. The
reason is that field lines don't stop and end, therefore whatever enters this
surface has to leave this. If you had magnetic monopoles, the lines can enter
this and terminate on a negative monopole, then of course it won't be true, but
you don't have that. </p>
<p>Now this - sign has
got the name Lenz attached to it, and this thing is called Faraday. Faraday
and Lenz. And I will tell you what the - sign due to Lenz means. Lenz's law
tells you that if you change the magnetic flux in a system, there's going to be
a very long sentence. If you take the magnetic flux in a system and it
changes, it will induce an emf which, if it could drive a current, will do so
in order to fight that change. That's why it's a long statement. In other
words, if you had a real circuit and you shove it into region of changing
field, an emf will start driving a current. That current itself will produce
its own magnetic field. Which way will it point? The answer is, it will point
it such a way as to neutralize the change. </p>
<p>For example, if you
took a loop and it had some flux going through it, if you tried to increase the
flux going through it, it will try to decrease it, so the current will flow
like that. If you try to decrease the flux through it, it will try to prop it
up to its old value. The current will go like that. That helps you find the
direction of the current. The emf will be such as to neutralize the change.
It does not necessarily oppose the external field, the magnetic field. It
opposes the change in the magnetic field. That's what I want you to
understand. For example, suppose I've got lines coming out here. And they get
weaker, namely some source of magnetism makes the lines weaker. Then the
current will start going this way to prop up the thing back to its old value.
That's what you have to understand. That's the meaning of the - sign and
that's going to guide us much better than all the cross products. </p>
<p>Now I will show you
that with this one law, you can explain everything. In other words, you can
explain the wire, the current loop moving in the magnetic field, in the
laboratory frame, in which the magnet was at rest and the loop was moving, or
in the loop frame, where the loop was at rest and the magnet was moving. You
can explain everything with this one great law. It's a remarkable law. And
you just have to say, we got it from experiment. I'm going to tell you how it
explains everything. So let's go back to this loop. By the way, some of you
gave that answer, so it was not the wrong answer. I mean, I think it's
perfectly valid, except that I did not want you to use something we had not
done yet, but from this moment on, it's a valid answer. So I'm going to give
you the other explanation. So here is my field. I think I had everybody going
in, right? </p>
<p>Here is the thing-- so
I want you to know what I'm trying to do now. I'm trying to tell you that this
one law will explain the loop going through the field in both frames of
reference. So first I'm going to do the easy part. When there's a fixed
magnetic field and I'm dragging the loop. I'm not going to worry about + and -
signs, because I will get that in the end. Let us ask, what is the flux
penetrating this loop? Can you see that it's just the magnetic field times the
width of the loop times the length of the loop that is inside? Not the whole
length, but the length of the loop that is still inside the magnetic field.
That's a very simple result. <i>B </i>times <i>A</i> is the flux. </p>
<p>Now let's take the
time derivative of this, <i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i>. <i>B</i> is not changing, <i>w</i> is not
changing, but <i>l</i> is changing, because
when I move the loop, the rate of change of <i>l</i> is just the velocity of the loop.
But that's exactly the emf we got before. Now the only thing is with the -
sign, let's figure out if the sign is correct. This has got magnetic flux
going into the board. When you pull the loop to the right, you've got less
magnetic field going into the board. Therefore the current should flow in such
a way as to continue the flux. So which way should the current flow? So if
I'm pulling the loop--I'm sorry. I've got the loop drawn backwards. This is
okay too. Let's take this loop and pull it to the right with a velocity <i>v</i>.
So the flux into the board is increasing, right? So it should produce flux
coming out of the board now to compensate that. That means the current has to
flow like this. See that? </p>
<p>When the current
flows like this, you'll start producing upward flux. In other words, you're
getting more and more flux into the loop going into the board. To cancel it, I
will produce flux coming out of the board. That's what the loop tells you.
That way you don't have to worry about all the cross products. At the very
end, you ask what's happening to the flux? How do I keep it from changing? And
the answer is, you keep it, in this case, from changing by producing flux
coming out of the blackboard. And finally, remember when the loop is entirely
inside, there's going to be no more emf, because the flux through it is not
changing. Because in the beginning, as it moves to the right, it's gaining more
and more flux from the back end of it, but once it's fully in, it's not getting
any more flux, so the current will stop flowing. That comes from this
argument, from this way of thinking, that <i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i> is 0. So in other
words, I've given you something that I say is a new law. The law says the rate
of change of flux = emf, but so far, it doesn&#39;t look very new, because
everything it gave you, you were able to get without this law, right? We
managed to understand the loop completely. </p>
<p>So is there any new
information in this? And that's what I'm going to talk about. The new
information's going to come in when I eventually use it to understand the
answer in the moving frame of reference, namely, what's the electric field
produced by changing magnetic field? That's also contained in this one. But
I'm just telling you, this part of it is a letdown, because it's not very
impressive. It gave you an emf you can get from the <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>. It
is just <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> all over again. </p>
<p>But let's see what
is new. To really find what is new, we have to take this problem and apply it
to the very general case of a loop. Here is some loop. I'm going to have the
loop actually move in time. Take a loop in one shape. A little later, it's
got another shape. And the magnetic field is free to change. I'm going to
take a very general situation. The loop is moving, field is changing. So let's
say this surface is <i>S<sub>1</sub></i> and a little later there's a surface <i>S<sub>2</sub></i>.
You should imagine this is stacked on top of this. Maybe I should hide that
part. Here is this surface, and it's moved to a new location. Now this
surface, let me call <i>S</i> and let me call <i>S + &#916;s </i>and you will see
what I mean by <i>S + &#916;S</i>. You can build up that surface by taking this
surface and gluing to it this edge. Is that clear or not clear? Not clear. </p>
<p>Let me take a simpler
surface than this one. Here is a surface, here is another surface. So one is a
cylinder with the round sides on the bottom. The other is the top. Do you
agree, they are both surfaces with the same boundary? Are you with me there?
This top loop can either take the top of the cylinder as its boundary, or it's
a hollow cylinder, the curvy side and the flat bottom, are also another surface
with the same boundary. But I can think of the second surface as essentially
the old surface + the sides. So you agree that <i>S&#39; = S + &#916;S</i>, where delta
<i>S </i>is the stuff you glue on the side to the old surface to make up the
new surface. Yes or no? I think the cylinder is the easiest one. I tried more
ambitiously to draw this, but here is the simpler case. </p>
<p>So now the question
is, what is the rate of change of flux in this problem? So the rate of change
of flux I'm going to find as follows. I'm going to find the flux at time <i>t
+ &#916;t</i> - phi at time <i>t</i>. That's what I want. Now at time <i>t + &#916;t</i>,
my loop is here, but I'm going to use, rather than that surface, I'm going to
use the old surface + the patch job to make it into the new surface. So
therefore, I want the magnetic field, <i>B</i> at <i>t+&#916;t</i> on the surface <i>S+&#916;S</i>
- the integral of the magnetic field, <i>dA</i> on the old surface at time <i>t.</i>
This part is quite subtle and it took me a while, when I first learned it, to
understand what the point was. See,the surface used to be the bottom half of
the cylinder, the bottom plate. The new surface is the top plate. So natural
instinct will be, let's find <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>v</i> as on the top face, but we don&#39;t want to do it that
way. We purposely want to take another surface with the same boundary, because
we're allowed to. That is the old boundary + the vertical sides. That's the
main point. You take the old boundary because it's going to make it easy for
you to cancel some of the stuff with some of this. That's why. So <i>B(t+&#916;t)&#8901;dA</i>, you can write it as
<i>B(t+&#916;t)&#8901;dA</i> on <i>S</i> +
integral <i>B(t)&#8901;dA</i> on <i>&#916;S</i>. In
other words, the surface integral is changing for two reasons. The surface
itself, the loop itself around which you take the line integral is changing,
and the fields themselves may be changing with time. So they can both contribute
to the change. </p>
<p>And I've broken up
into two parts. One says take <i>B</i> at time <i>t + &#916;t</i> on the same old
surface, and then take <i>B&#8901;dA</i> on the incremental surface, and subtract from it <i>B(t)&#8901;dA</i>on the old surface.
So do you guys see that? Phi of <i>t + &#916;t</i><b> </b>I've written as two
parts. One is the flux on the lower face, but at a later time, and the flux on
the curvy sides. Now on the curvy side, you don't have to worry about whether
it's at a later time or at an earlier time, because<i> &#916;S</i> is first ordered
in time. It's proportional to <i>&#916;t</i>, and this difference is going to be
proportional to <i>&#916;t</i>, so you don't have to worry about the change in time
over an infinitesimal surface, because that's second ordered in time. </p>
<p>So now I have to
bring all that stuff over here. So I'm going to say the change in &#934; = <i>dB/dt </i>times
<i>dA</i>, <i>&#916;t</i> on the old surface, + here is the stuff we have to do
that's extra. So do you understand how I cancel <i>B(t+&#916;t) &#8722; B(t)</i>, that's
given by the rate of change of <i>B</i> with time, times the change in time? </p>
<p>You get their
contribution only because <i>B</i> is changing with time, because you're taking
the very same surface, as you did the first time, but at a later time.
Therefore the difference is due to the rate of change. But now we have to do
the second part, which is, on the surface <i>&#916;s,</i> we want to take <i>B&#8901;dA</i>. Now what is <i>&#916;S</i>?
Let me see. So I will have to draw the picture like this. So here's one
surface, here's another surface, and I've gone from here to here. I've gone
from this loop to this loop in a time <i>&#916;t</i>. This is my segment of the
loop, and that's the distance, <i>v&#916;t</i>. So the area vector associated with
this section is just <i>v</i>&#916;t x <i>dl</i>. That is the surface area. You see that? A parallelogram
formed with the loop size <i>dl</i> here and the distance traveled in <i>dt</i>.
Area of that is just the cross product. So this = 1 + <i>v</i> (I'm going to
put the &#916;v outside) <i>v</i> x <i>dl</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>B</i>. </p>
<p>So I'm not going to
touch this expression. I'm going to fiddle with this for a while. Cancel <i>dt</i>
everywhere if you like, divide by <i>dt.</i> Forget that and forget that.
Then I get <i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i> = <i>d</i><i>B</i>/<i>dt
</i>&#8901;<i>dA</i> on the surface, +
the line integral of <i>v</i> x <i>dl</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>B</i>. Do you understand the last part what I did? The extra
surface that you got here is made up of little rectangular tiles with the one end
being <i>dl,</i> other end being <i>Bdt</i>. The area vector comes like that,
the magnetic field may look like that, and the dot product of the two is what I
have as the extra flux coming out of the curvy side of the surface. Now you
should know enough about cross products to know that this cross product is the
same as <i>dl</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>B</i> x <i>v</i>, because
you can rotate the factors in an <i>A</i> x <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>C</i> is <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>C</i>x <i>A</i>, is <i>C</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>A</i>x <i>B</i>. I've done
that once. But then this = - the integral <i>dl</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>v</i>x <i>B</i>. So I'm
going to write down what I have. What I have is that the rate of change of
flux, <i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i> = -<i>dB/dt</i>
times the area + - integral <i>v</i> x <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i>. I'm sorry, it's <i>d/dt</i>
+ that. Therefore &#8722;<i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i>, we'll have a - sign
here and a + sign here. So just write the formula for &#8722;<i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt</i>. Put a - on
everything here. </p>
<p>This is what I want
you to know. Now you've got to go home and you have to think about this. I
don't claim it&#39;s easy. I will also tell you something. If you really don't
want to know everything, you don't have to follow this particular detail. I'm
going to tell you what I get out of this. That's what you have to know. I want
to make sure that if you want to follow everything, you're given a chance. So
here's what I get from the old Faraday and Lenz law. This says that rate of
change of flux has two parts. You take a contour and you find theflux changing through it, it's got two parts. One, because the
field itself is changing over the region. Second, because the loop itself is
changing. And together, they make these two contributions. But emf = -
integral of all the electric forces and the magnetic forces. That's = -(<i>dB/dt</i>)<i>dA</i>
+ integral <i>v</i> x <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i>. Now here's something very beautiful to look at. It
says the rate of change of flux by miracle manages to measure the line integral
of the electric field and the magnetic field. And the rate of change of flux
contains two parts. The second part is really the <i>v</i> x <i>B</i> force
that comes because the contour itself is moving, the wire itself is moving. So
you balance this term with this term. If this is all you were looking at,
there's nothing new in the equation. That's why I said we're not impressed,
because it's just the <i>v</i> x <i>B</i>. But the real beauty is, when you
cancel these terms and you look at what it says here, that says line integral
of <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i> = - rate of change
of <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><b>dA</b>. The meaning of the
partial derivative is that <i>B</i> can depend on <i>x, y, z</i>, and <i>t,</i>
but this is only due to change in <i>t</i>. Only due to change in <i>t</i>
because I did the integral on the same surface, only a little later. This is
called Faraday's law. You can see that because of Faraday's law, one of the
four equations I wrote hidden somewhere here, in which the line integral of <i>E</i>
is 0 is no longer 0. So this finally tells you that in general, if you take
the line integral of the electric field around a closed loop, you will not get
0 if the magnetic flux through that loop is changing. But this has nothing to
do whatsoever with a real conducting loop any more. </p>
<p>See, this formula has
a lot to do with the conducting loop, because <i>v</i> is the velocity of the
portion <i>d</i><i>l</i>, as the loop moves
through space. But the loop has been banished from the two sides. These
equations have nothing to do with any loop. They just say take a fixed contour
in space and the line integral of <i>E</i> on that contour is the rate of
change of flux. It's an intrinsic relation between electric and magnetic
fields, not having anything to do with conductors. It's a property of <i>E</i>
and <i>B</i>, namely that a changing <i>B</i> can produce a circulating <i>E</i>.
That's the content of this equation. </p>
<p>Therefore you can
sort of imagine how that loop problem is going to work out. So let's go to the
frame of reference in which the loop is fixed, but somebody is carrying the
magnet around. So what happens a little later? A little later, the pattern of
magnetic fields has shifted like that, right? It's a changing magnetic field.
That will be circulating electric field, guaranteed. So if you go to that
frame, in fact I will tell you what the electric field will look like. It will
look like this. In the frame in which the loop is at rest and the guy with the
magnet is running, at the interface where the magnetic field ends will begin a
new bunch of electric field lines. You can see the line integral of that
electric field on certain loops as 0 and on certain loops as not 0. If you
took a line integral of that on this loop, you will get 0 because these two
sides cancel. But if you took it on a loop like this, it won't cancel, because
we've got an electric field here, we've got nothing here. </p>
<p>Therefore this is the
configuration of electric fields that are generated by changing magnetic field.
In other words, I claim, if you manage to somehow create these magnetic field
lines and run with it, in your frame of reference, you'll be running into those
electric field lines going down. They'll be produced by the changing magnetic
field. That's the cause of the emf. The bottom line is, a changing field
produces an electric field, and we can actually calculate the electric field
sometimes using that equation. So the final equation is this. It turns out
this equation does not get modified anymore, because it describes the time
dependent case and that's the end. So there's going to be only one other
modification. If <i>dB/dt</i> has messed up <i>E</i>, then <i>dE</i>/<i>dt</i>
was going to mess up <i>B</i>. You'd sort of expect that. That's the last
part. But I will spend a little bit of time on this, and then we'll turn to
that. Okay.</p>
