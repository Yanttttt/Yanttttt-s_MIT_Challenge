<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b> Okay, so I'm going to begin with something I did last time, because it was not
completed, then we'll take it from there. And we had a lot more questions last
time, which is good, very helpful, so I know what may be bothering you. So
don't hesitate to stop me. The new thing we did last time was, if I give you
some wave function, &#968;<i>(x)</i>, and I ask you what happens if I measured
energy, the recipe is the same as in momentum. You've got to find functions
called &#968;<sub>E</sub><i>(x)</i>, which are supposed to be states in which, if
the electron was there, it'll have a definite energy. Now, not worrying for a
moment on how you get them, the recipe for what happens when you measure energy
is that if you're given some arbitrary function &#968;, that's a state the particle
is in. And you're asking, &quot;What happens if I measure energy? What will I
get?&quot; The instruction is to write that function as a sum over these
functions, each associated with a definite energy. And once you have done
that, the probability that you will get a certain energy <i>E</i> = the
absolute value squared of that particular coefficient. Not different from &#968;<sub>p</sub> , same rule. And the rule for <i>A<sub>E</sub></i> is also the same, or
similar. <i>A<sub>E</sub></i> is the integral of complex conjugate of this
function associated with definite energy, times the function you're thinking
about, integrated over space. It's the same rule. So it can happen, the
problem can take many forms. Sometimes one can give you a function &#968;<i>(x)</i>.
Then you take all these functions, do all these integrals, find all the
coefficients and you square them. Other times the coefficients may be given to
you; you're just asked, &quot;What's the odd for this energy or that
energy?&quot; </p>
<p>But now the question
is, what are these functions, &#968;<sub>E</sub><i>(x)</i>. Whereas functions of
definite momentum are given once and for all by this formula, <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>,
I wish I could give you a function of definite energy and say, &quot;These are
functions of definite energy. Maybe instead of <i>p</i>, there'll be some <i>E</i>
on the top.&quot; No, it's not like that. You've got to do a lot more work,
because the reason is that the functions of definite energy depend on what the
energy is in classical mechanics. And in classical mechanics, the energy
depends on the momentum and on the potential energy. That means on the
position. Every problem has a different formula for <i>E</i>. If it's a
harmonic oscillator, this will be &frac12;<i>kx<sup>2</sup></i>. If it's a particle
moving up and down in gravity, it could be <i>mgy</i>. If it's two particles
connected by a spring, it will be something else. So in each problem, our
electron in Hydrogen atom, is the coulomb force, coulomb potential, <i>e<sub>1</sub>e<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>r<sup>2</sup></i>
times some 4&Pi;'s. So in each problem, there's a different <i>V</i> and for each
<i>V</i>, you've got to find the <i>E</i>--I mean, you've got to find the
functions. </p>
<p>And what is the
rule? The rule is the following. You have to solve the following equation,
called the Schr&#246;dinger equation, <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup> </i>+ <i>V(x)&#968;(x)
</i>= <i>E</i> times--you just have to solve this equation. So let's not worry
about how you solve it. That's a problem in mathematics, but the point is
that, given a potential <i>V</i>, you come to this equation, and you go to the
math department and say, &quot;Give me all the solutions of this
equation.&quot; And they'll give you all the solutions of the equation. They
will find, in fact, only for certain special values of <i>E</i> that the
equation has acceptable solutions. And for each one, they'll give you the
solution and you start with that solution and do all of this. You follow
that? That's the program. </p>
<p>So I did a very
simple example last time, which was two examples. First I said, take the
problem with no potential, no force, particle is free of all forces. Then the
equation is very simple, -<i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>/2m d<sup>2</sup>&#968;</i>--I'm sorry, <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup></i>.
There is no <i>V&#968;</i>. That is just <i>E&#968;</i>. So let's rearrange this to the
following form: <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup> </i>+<i> k<sup>2</sup>&#968;</i> =
0, where <i>k<sup>2</sup></i> is just 2<i>mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>. </p>
<p>You know if you
multiply by 2<i>m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>, you'll get this equation. Since this
combination appears all the time, I want to give it a name, <i>k<sup>2</sup></i>.
But you must understand, what's the relation of <i>k</i> to anything else you
know will be clear in a minute. So what's the solution to this one? You can
write them in terms of sines and cosines, but I want to write them in terms of
exponentials and the solution was--there are two solutions. One is <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i>,
where <i>k </i>is defined that way. Other is <i>e<sup>-ikx</sup></i>. You can
check. If you took this function and take two derivatives of either this term
of that term, both will give you &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup></i> times the function
itself. Every time you take a derivative, you bring down an <i>ik</i> or a -<i>ik</i>.
If you do it twice, it's &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>. And <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are
arbitrary right now. There is no restriction coming from that equation. And
what is <i>k</i>? You know that functions of definite momentum look like <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>,
and I have something that says <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i>. It's very clear that <i>p</i>
is just <i>&#8463;k</i>, or <i>k</i> is <i>p/&#8463;</i>. So if you like, this equation I
got, we can write as <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup></i> is 2<i>mE</i>. That
means <i>p<sup>2</sup></i> is 2<i>mE</i>. That means <i>E</i> = <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>.
So let's understand what that means. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Just jumping back
for a second. At the bottom of the top board, you wrote the <i>E</i> for
classical mechanics. Did the equation to the right of that come from that?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
In a way, it does. That's correct. I will tell you how it does. But right
now, I'm just giving you a recipe. If in classical mechanics, you know what
the kinetic and potential energy of the particle are. Kinetic is always <i>p<sup>2</sup>/</i>2<i>m</i>.
Potential is <i>V(x) </i>where <i>V</i> depends on the context. Then in the
quantum theory, the functions of definite energy obey an equation which looks a
lot like that in many ways, right? So I've given you some clues or some more
discretion in my notes on what is the universal recipe for guessing the
equation in every context. I'll talk about it a little bit. But right now,
you can take the view that this guy just tells me that if you want states of
definite energy, solve that equation. Look, so what is this saying? Think
about this. It's saying, if you want a state of definite energy, it is really
made up of states of definite momentum, and the momenta that appear here are
not arbitrary. They are simply the momenta that you will have, even in
classical mechanics, for that definite energy, because if <i>E</i> is <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>,
<i>p</i> would be ±&#8730;2<i>mE</i>. That's exactly what we have. If <i>k</i> =
here,&#8230; this says <i>k</i> = &#8730;2<i>mE</i>/<i>&#8463;</i>, and <i>&#8463;k </i>is just &#8730;2<i>mE</i>.
So that looks like classical mechanics, right? </p>
<p>Even before you took
the course, if I said there's a particle on a ring. Its energy is <i>E</i>,
what is its momentum? You will say since energy is <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>, <i>p</i>
must be ±&#8730;2<i>mE</i> and they mean going one way, and going the other way.
These are the only two options. That part is very much like classical
mechanics. The <i>k</i> is related to <i>E</i> exactly the way it would be.
What is novel here is that this state, simultaneously can yield either the
clockwise momentum or the counterclockwise momentum. That's the sense in which
it's a different thing, you understand? A classical particle of energy <i>E</i>
will have one of these two momenta, but on any given day, on any given trial,
it will have only one of these two. It cannot have both the signs. Either
it's going like this or going like that. In quantum theory, it's in the state
of limbo. Not this alone, not that alone, both. </p>
<p>The probability of
going clockwise is proportional to <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>, and the probability of
going counterclockwise is proportional to <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>. If you want,
you can put the square root of <i>L</i>&#39;s and so on, but they're all common to
everything, so the relative probability is just in the ratio of <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>
is to <i>B<sup>2</sup></i>. It's an admixture. And there is no restriction on
how much of <i>A</i> and how much of <i>B</i> you should put into your answer.
You can pick the extreme case where only <i>A</i> is non-zero. That's fine.
That's a particle who has a definite energy and a definite momentum. You can
pick this one, a definite energy in the opposite momentum, but in general, both
can be non-zero. It's a state of definite energy whose momentum is known in
magnitude but not in sign, because both allowed signs appear here. </p>
<p>The other result from
quantum mechanics, which is surprising, is whereas a particle in a ring can
have any momentum, in quantum theory, the demand that when you go around the
ring, if you add an <i>L</i> to the <i>x</i>, you should come back to the same
function, makes the requirement that <i>kL</i> is some multiple of 2&Pi;.That
means <i>k</i> = 2&Pi;<i>n/L</i>, or <i>p</i> is 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i> times <i>n</i>. The
allowed values of <i>k</i> or <i>p</i> are restricted in this way, and the
allowed values of energy then, which is <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>, are restricted
to be <i>4&Pi;<sup>2</sup>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i> over 2<i>m</i> <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>
times an integer <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>. And this is a problem where energy is
quantized. It's really quantized because momentum is quantized and the energy
in this simple example is simply <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>. That means if you
shine light on the system, it will absorb light only at certain frequencies,
and it will emit light only at certain frequencies. And what are those
frequencies? Well, all of this there's a bunch of numbers. <i>&#8463;, m, L</i>
they're not changing. <i>n</i> can be 0 + or - 1, + or - 2 etc. For every <i>n
</i>you put in, you'll get this basic number times 0 squared or 1 squared or 2
squared. So you will find that will be the state <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>, which
is<i> n</i>=0. Then above that, the energy of that will be <i>2&Pi;<sup>2</sup>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>
over <i>mL</i> squared. Then there'll be <i>n</i>=1, and there'll be <i>n</i>=-1.
Both will have the same energy, because energy depends only on <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>.
The energy of that will be--I'm sorry. I made a mistake. <i>E<sub>0</sub> </i>is
simply 0, because that corresponds to <i>n</i>=0. <i>E<sub>1</sub> </i>will be
what I wrote here, with <i>n</i>=1, which will be <i>2&Pi;<sup>2</sup>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>
over <i>mL </i>squared. </p>
<p>So what I'm saying
is, at a given energy, you can have a state of right moving clockwise or
anticlockwise momentum, or a crazy mixture of the two. But normally, if you
wish, you may select from these mixtures, two special cases, one which is all <i>A</i>
and one which is all <i>B</i>. We like those because now we can visualize them
as states having a definite momentum clockwise, a definite momentum
counterclockwise. That's what one really means by drawing two lines at that energy.
So if you absorb a photon, you've got to give an energy equal to the difference
of these two numbers, which is that. And that will be the <i>&#8463;&#969;</i> of your
photon. And if you emit a photon and come from there down here, that photon
frequency will be given by that. So this is how a quantum system is usually
probed. We cannot actually look in and see anything. We deal with it by
shining light and we see what light it absorbs, what light it emits. The
frequency of light is a clue as to energy level differences, you understand?
Not to the energy themselves, but to the energy level difference that turns
into photon energy. But you can put together the levels by putting together
all the differences, so you measure all the differences. </p>
<p>So one famous line is
the hydrogen 21 centimeter line. Hydrogen atom has two levels which are close,
and the wavelength of that is 21 centimeters. There's a standard fingerprint
of hydrogen anywhere in the universe. Sometimes, if the wavelength is not 21
but 22, you can say, &quot;Why is it 22? The wavelength is longer. Maybe it's
not hydrogen. Maybe it's somebody else.&quot; But the answer is that it is
hydrogen, but that galaxy is moving away from you, so that its light is Doppler
shifted into the red. If something was coming towards you, it would be blue
shifted. So you can tell, if you believe that hydrogen atoms all over the
universe are the same hydrogen atoms, and the frequency shift is only due to
the motion of the galaxy, you find two things. First, what is it made of and
secondly, what's the speed of the galaxy? So the red shift is what one uses to
find the whole story about galaxies. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> In the context of
a photon, or an atom being ___________ by a photon, what does the L correspond
to?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
What is <i>L</i> for an atom, right? That's your question. Now, this is a
fake atom. This fake atom is an electron moving on a ring, correct? That <i>L</i>
is actually the size of that ring. You can go to a lab and you can make a ring
of certain micron, then the mass of the electron is known. That <i>L</i> would
be the length of the ring. For an atom, what you have to do is that you must
solve it, solve this equation, where <i>V(x)</i> = what? In three dimensions,
it will be the charge of the nucleus, which is <i>Z</i> times e, charge of the
electron, and it's attractive 4<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub>r</i>, which is the separation
between them. So you'll have to solve a similar equation, but that equation
will have <i>d/dx </i>and <i>d/dy</i> and <i>d/dz </i>and so on, right? It's
in three dimensions. But this <i>V(r) </i>will determine the allowed functions
in that problem. That won't be an <i>L</i>, but a certain size will emerge
even from that problem. That size will be the size of the orbit. For example,
if you look at the function, the lowest energy state will look like <i>e</i> to
the -<i>r/a<sub>0</sub> </i>times some number, where <i>a<sub>0</sub></i> is
called the Bohr radius. That will be roughly 10<sup>-8</sup> centimeters.
That <i>a<sub>0</sub></i> will be a length--you can say where is the length and
the height of an atom, right? It's no box. The length is the length made out
of <i>e&#8463;m</i>. You can make a length out of those things. That's what will
come out. So if you want, you can take any textbook that gives you the formula
for hydrogen's Bohr radius, that's supposedly the radius of the orbit, and you
will find its length <i>a<sub>0</sub></i> made out of the parameters in the
problem, which is the charge of the nucleus, the charge of the electron, the
mass of the electron. Okay, so this is, if you want, a simple atom that we
have manufactured, because we can see quantization of energy. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> When you go to the
potential of 0, is it possible to measure both momentum and position, in that
if you measure the energy and a position, don&#39;t you know something about the
momentum?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
But you cannot measure energy and position at the same time either, because
energy--what you can really measure at the same time is energy and momentum.
If you can measure <i>p</i>, you can measure <i>p<sup>2</sup></i>, or <i>p<sup>3</sup></i>
or any function of <i>p</i>. Because knowing a state of well defined momentum,
in this problem, doesn't do anything to the energy, because once you know that
momentum is <i>p</i>, <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m </i>is the energy. So it turns out,
this is a fortunate case where the two variables, energy and momentum, are
simply related to each other in the fact that one is essentially the square of
the other. But if you have two variables, one involving <i>x</i> and <i>p</i>,
at the same time, then you cannot measure them simultaneously with either <i>x</i>
or with <i>p</i>. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What is <i>a<sub>0</sub></i>
again?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
<i>a<sub>0</sub></i>. Gee, I don&#39;t know. The Bohr radius. I think it's <i>&#8463;</i>
squared over me squared, but you have to check. I don&#39;t guarantee that answer,
but I think it's something like that. You can see if it's got at least units
of length. I'm too lazy to try that. I think it's something like this.
Anyway, suppose it is something like this. My main point is, it is a length
made out of Planck's constant, the mass of the electron and the electric
charge. Together they make a length, and that's the length that controls the
size of the orbit. </p>
<p>All right, so this
was the simpler problem. Now I want to take a more complicated problem of what
I call a particle in a box. So that is a potential. See, normally, if you
make a hole in the ground, it may take this shape, and this is the location and
this is the height, but the height is just the potential energy directly,
because it's mg times the height. So imagine a particle somewhere here. In
classical mechanics--by the way, the rule for doing quantum mechanics is, in
classical theory, what's the potential experienced by the particle? That's
what you ask. And it is that potential that enters this crazy Schr&#246;dinger
equation. </p>
<p>So you need to know
classical mechanics before you can do quantum mechanics. You should know what
potential the particle experiences in classical theory, and stick that into
this equation to find the allowed energies in quantum theory. So if it's a
vibrating system, there is some omega for vibrations. That &#969; is &#8730;<i>k/m</i>,
and you can get <i>k</i> from that one. Or if it's a system like an atom,
where there's an electric charge between them, electric force between them, you
should know the electric potential. So you should know the potential in
classical mechanics, and then you do the quantum theory from there. So imagine
a particle in this potential in classical theory, and you ask yourself, what
does it do in quantum theory? Well, classical theory says, let's plot the
energy of the particle, right? It's some number that's not supposed to change
as the particle moves. That means here, if the energy is kinetic + potential,
here the potential is 0, it's all kinetic. But as you start going near the
edge, there are two parts here. That's the potential and that's the kinetic.
And right here, all the energy is potential, and <i>E</i> = potential. There
is no <i>K.</i> What does that mean? </p>
<p>That means the
particle comes here, slows down, comes to a rest, then goes back. It can never
be found here if it had this energy, because it's got more--let's see. It's
got more potential energy than total energy. That means it's got negative
kinetic energy. That's not possible. So every classical particle will execute
bounded oscillations at any energy, between what are called the turning
points. The left turning point and the right turning point is as far as you
can go at that energy. If you've got more energy, of course you can go further
out, and if you've got even more energy, you can just roll up to the top of the
hill and escape. That's classical mechanics. </p>
<p>Now we want to ask
ourselves, in quantum mechanics, what does the particle do? That's our goal.
So I'm going to take a following simpler problem, because it's mathematically
easier. I'm going to take a potential that looks like this. It is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
to the right of<i> L</i>. It's <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> to the left of the origin,
and it is 0 here. It's got very sharp walls, because that makes it easy to
solve the equation. In real life, potentials are rounded off. My fake
potential has got sharp corners. I want to take a particle of some energy and
ask, what are the allowed energies in this problem? </p>
<p>What do the
corresponding functions look like? That's what we're asking. So the rule is
to go back to that equation, which now takes the following form: <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup></i>.
I'm going to stop writing the subscript <i>e</i>. From now on, you should
understand, I'm trying to find states of definite energy <i>E</i>. 2<i>m</i>
times <i>E - V &#968; </i>= 0. I've just rearranged the Schr&#246;dinger equation, so
that it looks like second derivative + all kinds of stuff. So how do we solve
this problem? Well, <i>V</i> varies with position, so there are three regions
in the problem. There's region I inside the well. Inside this well, V is 0.
Outside this well in region II, it = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, some constant.
Likewise in region III to the right of the well, it's also <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.
So we've got to solve this equation in 3 different regions, middle, left and
right. First let's solve it in the middle because it's very easy. What is the
middle defined as? Middle, region I, <i>V</i> = 0. So the equation is <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup>
+ 2mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> </i>is 0. So let me write it as <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup>
+ k<sup>2</sup>&#968; </i>= 0. Just like before. This <i>k</i> is the same as
before, <i>k = &#8730;2mE/&#8463;</i>, in region I. So what's the answer to that one?
Again, it's exponentials, but I'm purposely going to write it in region 1 as
follows: as <i>A</i>cos<i>kx </i>+ <i>B</i>sin<i>kx</i>. I hope you all know
that this has exponentials, our old friends the trigonometric functions, are
also the solution to this equation, because the second derivative of cosine is
roughly - the cosine. The second derivative of sine will also give you &#8722;<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>
times the sine. </p>
<p>So rather than using
exponentials, I'm going to use sine and cosine, because I have an ultimate
motive. You realize that exponentials and sines and cosines are all connected
by Euler's great formula, so if I want, I can take <i>e<sup>ikx</sup> </i>and
write it as cos + <i>i </i>sine. <i>e<sup>-ikx</sup></i>, write that as cos - <i>i</i>
sine. Combine the cosines, and call the coefficient <i>A</i>. Combine the
coefficients for sine and call it <i>B</i>, and get this form. There are two
alternative ways. You just write this, you will see why I picked that. That's
the answer in region I. We're all set. Right now, <i>A</i> is arbitrary, <i>B</i>
is arbitrary and <i>k</i> is arbitrary. There is no restriction at all on any
of them. Do you understand that? Because if you take this function, it satisfies
that equation absolutely. So the free parameters are <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>k</i>,
are all arbitrary. That means it can have any <i>k</i>. But the energy is <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>,
so it can have any energy. But we're not done yet, because we only looked at
region I. Have to look at region II and region III, and then you will find out
what happens. So let's go to region II So in region II, the equation obeyed
by the &#968;, is &#968; (let me call it region II) over <i>dx</i> squared = -<i>2m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>
times <i>V<sub>0</sub> - E</i> &#968;. I just put it on the other side now. Now
this is all a constant. </p>
<p>That's why we picked
the potential, which is piecewise constant, so it's some constant. You're
asking yourself, what &#968; has the property that when I take 2 derivatives, it
looks like this number times &#968;? So let me call this whole combination kappa
squared. Then the answer is &#968; of 2 = <i>C</i> times <i>e<sup>&#954;x</sup></i> + <i>D</i>
times <i>e<sup>-&#954;x</sup></i>. Why? Because two derivatives of this guy will
give me kappa squared times itself; likewise here. And kappa has been cooked
up so that kappa squared is what I want. </p>
<p>Yes, now so &#954; = <i>2m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup>
</i>times <i>V<sub>0</sub> - E </i>under root. So these are now real
exponentials and not imaginary exponentials. The reason that used to be sines
and cosines, or imaginary exponentials, is that inside the well, <i>E - V </i>is
a positive number. Outside the well, I'm assuming that <i>E - V </i>is a
negative number. In other words, I'm going to consider the well to be, in the
end, infinitely deep. And the energy of the particle, whatever it is, is some
finite number. I want to send the walls to infinity. That's called particle
in a box. So I'm taking <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> finite but very, very large.
Then it's very clear that <i>V<sub>0</sub> - E </i>is a positive number. This
kappa is what I have here. Now look at these two functions. This function
grows exponentially as you go to the right, to + infinity. That means the wave
function describes a particle that would rather be at infinity than anywhere
near this well. So it's not the problem we're describing where the particle we
expect is somewhere near the well. Furthermore, the square of &#968; can never be
normalized to 1, because an exponentially growing function, the area under that
is exponentially large. There's no way to fix that. So on physical grounds,
we drop the solution, because we don't have to pick <i>C</i> to be non-zero.
We have the freedom, and the physical condition tells you, no one wants a
function growing at infinity. We want functions falling at infinity. This is
the only function that falls at infinity. And how does it fall at infinity,
how does it fall off? It looks like <i>e </i>to the -&#8730;<i>2m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> </i>times
<i>V<sub>0</sub>(x)</i>. I'm ignoring e compared to this very large <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.
I'm taking <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> much, much bigger than any energy I'm looking
at. So it's falling exponentially, and the number on top is like square root
of <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>. So what do you think happens if <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
becomes very, very large? Well, if you plot the function that's exponentially
falling, it falls like that. But as you increase <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, it
falls more and more quickly. You follow that? </p>
<p>And eventually, even <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
goes to infinity; it just doesn't have a life outside. It just vanishes
immediately. Whatever you start with goes to 0 immediately. That basically
means &#968;<sub>II</sub><i>(x) </i>is just 0 in region III, if <i>V<sub>0</sub> </i>goes
to infinity. So let me emphasize what we are doing here. We have a particle
in some kind of well, which is very, very tall, not yet infinite, and you give
it some energy <i>E</i> that cannot change. In this region, in classical
mechanics, that would be the entire kinetic energy, because potential energy is
0. What about here? This is the total energy available to you. Potential
energy is all of that, so kinetic energy has to be minus some number. That can
never be. That means that particle will never be found in the region outside
this well. Do you understand? As long as the energy is less than it takes to
go to the top of the barrier and climb out, a classical particle--imagine
rounding it off. You can come rolling with any energy. If you don't have
enough energy to go over the top, you cannot be found in this region. </p>
<p>But in quantum
theory, as long as the well is not infinitely large, there's an exponentially
small decaying wave function. So a classical particle will turn around at the
classical turning points. A quantum particle will go slightly outside the
forbidden region, into the forbidden region in both directions of the well.
That is a purely quantum phenomenon. It is forbidden, meaning it's discouraged
from going there, but it's not absolutely forbidden. That's called going over
the--well, it's going into the classical forbidden region, but as the barrier
gets higher and higher, the excursion into the forbidden region becomes less
and less, because the function falls very rapidly. And I'm considering, for
simplicity, a barrier which is infinitely tall, in which case it doesn't go
there at all, even in quantum theory. Therefore, by a similar argument, &#968; is 0
here and &#968; is 0 here, and in region I, I've shown you, &#968;
= <i>A</i>cos<i>kx</i> + <i>B</i>sin<i>kx</i>, where the energy is related to <i>k</i>
by <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>. </p>
<p>So first when we did
only region I, you get the impression that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>
and <i>k</i> can be whatever you like. But now we have an extra restriction.
The restriction is that if you draw the function in this well, it can do
whatever it wants, but it must vanish at the two ends, because it's 0 here and
it's 0 here. Just by continuity of &#968;, every &#968; that's allowed must vanish at
the two ends. That's a new restriction, because the function that I have here
in general will not vanish at the two ends, but I'm going to demand that it
vanish. That will tell me something about the allowed values of <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>
and <i>k</i>. You will see what it is. First I demand that &#968; should vanish on
the left end of the wall, which is the wall at <i>x</i> = 0. This is the wall
at <i>x = L</i>. &#968; of 0 should be 0. I take the function I have. When this
is 0, <i>x</i> is 0, that guy is gone. I get <i>A</i> times cosine 0 which is
just <i>A</i>. But that has to vanish. That means the coefficient <i>A</i>
has to vanish. It is not allowed. So even though it looked like, before we
went to the other regions, you can have any <i>A</i> and any <i>B</i>. If
you're only in the middle region, that's correct. But if you want to connect
your answer in the middle region to a 0 on either side, then the coefficient
has to be such that the &#968; you have in the middle vanishes at the left end. So <i>A</i>
is gone. </p>
<p>So I'm now left with
only the following thing: &#968;<i>(x)</i> = <i>B</i>sin<i>kx</i>. We did not have
to kill <i>B</i> because that <i>x</i> = 0 sine vanished, so it is allowed.
But now I demand furthermore it should vanish at <i>x = L</i>. Well, at <i>x =
L</i>, what do I find? I want 0 to = <i>B</i>sin<i>kL</i>. That should be 0.
Now one simple way to get there is to kill <i>B,</i> say<i> B</i> = 0, but then
you've got no solution. You killed <i>A</i> and you killed <i>B</i>. It's
certainly true that &#968; = 0 is the solution to this equation, but it doesn't
describe anything. So you don't want to kill <i>B</i>, so you want to blame
the 0 on the sine, and the sine, as you know, vanishes for any multiple of &Pi;.
You can have 0 times &Pi;, 2&Pi;, 3&Pi;, 4&Pi;, -6&Pi;. They all give you 0 for sine. Therefore
k is quantized to be one of these numbers. Therefore k has got only values <i>n&Pi;/L</i>.
I'm going to call it <i>k<sub>n</sub></i>. And the energy, which is really <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>/2m
L</i> squared--sorry, <i>k<sup>2</sup>/2m,</i> becomes now <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>&Pi;<sup>2</sup>/2m
L<sup>2</sup></i> times <i>n<sup>2</sup>.</i> And &#968; looks like <i>B</i>--&#968;'s
of <i>n</i> looks like <i>B</i>sin<i>(n&Pi;x/L).</i> You guys see that? </p>
<p>These are the allowed
function. The sine function is very nice. It vanishes on the left end,
because when <i>x</i> is 0, it's gone. When <i>x=L</i>, the argument of the
sine is a multiple of &Pi;, it vanishes. So it looks like this when<i> n</i> = 1.
It looks like that when <i>n</i>=2, and so on. So it's got more and more
wiggles in the region in between, but they are designed so that they vanish
precisely at the edges. So it's like it's exactly the case of a violin string
that's clamped to two ends, which has to vanish at the two ends, because you
don't let it move there. In between, it can do this and it can do that. It
can have more and more wiggles. So what you find is, of the three things that
we thought were arbitrary, <i>A</i> is gone, and <i>k</i> is not arbitrary. <i>k
</i>is again quantized to be <i>n&Pi;/L</i>, so that the function does <i>n</i>
half oscillations between one end and the other end. And therefore there's a
corresponding quantization of energy. Yes? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> What does that
tell you? If you square &#968;<sub>n</sub>, does that give the probability of
finding it in each one, the energy levels?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. Let's talk about that now. So let's write down the function. The &#968; sub energy
that we were looking for, we have finally found out, so let's have a picture in
our mind. Here is the well. It's going all the way to infinity. There is the
state <i>n</i>=1, and the function looks like this. Then there is the
state--let me draw it right there, it looks like that, <i>n</i>=2 and so on.
In the &#968;<sub>n</sub> (let me label the energy by <i>n</i>) equals some constant
<i>B</i> times sin<i>(n&Pi;x/L)</i>. That means if you want a particle in the
well to have a definite energy, the wave function must look like one of these
sine functions. It must look like this or it must look like that, or the
higher harmonics. They are the only allowed functions for states of definite
energy. Now before I answer any further questions, the allowed values of <i>n</i>
here you might think are 0, + or - 1, + or - 2 etc., but I claim they're just
1, 2, 3 and so on. You should think about why. What's wrong with <i>n</i>=0?
Is that a possible value? Can anybody tells me what happens to this function
if--yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It identically
vanishes</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
If <i>n</i>=0, the function identically vanishes, right? Because sine of 0
times <i>&Pi;x/L </i>is identical. That's not what you want. You want a
nontrivial solution. So we drop this guy. But how about <i>n</i>=-1? Why
don't I keep that? Yes? Oh, I thought I imagined a hand going up. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's the same
thing as -<i>B</i> sine of the positive value.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct. If you put <i>n</i>=-1, the function &#968; of -1 is <i>B</i> sin<i>(-&Pi;x/L)</i>,
but that = -1 times <i>B</i> sin<i>(&Pi;x/L)</i>. This guy is just &#968;<sub>1</sub>.
So it's just a multiple of the &#968;<sub>1</sub> function, because -1 times the
state is the same state. You don&#39;t get a new function; you just get a multiple
of the old function, and in quantum mechanics, they're all the same. But be
very careful. When I did a particle on a ring, I did <i>e<sup>ipx/&#8463;</sup></i>,
where I said <i>p</i> = 2&Pi;<i>&#8463;/L</i> times any integer <i>n</i>. There I let n
= 0, + - 1, + - 2 etc. Why did I allow that? First of all, in that case, e to
the i times 0 is not 0. It's in fact constant. So for a particle going in a
ring, the 0 momentum state is actually allowed. And +1 and -1 are not the
same, because <i>e<sup>ipx</sup></i> and <i>e<sup>-ipx</sup></i>, forget the &#8463;,
they are not proportional to each other. You understand that? You can never
write <i>e<sup>ipx</sup></i> as a multiple of <i>e<sup>-ipx</sup></i>. You see
that? If there were such a multiple, let me call the multiple as <i>N</i>,
then <i>N</i> is really <i>e<sup>2ipx</sup></i> by bringing it the other side.
That's certainly not a constant. So <i>e<sup>ipx</sup></i> can never be
converted to <i>e<sup>-ipx</sup> </i>by multiplying by any number, so it's an
independent solution. On the other hand, sin<i>x</i> and sin<i>(-x)</i> are
related to each other by a single factor of -1. </p>
<p>So that's the reason
why in that case of a particle going in a ring, the solutions are labeled by
all integers, positive, negative and 0, but a particle in a box, we label only
by positive integers. Negative integers give you the same function and 0 kills
the function, so that's not allowed. Okay, so what about <i>B</i>? What shall
I do with <i>B</i>? What equation's going to determine <i>B</i>? Yes, any
idea? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Normalize right?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Right. So first of all, the equation will never tell you what <i>B</i> is.
That's what I want you to understand. The equation that I've written here for
the energy functions on the top, if size of <i>B</i> is a solution, you can
multiply both sides by any number, like 15. Then 15 times &#968; will also be a
solution. That's a property of a linear equation that the answer is not given
in overall scale. Give me one answer; I rescale it, it's still an answer. So
linear equation will never tell me the overall size of the function. That is
picked by the extra convenient restriction that &#968;<sup>2</sup><i>dx</i> = 1.
That will determine <i>B</i> and I'm claiming the answer is the &#8730;(2/<i>L</i>)
is what you want <i>B</i> to be. The answer is again simple. The average
value of sine squared over 1 half period is 1 half. If you square or integrate
or whatever, you'll get <i>L</i>/2, so <i>B<sup>2</sup> </i>times <i>L</i>/2
should be 1, and <i>B</i> should therefore be the &#8730;(2/<i>L</i>). So let me
write down now the final result of this problem, which I think is very, very
instructive. If you can follow this much, you've really got 80 percent of the
quantum mechanics I want to teach you. If you're comfortable with this
example, because we're trying to find out, in quantum theory, you've got a
particle in a box, which is like a hole in the floor, which is so deep that
it's infinitely deep. But even if it's not infinite but very deep, the
answer's good enough. You want to know what it will do. In classical
mechanics, what will it do? If you&#39;re a particle in a box, what's your lowest
energy state? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Floor of the box.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
If you're in prison with infinitely tall walls, you just sit on the floor and
mope, right? That's the lowest energy state. But that's not allowed in
quantum mechanics, because you have a definite<i> x</i>, which is wherever
you're sitting, a definite <i>p</i>, you're not moving. Such a state is not
allowed. So in quantum mechanics, a particle cannot simply sit still.
Therefore, it will necessarily have an uncertainty in position, and it will try
to spread itself over the box. And the typical uncertainty is of order. If I
say, &quot;Where is this particle?&quot; I don't know anything. It's got to be
somewhere in the box. That's the estimate for <i>&#916;x</i>. So <i>&#916;p</i> has got
to be bigger than <i>&#8463;/L</i>. Forget all the 2&Pi;'s. So it cannot have 0
momentum. It's momentum has to be fluctuating with that range. And the
kinetic energy, which is in fact the total energy inside the box, which is <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>,
the size of that is <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>/2m L<sup>2</sup></i>. So that is your
estimate for what should be the energy of a particle in a box of size <i>L.</i>
So what happens is, the box of size <i>L</i> forces it to have a spread in
momentum, because you've squeezed it to a position known to within <i>L</i>.
The spread in momentum translates into spread in kinetic energy, and if I take
the spread in kinetic energy to be a rough estimate of the lowest kinetic
energy I could have, you get a number which except for factors of &Pi; is in fact
the right answer. </p>
<p>So people always
estimate energies of particles by doing this calculation. For example, take a
nucleus, which is 10<sup>-13</sup> centimeters across. I put a proton there.
What's the minimum kinetic energy of that proton? You find by the following
method: <i>&#916;x </i>is 10<sup>-13</sup>, because it's somewhere in the nucleus. <i>&#916;p
</i>is that, and you do that, you will get some energy. That will be the
typical energy of a particle inside the nucleus. So particles inside the
nucleus cannot sit still. More you cram them, it's like children. You put them
in a tighter room, they're jiggling more and more. That's called zero point
motion. You cannot just nail them in <i>x</i> without letting them spread in <i>p</i>.
That means you cannot get the lowest energy So lowest energy is some
number you can estimate by the uncertainty principle. </p>
<p>So the next question
was, let's take one of these functions, say &#968;'s of 3, the square root of (2/<i>L</i>)sin(3&Pi;<i>x/L</i>).
If you plot that guy, that function will look like this. Now what was your
question? If I measure a particle's position, what's the probability? You've
just got to square this function. It will look like this. That's the
probability. If you measure the energy, what will you get? You will get
exactly one energy corresponding to <i>n</i>=3. It's in a state of definite
energy, but not definite position. Position has got some ups and downs. The
probability for x looks like that. So everyone with me? This is like knowing
the spectrum of this artificial atom. In a real atom, the electron is forced
to stay near the nucleus, because the 1 over <i>r</i> potential, if you plot it
as a function of <i>r</i>, looks like a well. And the particle is somewhere
here. In this problem, the particle is confined by the box. Whenever you have
a confining thing that keeps the particle in a certain region, the energy gets
quantized. And we found out in our first example the quantized energy levels
of a particle in a box. And you can probe the particle by shining light and
the energy levels are plotted like this. This is <i>n</i>=1, this is <i>n</i>=2,
which is <i>n</i>=3. Zero is here. The zero state is not allowed. You've got
to have <i>n</i>=1 and 4 times that will be <i>n</i>=2, and 9 times that will
be <i>n</i>=3. Energy grows like <i>n<sup>2</sup></i>. And then you can come
from there to there emitting a photon, or you can go from there to there
emitting a photon, or you can go from here to here absorbing a photon. You can
do all kinds of things. That's how if you want you can test quantum
mechanics. Put a known particle inside the well and shine light and see what
light it absorbs. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> So the &#968; of 3, is
that the &#968; of the energy function _________?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes. Exactly right. So what I should really write, he's absolutely right, I
should write <i>E</i> = <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup>&Pi;<sup>2</sup>/2m L </i>squared 3
squared, right? The third energy level. So I'm short circuiting all of that
and just calling it &#968;<sub>3</sub>. Normally, if you put a label 3, it's not
clear what we're talking about. Maybe it's the position <i>x</i>=3. Maybe it's
the momentum <i>p</i>=3. But in this lecture, since we're talking only about
energy, I thought I will just call it &#968;<sub>3</sub>, but at least I should call
it &#968;<sub>E3</sub>.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yeah, I just did that.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You can take the complex conjugate, but for a real function, you can just
square it, right? You understand? If &#968; is real, &#968;&#42;is the same as &#968;. So &#968;&#42;is
also (2/<i>L</i>)sin(3<i>&Pi;x/L</i>). So &#968;&#42;&#968; is just a square.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> On the first
board, you have <i>A<sub>E</sub></i> = _________ &#968;&#42;<i>E</i> &#968; _______. I'm
wondering why there's no _______________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. I think I know what the problem is you're having now. That formula is not
relevant now. I'll tell you when that formula will come into play. It will
come into play in the following situation. I have a particle in a box whose
wave function looks like this. Somebody put it in that state, okay? It's an
allowed wave function because it vanishes at the ends like it should. Beyond
that, it does anything it wants. That is my <i>&#968;(x)</i>, okay? If I measure
the energy of that guy, now you tell me, if I measure the energy in that state,
what answer will I get?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Pardon me? Yes. I'll get one of those quantized values, do you understand? A
particle in a box under energy measurement can give only one of those numbers.
Now this guy is not one of those functions, you understand. This is a randomly
chosen function. But when I measure energy, so what will I do? Maybe you can
guess now.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Write it as a sum
of energy functions</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct. You will have to write this guy as a sum of A--let me call it n
for energy now. A &#8730;(2/<i>L</i>) sin<i>(n&Pi;x/L)</i>. I mean, this is just <i>A<sub>E</sub></i>
&#968;'s of <i>E</i> of <i>x</i>. Except E is labeled by an integer, so I'm
writing it this way. Then I have to find A<sub>n</sub>. And if I want to find
<i>A<sub>n</sub></i>, that = integral of (2/<i>L</i>)sin<i>(n&Pi;x/L)</i>. If
you want, you can put a conjugate, but it doesn't matter, because sine is
real. Multiply it by Mr. Crazy here, whatever it is, and do their integral.
It will give you some number for every<i> n</i>. <i>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub></i>, and the square of every one of them will give
you the odds that you will find this energy or that energy or some other
energy. So what quantum mechanics tells you is, an energy measurement of a
particle in a box cannot give a random answer. It can only give one of these
answers. That's the quantization of energy. It does not mean every particle
in a box is in a state of definite energy. A particle in a box can be any wave
function, provided it vanishes at the ends and doesn't spill out of the
infinitely tall wall. </p>
<p>So for every one of
them, you can ask the usual questions: what happens when I measure position?
Square the function. What happens when I measure momentum? Write it in terms
of <i>e</i> to the <i>ipx</i> functions. What happens when I measure energy?
Write it in terms of these functions. </p>
<p>Okay? All right, so
I want to do one last topic here, which is called scattering, but I don't want
to proceed till you guys have understood this part. This is covered in all the
books and maybe you can read the books or you can read my notes. You can talk
to everybody. But we have solved--from this, all quantum problems that we all
do are exactly isomorphic to this problem. It's the same thing we do over and
over again, except the equations you solve are more difficult. They can be in
higher dimensions. They can involve more than one particle. The potential
could be complicated, but the philosophy is always the same. There'll be some
Schr&#246;dinger equation, and you want to find all the functions that satisfy it,
find the allowed energies and the allowed functions. We will see that states
of definite energy have a very privileged role in quantum mechanics. That will
be clear in the next two lectures. </p>
<p>But right now, here's
what I want to do. This is a very small variation of what we have done, so
most of the hard work has been done. I'm just going to cash in on that. Take
the following problem in classical mechanics: here is the level ground. Then I
make a little change in the landscape so that this has got certain height and
therefore certain potential, <i>V<sub>0</sub>.</i> And from this end, I roll a
marble and see what happens. The marble is given some energy <i>E</i>, which
because there is no potential here, it's just <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m</i>.
Question is, what will happen? Can you tell me what will happen in this
problem, to this marble?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Don't we have to
use the Schr&#246;dinger equations?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No. Classical mechanics.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Oh, the marble
will only go up as far as it has the amount of energy that that would equal the
potential energy at that point.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
That's correct. So he said it will go as far as energy equals potential, so
let <i>p<sup>2</sup>/2m </i>have this value. That's my energy. And it does
not change. That's the law of conservation of energy. So here, since energy
is kinetic + potential, it's all kinetic. Somewhere here, that part of it is
potential; the rest of it is kinetic. Here kinetic vanishes. Here you're not
allowed. So you will go, you will climb that far and you'll come back. But if
your initial energy was that, then you will come here, going very fast. You
will slow down, but you still make it on the other side, but with lower
velocity. That's very simple. There's only one answer you can get. You throw
something. If it comes back, it means the barrier is taller than what you
have. Suppose you cannot see this barrier. All you have is a marble, and you
want to know how tall the barrier is. Very easy. Throw the marble at a known
speed. If it comes back, then you haven't reached the top of the barrier.
Keep on increasing the kinetic energy till one day it doesn't come back.
That's when you're sitting right here. That's one way to tell how tall this
hill is without actually going there. But now what I want to do is do a
quantum mechanical experiment in exactly the same situation. </p>
<p>I want to send a particle
from the left and I want to see what happens. So now, to simplify the problem,
I'm going to take the potential to again have only 2 values. At <i>x</i> = 0,
it jumps to a value <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>. So this problem is just the
Schr&#246;dinger equation in the left region, Schr&#246;dinger equation in the right
region. So I'm going to spare you some of the calculations, because it's so
familiar. One will look like <i>Ae<sup>ikx</sup> + Be<sup>-ikx</sup></i>,
where <i>k<sup>2</sup> </i>is just 2<i>mE/&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>, here. First,
let's take a case where <i>E</i> is bigger than <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, okay?
Then I go to region II. Region II I've got to solve the Schr&#246;dinger equation
with a <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> in it. Then you will find in region II, &#968; II looks
like <i>Ce<sup>ik&#39;x</sup></i> + <i>De<sup>&#8722;ik&#39;x</sup></i>, where <i>k&#39;<sup>2</sup></i>
will be <i>2m</i> times <i>E - V<sub>0</sub> </i>over <i>&#8463;<sup>2</sup></i>.
Because when you have a potential, you must always have--look at the
Schr&#246;dinger equation here--<i>2m/&#8463;<sup>2</sup> </i>at <i>E - V</i>. So <i>E</i>
is not 0. The <i>k&#39;</i> now, so what does this mean? You can see very simply,
it's got some momentum here. It's got a smaller momentum here, because <i>k&#39;<sup>2</sup></i>
is going to be smaller than <i>k<sup>2</sup>,</i> because <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
is non-zero here. That is just the statement that when the particle's moving
here, it's slower than when it's here, because it has to climb up the hill. </p>
<p>So the wave functions
in this region has got an incoming, right moving wave of momentum, <i>&#8463;k</i>.
It's got to reflect that wave of momentum -<i>&#8463;k</i>. And in this region
again, it's got a right moving and a left moving, because this <i>k</i> can be
of either sign. So you can pick the coefficients, <i>A, B, C, D </i>arbitrarily,
but I'm going to choose <i>D</i> = 0, because what I have in mind is a problem
where the particle actually came in from the left. If it came in from the
left, I'm prepared for some of it coming back reflected, and some of it getting
transmitted. There's nobody coming in from the right at + infinity, because
I'm not sending anything from there. I'm sending my particle from the left.
So I pick a solution in which <i>D</i>, which is anything, I pick that to be
0. So here are my two solutions. I hope you understand that <i>k</i> and <i>k&#39;</i>
are not the same number. <i>k'</i> is smaller because the momentum on the
right hand side is going to be less, because some of it's eaten up by potential
energy. So what people do is they draw a picture like this. They draw a wave
that's going at some speed, and it comes in this region and it slows down.
That's what the function will look like. </p>
<p>The real function's
made of exponentials, but the real and imaginary parts will have rapid
oscillations on the left and slow oscillations on the right, because <i>k</i>
is bigger than <i>k&#39;</i>. Very good. So now I have the following condition:
at the interface where the two regions meet, the &#968; must match from the left and
from the right. So <i>x</i> = 0, coming from the left, I want &#968;<sub>1</sub> at
0 should be the same at &#968;<sub>2</sub> at 0. That will tell me that <i>A + B = C</i>.
Because if you put <i>x</i> = 0, all the exponentials become one, and <i>A + B </i>must
= <i>C</i>. There's the condition that if you come from the two sides, the
wave function has to match. But in the Schr&#246;dinger theory, you make a second
requirement that the derivatives also match. The two functions coming from the
left and right cannot join like this. They must join with the same slope. The
reason the slope must be the same is that if the slope changed abruptly at one
point, the rate of change of slope will be infinite there, because <i>d<sup>2</sup>&#968;/dx<sup>2</sup>
</i>is the rate of change of the slope. </p>
<p>But in the
Schr&#246;dinger equation, the second derivative &#968;, if it's infinite, there is no
compensating terms in the equation, because <i>E</i> and <i>V</i> are all
finite. So that infinity will not be balanced, so you can never have that. So
second derivative must be finite; first derivative must be continuous. So I
make the requirement that <i>d&#968;/dx</i> in region I at <i>x </i>= 0 must match <i>d&#968;</i>
II <i>dx</i> at <i>x</i> = 0. What does that give me? Well, take the
derivative and equate them at <i>x</i> = 0, you'll find ik times <i>A - B </i>=
<i>ik&#39;</i> times <i>C</i>. Take the derivative and then equate the derivatives
at <i>x</i> = 0. Derivatives brings down <i>ik</i> for this, -<i>ik </i>for
that. Blah, blah, you put them together. </p>
<p>So these are the two
conditions. Now what causes mild panic is that I have three unknowns and two
equations. I've got <i>A, B </i>and <i>C</i>, and I've got only two
equations. So what do you think is going on? Anybody have an idea? It's that
even in the particle in a box, you'll remember the overall height of the wave
function is never determined by the Schr&#246;dinger equation. It's whatever you
like. So what people do is they say, &quot;Let's pick <i>A</i> = 1.&quot; </p>
<p>That sets the overall
height arbitrarily. Then I get 1 + <i>B = C </i>and <i>ik</i> times 1 - <i>B</i>
= <i>ik&#39; [C}. </i>Now of course you can solve for <i>B</i> and you can solve
for <i>C</i>. I'm not going to do that here; it's very easy. You're going to
find <i>B = k &#8722; k&#39; </i>over <i>k + k&#39;</i>. You're going to find <i>C</i> = 2<i>k</i>
over <i>k + k</i>&#39;. That's simple algebra of simultaneous equations. I want
you to look at the answer. You remember now what <i>A, B</i> and <i>C</i>
are. <i>A</i> comes in, <i>B</i> goes back and <i>C</i> goes to the right.
What do you find strange about the answer? It's that if you came in from the
left with an energy bigger than the barrier, there's a certain probability that
you will go backwards. In classical mechanics, if your energy is more than the
barrier, you will never come back. The probability is 0. In quantum theory,
even though your energy is more than the barrier, there's a certain probability
you'll get reflected and certain probability to get transmitted. The square of
this is like the odds of going to the right. The square of this is like the
odds of getting reflected. </p>
<p>The point is the
reflection probability does not vanish even if the energy is bigger than the
barrier height. That's because this is quantum mechanics and you're really
dealing with waves and not particles. And waves have the property that when
the medium changes, there is some reflection. And to the quantum mechanical
wave &#968;, a barrier looks like a change in refractive index, so it will get
reflected and some will get transmitted. But the interesting thing is, in the
quantum problem, you can send your billiard ball to find how tall the mountain
is. And even if the energy was more than the mountain, sometimes it'll come
back. So that's not a reliable way to measure that. </p>
<p>The last example is,
what if your energy is less than this? What if your energy is like here, lower
than the barrier? If you're lower than the barrier, you will find that <i>k&#39;</i>
will equal <i>i </i>times some &#954;, because it will become imaginary, and you
will have then a function that looks like this. The function will oscillate,
then it will die exponentially in this region. It's exactly what I did
earlier, like particle in a box. </p>
<p>In the classically
forbidden region, it goes a little distance but not very far. So it does get
reflected if the energy is less, but you can actually find it in a region where
it's not supposed to be. And you can say that's going to be very embarrassing
for the particle to be found here, because its kinetic energy should be
negative here. So what's the particle say to you when you catch it there? It
will say, &quot;In order to locate me here, you shine some light on me, and the
energy I got from the photon made me legitimate in that region.&quot; It will
come back to positive energy. So the act of measurement will prevent it from
ever being caught in that region, but it's got an amplitude, a probability to
be caught there. </p>
<p>Final thing I want
to mention is, if this barrier, instead of going on forever, terminated there
and became 0 again, this will leak out here and start going out with the same
wavelength as that one. That's called barrier penetration. That means if you
send a particle here with an energy not enough to overcome the barrier in
classical mechanics, in quantum mechanics, it's got a small chance of being
found on the other side. On the other side, it can go scot free. It's not
allowed in this region, because there the kinetic energy is negative. Here
kinetic energy is the same as before, except the height may be very small. So
this means no barrier is completely safe in quantum theory. </p>
<p>So I'm going to give
you my final survival tip. I've told you so many situations you can be in
where this course will help you. So here's another one. You are in a prison
and it doesn&#39;t have infinite walls, but it's got some walls. What's your
strategy? I say go ram yourself into that wall as often as you can, because
there's a small probability that you can suddenly find yourself on the other
side. This is what happens in alpha decay. In alpha decay, there's helium
nuclei sitting inside a nucleus. There's a barrier that keeps it from coming
out of the nucleus, but the barrier goes up and comes down. So if you go a
certain distance from the nucleus, you're again free. So the alpha particle
does exactly what I told you. It goes rattling back and forth inside the
nucleus and once in a while, it penetrates and comes to the other side, and
that's the alpha decay of the nucleus. So this really happens. It may not
happen to you in the situation I described, but the probability is not zero.</p>
