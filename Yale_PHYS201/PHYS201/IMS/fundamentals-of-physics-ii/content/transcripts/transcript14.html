<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Before we start today's lecture, I just wanted to explain to you that at the
end of the class, I have to run out and catch a plane. So if you have to
discuss any other administrative matters, you should do it now, because you
won't find me after class. I couldn't take this weather. You know where I'm
going? Seattle. That's the story of my life. So nothing else? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is there going to
be an equation sheet for the midterm and if so, is it possible to get it?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
You will get the equation sheet. Do you want it now? No. With the exam?
Yeah. I don't give it out before, but you will have all the reasonable
equations on that sheet. You know the reason for that, right? The reason is
that some of you may be going into medicine and you control the anesthesia on
me, one of these days in the future. If I held back the equation sheet, I know
you will hold back the painkillers. It's just making a deal, the way things
are done nowadays. I made a deal with you guys. I couldn't sleep last night,
because today is when we're going to solve Maxwell's equations and get the
waves. I just couldn't wait to get to work. It's great. No matter how many
times I talk about it, I just find it so amazing. </p>
<p>So here are these
great Maxwell equations. I'm going to write them down. Those are the
equations. The first one tells you that if you draw any surface and integrate <i>B</i>
over that surface, namely, you're counting the net number of lines coming out,
you're going to get 0. That's because lines begin and end with charges and
there are no magnetic charges. If you look at any magnetic field problem, the
lines don't have a beginning or an end. They end on themselves. So if you put
any surface there, whatever goes in has to come out. That's the statement of
no magnetic charges. This one says, yes, there are things that manufacture
electric field lines called charges. They make them and they eat them.
Depending on how many got in the volume, the net will decide the flux out of
that volume. This one, without that, used to say electric field is a
conservative field. It defines a potential and so on. But then we found in
the time dependent problem, <i>E&#8901;dl</i>, we said rate of change of the magnetic field. So
changing magnetic field sustains an electric field. And this one says a
changing electric field can produce a magnetic field. In addition, a current
can also produce a magnetic field. </p>
<p>This is what we have
to begin with. Now I'm going to eventually focus on free space. Free space
means we're nowhere near charges and currents. And the equations become more
symmetric. This has got no surface integral, that has got no surface
integral. The line integral of this guy is essentially the rate of change of
flux of that. And the line integral of that guy is - the rate of change of
flux of this. If I'm going to get a wave equation, the triumphant moment is
when I do this and do that and out comes the wave equation. But if at that
moment you have not seen the wave equation, you're not going to get the
thrill. So I have to know, how many people remember the wave equation from the
first part of the course? Okay, so I think I have to remind you of what that
is. It's a bit like explaining a joke, but still, I have to do that, because
otherwise we won't have that climactic moment. </p>
<p>So let me tell you
one example of a wave equation. People have seen them before. Here is the
simplest example. You take a string, you tie it between two fixed points and
it has a tension <i>T</i>. Tension is the force with which the two ends are
being pulled. Then you distort it in some form and you release it, and you see
what happens. Now let's measure <i>x</i> as the distance from the left end and
<i>y</i> as the height at that time <i>t</i>. The wave equation tells you an
equation governing the behavior of <i>y</i>. It tells you how <i>y</i>
varies. Now if you want to do that, you may think you have to invent new
stuff, but you don't. Everything comes from Newton's laws. That's to me the
amazing part, that you have these equations, then of course the Lorentz force
equations. Then you've got Newton's laws and that's all we have up to this
point in the course. So there should be no need to invoke anything beyond
Newton's laws to find out the fate of this string. And namely, we are going to
apply <i>F = ma</i>, but not to the whole string at one time, because <i>a</i>
is the acceleration and whose acceleration are we talking about? Piece of
string here, piece of string there? It can all be moving at different rates. </p>
<p>So you pick a tiny
portion, which I'm going to blow up for your benefit. That's a piece of
string. Its interval, it lies under region of length <i>dx</i>. In other
words, you take a <i>dx</i> here and look at that string. It is being pulled
like that with a tension <i>T</i> and it's being pulled like this with a
tension <i>T</i> here. That's the meaning of tension, pulled at both ends. If
this was a perfectly straight segment, there'll be no net force on it, because
these forces will cancel. But if it's slightly curved, then this line and that
line are not quite in the same direction and the forces don't have to cancel.
So let's take that force and write its vertical part. If this angle is <i>&#952;</i>,
<i>T</i> times sin<i>&#952;</i> is the force here. -<i>T</i> times (because <i>T</i>
is pointing the opposite way)--let me call this <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i>
is the angle you have here. Do you understand? The vertical force is
restoring the strength to where it was is what I'm focused on. So you resolve
that force into a vertical part, up and this one has the vertical part down.
Now if <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub> = &#952;<sub>2</sub></i> they cancel and that's what I just
said. But <i>&#952;<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i> are generally not
equal, because if I go to the top of the string, for example, this end is
pulling this way, that end is pulling that way. There's a net force down. So
you have a net force because this angle or the tangent to the string is
changing with position. </p>
<p>That's why they don't
cancel. Now the approximation I'm going to make is that theta is small,
measured in radians, and I remind you that sin<i>&#952;</i> is essentially <i>&#952;</i>
- very small corrections. And cosine <i>&#952;</i> is 1 &#8722; <i>&#952;<sup>2</sup></i>/2 +
corrections. And tan<i>&#952;</i>, which is the ratio of these guys, is <i>&#952;</i> +
other corrections. For a very small <i>&#952;</i>, you forget that, you forget
that. You keep things of order theta in every equation. So for small angles,
cosine is just 1, and sin<i>&#952;</i> is <i>&#952;</i>. If you do that, and sin<i>&#952;</i>
and tan<i>&#952;</i> being equal, I can write it as tan<i>&#952;<sub>1</sub></i> - tan<i>&#952;<sub>2</sub></i>.
But that's in the approximation, where tan and sine are all roughly equal.
That is really <i>T</i> times <i>dy/dx</i> at the point <i>x + dx</i> &#8722; <i>dy/dx</i>
at the point <i>x</i>. Are you with me? <i>dy/dx</i> from calculus, you
remember, is the slope. It's a partial derivative. Why is it a partial
derivative now? Can you tell me? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's all dependent
on time.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It can depend on time and I'm doing <i>F = ma </i>at one instant in time. So I
don't want to take this guy's slope now and that guy's slope an hour later. I
want them at the same time, at a fixed time. Now what do I do with this? Have
I taught you guys how to handle a difference like this? There's one legacy I
want to leave behind is what to do when confronted with a difference like
this. You have any idea what to do? Pardon me? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Multiply by one.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Multiply by one. Then what do you do with that? I'm asking you to evaluate the
difference between this guy at <i>x + dx </i>- the same thing at <i>x</i>.
What is it equal to approximately for small <i>dx</i>? Let me ask you another
question. Suppose I have <i>f</i> of <i>x + dx </i>and I subtract from it <i>f</i>
of <i>x</i>, what is it equal to?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
If I divide by <em>&#916;x</em> and take the limit, it becomes a derivative. If I don't
divide by <em>&#916;x</em>, this is then <em>df/dx</em> times <em>&#916;x</em>. There may be other corrections, but
when <em>&#916;x</em> goes to 0, you may make that approximation. That is the meaning of the
rate of change. If I tell you, here's a function and that's the same function
somewhere to the right, what's the difference? That's what the role of the
derivative is, to tell you how much it changes. This slope changes from here
to there, therefore it's a derivative of something which is already a
derivative, so it's <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sup>2</sup></i> times <em>&#916;x</em>. In other
words, the f I'm using here is itself <em>dy/dx</em> and the <em>df/dx</em> is then the second
derivative. So that's the force. Now that force we must equate to ma. That's
the easy part. </p>
<p>What is the mass of
this section, this portion of string? If the mass per unit length is &#956;,
that's the mass of that section. Then what's the acceleration. Acceleration
is the rate at which y is going up and down. That is <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2</sup></i>.
Canceling the &#916;x, we get this wave equation which says <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sup>2</sup></i>
- <em>&#956;</em> over T <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2</sup></i> is 0, and that's the origin of
the wave equation. Any time you get something like this, you call it the wave
equation. I'm going to write this as <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sup>2</sup></i> - 1
over v<sup>2</sup> <i>d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2 </sup></i>= 0 where v is &#8730;(<i>T/&#956;</i>).
I use the symbol <i>v</i>, because this will turn out to be the velocity of
waves on that string. Namely, if you pluck the string and make a little bump
here, let it go, the bump will move and v is going to be the speed at which it
moves. The speed of waves is determined by the tension and the mass per unit
length. </p>
<p>Now I want to show
you that this really is the velocity of the wave. How do we know that's the
velocity? It's got dimensions of velocity, but maybe it's not the velocity of
this wave. Maybe it's something else. I want to show you that <i>v</i> stands
for the velocity of the waves in this medium. The way you do that is you ask
yourself, what is the nature of the solutions to this equation? If <i>y(x,t) </i>satisfied
the equation, what can you say about its functional form? What functions do
you think will play a role? Does anybody have any idea what kind of functions
may play a role?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Sine function?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Sines maybe. With single oscillators, when you have something something is <i>d/dt
</i>squared, you had cosine <i>&#969;t</i>. Whatever you can do for <i>t </i>you
can do for <i>x</i>. You can have a cosine in <i>x</i>. So you might think
it is all sines and cosines and exponentials. All that is true, but it turns
out the range of solutions is much bigger than that. I'm going to write down for
you the most generation solution to the wave equation, namely what's the
constraint it imposes on the function? The answer is this: <i>y</i> can be any
function you want of <i>x - vt</i>. I don't care what function it is. So if I
call <i>z</i> as a single variable <i>x - vt</i>, <i>y</i> can be a function of
this single combination, <i>x - vt</i>. In other words, <i>y</i> can depend on
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> can depend on <i>t.</i> If it depends on <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>
in an arbitrary way, of course it won't satisfy this equation. But I'm telling
you that if it depends on <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> only through this combination, <i>x
- vt</i>, it will satisfy the wave equation. In other words, here's the
function. You don't even have to think,<i> x - vt </i>squared over some number <i>x<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>.
</p>
<p>That's a completely
good solution to the wave equation. I guarantee if you took this, it would
satisfy the wave equation, because it's a function only of x - vt. A function
that's not a good function is <i>y = e<sup> &#8722;x2</sup> &#8722; v<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup></i>.
That&#39;s not a function of <i>x - vt</i>. That won't satisfy the wave equation.
So why is that true is what I want to show you. Let us take <i>dy/dx</i>.
Remember, <i>y</i> depends only on this combination <i>z</i>, therefore it equals<i>
df/dz </i>times <i>dz/dx</i>. But <i>z</i> is <i>x - vt</i>, <i>dz/dx </i>is
1, so it's just <i>df/dz</i>. Now let me rush through this and do it one more
time. Everything will go the same way. You will get this. But how about <i>dy/dt</i>?
If you want <i>dy/dt</i>, again you take <i>df/dz </i>times <i>dz/dt</i>. But
that gives you--this should be written as a partial&#8211;<i>dz/dt </i>is <i>df/dz </i>times
-<i>v</i>. Can you see that? By the chain rule, you take any function you
have, first differentiate with respect to <i>z</i>. Then differentiate <i>z</i>
with respect to <i>x</i> and with respect to <i>t</i>. If you do an <i>x</i>
derivative, you get 1. If you do a <i>t </i>derivative, you get -<i>v</i>. </p>
<p>Now if I do it
twice--again, I don't want to spend too much time--if I do it twice, I'm going
to skip the intermediate step. I'll get a -<i>v</i> and a &#8722;<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>.
It follows then that if I took 1/<i>v<sup>2</sup></i> times that, can you see
that now? 1/<i>v<sup>2</sup> d<sup>2</sup>y/dt<sup>2</sup> </i>is the same as <i>v<sup>2</sup>y
dx<sup>2</sup></i>. Therefore to satisfy the wave equation, it can be any
function at all, as long as it depends on <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> in the
combination <i>x - vt</i>. That is just a mathematical fact. You just have to
do the chain rule, you will find that it's true. But more importantly, I want
you to understand what it tells you about the wave propagation. Let me pick <i>x<sub>0</sub>
</i>= 1 for convenience. Let me plot this guy at time <i>t</i> = 0. This
solution looks like <i>e</i> to the -<i>x</i> squared, which is a function like
that, at <i>t</i> = 0. What does it look like at <i>t </i>= 1 second? </p>
<p>Think about it.  <i>t</i>
= 1 second looks like <i>e</i> to the -<i>x - v </i>whole squared. That means
it's the same bump, shifted by an amount <i>v</i>. See this function <i>x - v</i>
squared behaves with respect to <i>x = v </i>the same as the original function
around <i>x</i> = 0. Whatever happens to this guy here happens to that guy at
distance <i>v</i> to the right. You can see that if you wait <i>t</i> seconds,
it would have moved a distance <i>vt</i>. That's why you understand that <i>vt</i>,
<i>v</i> is the velocity of propagation, because what this is telling you is
that if you start the system out with some configuration at time <i>t</i>, <i>t</i>
= 0, later on the function looks like the same function translated to the right
at a velocity <i>v</i>. That means its profile, whatever profile you have, is
just moved to the right. Now can you think of another family of solutions
besides this one? Why should the wave move to the right? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's <i>x + vt</i>.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Do you understand that if it was <i>x + vt</i>, you go through this derivation,
you'd get a +<i>v<sup>2</sup> </i>instead of a &#8722;<i>v<sup>2</sup></i> and that
doesn't matter. So the answer is, the most general solution to the wave
equation is any function you like of <i>x - vt</i> + any function you like of <i>x
+ vt</i>. This will describe waves going to the right; that will describe
waves going to the left, and you can superpose them. Because it's a linear equation,
you can add solutions. This is what I want you to know about the wave
equation. This is one example of how the wave equation comes and what the
meaning of the symbol v is. </p>
<p>Now let me go to the
old Maxwell equations. Now I want to do them and ask myself. I'm going to
write down a solution and I'm going to see if it obeys these four Maxwell
equations. If I write down a solution for the electric field and the magnetic
field, they have to obey all those conditions, those four equations. That means,
let's take first the case of working in a vacuum, when there is no current,
when there is no charge. So you want a surface integral of <i>E</i> on any
surface to be 0 and the surface integral of <i>B</i> on any surface to be 0.
Look at the surface integral first. Do you understand? </p>
<p>This was never going
to be non-zero. This will be non-zero near matter but we are far from any
charges, so there is nothing to enclose in the volume. There are no charges
there. Look at those equations. I give you a function and I say, &quot;Tell me
if it satisfies Maxwell's equations,&quot; what do you have to do?
Operationally, what is it that you have to do? Any ideas on what you must do
at this point to test? Any ideas? What do you have to see of a potential
solution? Come on, this is not the New York subway. You can make eye contact.
What is this? You have no idea what you may have to do? What if I give you a
function and say, &quot;See if it satisfies the wave equation,&quot; what will
you do then? Take the function and then what? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Differentiate it
and see--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Yes! Take <i>x</i> derivative, <i>y</i> derivative and all that, second
derivative. If it vanishes, you'll say it satisfies it, right? That's what it
means to satisfy it. If I give you fields <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> that depends
on space and time and I want you to verify if it satisfies this, what do you
have to do, is what I'm asking?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Come up with a
situation?</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
No, it must be true in every situation. In other words, what's the surface on
which this integral is done? On what surface do we do the integral? Pardon
me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Closed.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Closed. But beyond closed, anything else? Where is it located? How big is
it? Pardon me?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b>
[inaudible]</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
I didn't hear that.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It's everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
It could be anywhere and it could have any size. It could have any shape. And
it must be true for all those surfaces. So if I just give you a field, <i>E</i>
(<i>x,y,z </i>and <i>t</i>), it's a lot of work, right? Draw all possible
surfaces. On them, you can take the surface, divide it into patches, do the
surface integral patch by patch, and you better keep getting 0. When you're
done with that, then you take the magnetic field. Then the other two Maxwells
tell you, take a loop, any loop, go round that and do the line integral of <i>B</i>.
That should be the flux crossing it, the electric flux or magnetic flux. And
it should be done for every loop and for every surface. You realize that looks
impossible. But there is a quicker way to verify all of these equations, and
the quick way is the following: if these equations are true for a tiny loop,
in this case, true for a tiny volume or a tiny surface enclosing a tiny volume,
then it's true for big ones. And likewise, if true for a tiny loop, it is true
for any arbitrary loop. In other words, if I can show that at any arbitrary
point, if I pick an infinitesimal loop or infinitesimal surface, and these guys
satisfy these equations on an infinitesimal thing, it's going to satisfy it on
a macroscopic thing. </p>
<p>That's what we want
to understand. How does that come about? It comes about due to a very
beautiful way in which we define the sum of two surfaces. So here is a
surface. I'm going to take everything to be a cube, but it's not important.
Here's a surface. Let's call it <i>S<sub>1</sub></i>. And it's got its
outward normal. That's the definition of surface integral is you draw the
normals pointing outwards and you take <i>E&#8901;dA</i> on every face of the
cube and add it. The area vector is defined to be outward pointing normal to
every face. So you take the little cube. <i>E</i> may be pointing this way
there or that way there, but you take the dot product of the area and you add
them. Then I take a second cube here. Let's see. It's got its own outward
normal. This is surface 2. Now imagine gluing this guy to this guy, so it
looks like this. You glue this common face. Bring that surface over and glue
them with that face common to both. Then I claim that the surface integral on
this one + the surface integral on that one is the surface integral on the
union of the two. In other words, let's see, take one cube, take another cube,
and that surface integral will be the same as on a longer object. I don't know
what this is called, something over that. The two cubes used to be sharing
this. Do you understand why? </p>
<p>Let's understand why
the integral on this guy, which is, if you want, two cubes joined to form a
rectangular solid. That surface integral is the sum of these two surface
integrals. Think for a minute about why that is true. If you compare them,
piece by piece, this face matches that face. This face matches that half.
This one matches that half. But something is missing in this that's present
here, do you agree? What is it we don't have? What's missing in the equal
union? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Two sides equal
_________.</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
The two common faces are missing in the big surface, but it does not matter.
The two common faces do not matter because when you do the surface on
the first one, the outward normal will point out of that, whereas if you do it
on the second one, the outward normal will point into the other one. When you
glue them together, the common face is opposite orientations. Consequently,
the surface integral on the big solid is equal to the sum of the surface in
integrals in the two small solids. Do you follow that? That's the way it
works. Then you can go on adding more and more pieces to this, right, and you
can build like Legos and arbitrarily complicated blob. Remember, these are all
very, very tiny volumes, so you can build them up to look like a big thing. It
may look like a pyramid. If you look very closely, you'll have the steps like
in a real pyramid, but the steps here can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore
if the surface integral was 0 on every little piece that made up the big
object, then it's going to be 0 on the big object, because the integral on the
big object is the integral of the tiny pieces that make up the big object. </p>
<p>This is a very
profound idea, because the big object has fewer surfaces than the small ones,
because when you cut it, you create two new surfaces, but they don't contribute
between the two of them, because they cancel. And in particular, if the surface
integral had not been 0, but because of matter it was equal to charge inside
volume 1, and this right hand side of this one was the charge inside volume 2,
you can see that the surface integral on the bigger surface will be the sum of
the two charges. So anything you're trying to prove about surface integrals,
even if the right hand side is not 0, if it is true in a tiny cube, true in a
union of two cubes and then in a union of any number of these tiny guys,
therefore on any surface. That's the thing to remember. What we will do then
is not to take arbitrary surfaces, but infinitesimal surfaces and we'll prove
for them that the Maxwell equations are satisfied for the solution that I come
up with. Then you're guaranteed that it will work for an arbitrary surface. </p>
<p>When you do line
integrals--this is for surface integral--line integral is even easier. Suppose
I'm taking the line integral of some function around this loop. This is loop <i>L<sub>1</sub></i>.
I take a line integral of some field on L<sub>1</sub>. Then somebody wants to
do a line integral on <i>L<sub>2</sub> </i>that looks like this, <i>E&#8901;dl</i> on line 2. </p>
<p>You agree that this +
that really is the same as the line integral on the union of the two loops
where you delete the common edge. You have to understand this. I will not
leave any child behind. You have to know why this is true. I'm taking a lot of
time so you know where it's coming from. If you compare an integral of any
field on the big rectangle compared to the two squares, the only difference is
that the two squares had these two sides, but they were doing them in opposite
directions, so it does not matter. So if the line integral of this, for
example, was some flux coming out of this one, and the line integral of that
was the rate of change of flux coming out of that one, if it was true, then
it's guaranteed that the line integral on the big rectangle will be the sum of
the fluxes or the rate of the change of fluxes coming out of both. So any
Maxwell equation, if it's true for a tiny square, infinitesimal square, will be
also true for anything bigger. There's only one subtlety when you do loops and
that's the following: if you're living in a plane, you can prove the result for
the plane in the plane of the blackboard, because there no loop I cannot form
by joining these guys. </p>
<p>But we live in three
dimensions so that we may have a loop like this, floating in three dimensions.
Then what you have to do is, you've got to find any surface with a loop as a
boundary, maybe this dome. Then the integral on--let me hide this for you.
This is the part behind; this is the part you can see. That's the same as
tiling it into little squares and doing an integral on each one of them like
this. You have a dome of some big building, you take little tiles and you tile
the building. Then all the interior edges cancel, and all that remains is the edge
that is the edge of the original surface. So even in 3D it's going to work,
but now you should be ready for loops that are not lying in the <i>xy</i>
plane. So you will have to prove it for the three independent loops. You will
have to prove it for an infinitesimal loop in that plane, infinitesimal in that
plane, infinitesimal in that plane. If it's true for three independent
directions, then by combining those little pieces, you can make yourself any
surface you want. </p>
<p>In other words, I'm
saying, given a rim, you can build any surface with the rim as the boundary.
If you can take the little flat pieces in any orientation, and it's enough to
have them in the <i>xy, yz</i>, and <i>zx</i> planes. So the strategy that I'm
going to follow, this is something one can skip, but I wanted you to know the
details, if you really want to know where everything comes from. I'm going to
write down or search for a solution to Maxwell equations. I'm going to make it
have a certain form. You remember how we do this with equations. We assume a
certain form, stick it into the equation, play with some parameters till it
works. I'm going to make it work on infinitesimal loops and infinitesimal
cubes and that's going to be enough, because if it works on this tiny loop, it
works in a big loop, works in a tiny cube, works on a big cube or arbitrary
surface. </p>
<p>So let us write down
the functional form that I'm going to use. The functional form that I'm going
to use looks like this. I'm going to take an electric field that is entirely
in the <i>z</i> direction and the <i>z</i> field will depend on <i>y</i> and <i>t</i>.
And I'm going to take a magnetic field which is going to be in the <i>x</i>
direction and the <i>B</i> field is going to depend on the <i>y</i> and<i> t.</i>
So let me tell you how my axes are defined here. This is <i>x,</i> this is <i>y</i>,
this is <i>z</i>. The electric and magnetic fields, the electric field will
always point along the <i>z</i> axis. The magnetic field will always point
along the<i> x </i>axis. They will not vary, as you vary <i>x</i> or <i>z</i>.
They'll vary only if you vary <i>y</i> by assumption. In general, it can vary
with everything, but I'm trying as a modest goal to find a simple solution
which has a dependence on only two of the four possible coordinates. It
depends on only <i>y</i> and <i>t</i>, rather than <i>x, y, z </i>and <i>t</i>.
Let's get any solution. We cannot get every possible one; let's get something
and something, I assume, has this form. So this is called a plane wave,
because if you take the plane <i>y</i> = 0, <i>E</i>and <i>B</i> are constant
on that plane. Because when <i>y</i> is fixed or some value, <i>E</i> and <i>B</i>
are not changing as you vary <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>. So you should think of it
as plane after plane and on each plane, the field is doing something. It's
doing the same thing. If I draw a plane here, that field is a constant. <i>E</i>
is a constant and that plane and <i>B</i> is a constant on that plane. </p>
<p>On another plane, it
could be a different constant, but within the plane, it varies from plane to
plane. So that is not an axiom, that's not a law. That's an assumed
simplicity in the function I'm looking at. There's no theorem that says that
every solution to Maxwell equations much obey this condition. In general, these
functions will be functions of <i>x, y, z</i> and <i>t</i>. The trick will be
superposition. If I can get a solution that depends only <i>y</i> and <i>t</i>,
and you can get a solution that depends on <i>z</i> and <i>t</i>, I can add
them up and they will still be a solution, because the wave equation is
linear. You can add solutions. Then our sum of the two solutions will be a
function of <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>. You can bring in the <i>x</i> and so on.
So you do the simplest one, then you can add them. So here is my function and
I have to know what I can say about these two functions. You understand? In
general, the electric field has three components, the magnetic field has three
components. Each of them depends on four quantities, <i>x, y, z </i>and <i>t</i>.
Big mess. In our simplified solution, the only unknown component of <i>E</i>
is <i>E<sub>z</sub></i>. I'm assuming there is no <i>E<sub>x</sub> </i>and
there is no <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>. And there is no <i>B<sub>y</sub></i> and
there is no <i>B<sub>z</sub></i>. </p>
<p>Now you might say,
&quot;Why don't you go a little further? Kill the <i>B</i> also.&quot; You can
try that. If you kill the <i>B</i>, you will find the only solution is to get
everything equals 0. So by trial and error, we know this is the first time you
can get something interesting going. If you make it simpler than that, you get
nothing. You can make it more complicated, but not simpler. </p>
<p>So now, will this
satisfy the surface integral condition? Let's check that? So what do I need
to do for that? I have to take a cube, right? Let me take the cube. It's
infinitesimal, but I'm just keeping it near the origin. It can be anywhere you
want, but I'm drawing it near the origin. It's a surface, and it's got these
outward going normals. And I must take <i>E</i> &#8901; surface area for every face. And I've got to get 0.
That's the condition. So is that going to work or not? Let us see. There are
six faces in this cube, so I'm going to draw 1, 2 and 3 that I can see, and -1,
-2 and -3 refer to the faces on the opposite side. This is 3, that's -3. </p>
<p>So I can only show
you 1, 2 and 3. Let's look at surface 1 and ask what I get from the surface
integral of <i>E</i>. Do you agree that <i>E</i> points this way? So <i>E&#8901;dA</i> is a non-zero
contribution on surface 1. But on surface -1, <i>E</i> still points up, but <i>dA</i>
points down, because <i>E</i> doesn&#39;t vary from the upper face to the lower
face, because in going from upper to lower, I'm varying the coordinate <i>z</i>,
but nothing depends on <i>z</i>. The same electric field is sitting on the
upper plane of this cube as on the lower plane of the cube. Therefore the
surface integrals will cancel and give you 0, because the area vectors are
opposite. That is a simple statement, that if you've got a constant electric
field going through a cube, the net flux will be 0 because what's coming in on
one side goes out of the other side. So that's the cancelation of 1 and -1 giving
me 0. But there are other faces, like 3 and -3. What surface integral will I
get from 3? The area vector looks like this, the electric field looks like
that, the dot product is 0. In other words, the field lines are parallel to
this face, so they are not going to penetrate it. You're not going to get any
flux. Or the area vector is perpendicular to the field vector. </p>
<p>So on this face, <i>E</i>
is 0, on the opposite face is also 0. The same thing goes for 2 and -2. If
you go to face number 2 here, the electric field is pointing like that, but
there is no flux and there is no flux on the opposite face. So if you get 0,
either because the field is parallel to the face, or if it's perpendicular, it
has the same value on opposite faces, with opposite pointing normals, or
opposite pointing area vectors and you get 0. That's how you get the surface
integral of <i>E</i> to be 0 on this tiny cube. But if it's 0 on a tiny cube,
it's 0 on anything you can build out of tiny cubes. That means 0 on any
surface. If you repeat the calculation for <i>B</i>, you'll get pretty much
the same logic, except that <i>B</i> now points like this. So on the top face,
<i>B</i> will have no flux because it's running along the face. There is no
flow through that. Top and bottom are 0 and 0. The only faces that matter are
2 and -2, because 2 is coming out of the board and <i>B</i> is coming out of
the board. But on the other face, which you cannot see, the -2, <i>B</i> is
still going this way, but <i>E</i>, the area vector is going the opposite way.
The key to this is that <i>B</i> does not vary. </p>
<p>You see, if the flux
was not constant, if the field was not constant, the fact that you've got two
faces with opposite pointing area vectors doesn't mean the answer is 0. Even
though the area vectors are opposite, the field strength would be bigger on one
face, smaller on the opposite face, in which case they won't cancel. But the
field is not varying in the coordinate in which I've displaced the planes.
That's the reason you get 0 for both of those. All right. So far what I've
shown you is that the solution I have automatically satisfies 0 surface
integral without any further assumptions. Of course, it's very important that <i>E</i>
did not vary with <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>. But with the assumed form, I don't
have to worry. I still have to only worry about the other two Maxwell
equations involving line integrals. I've got to make sure that works out. </p>
<p>So let's see. So
here I have to take loops and I told you, when you take loops now, you've got
to take loops in that plane, that plane, and that plane, because it takes three
kinds of little flat Lego pieces to form a curved surface in 3D. </p>
<p>So let me take this
loop first. I want to take an infinitesimal loop that looks like this. I
choose the orientation of this so that if I do the right hand rule, the area
vector is pointing in the positive y direction. In other words, this is a tiny
loop of size <i>&#916;y</i>--let's see. <i>&#916;x</i> this way and <i>&#916;z</i> that way.
The area vector is coming out like that. So I have to now look at the line
integral of <i>E&#8901;dl</i> and equate it to -<i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>B</sub></i><i>/dt</i>. I have to see, is
that true or false? Well, take this loop and look at the line integral of <i>E</i>
and see what happens. There is an <i>E</i> going up this face. <i>E</i> is
perpendicular to that face , and <i>E</i> is perpendicular to that
edge. <i>E</i> is anti-parallel to this edge. You see that? If <i>E</i> is
pointing up, it cancels between these two. These two have no contribution,
because <i>E</i> is perpendicular to <i>dl</i>. But these two cancel. They
cancel again because the <i>E</i> that you have here going up is the same <i>E</i>
that you have here also going up, but the <i>dl</i> is going in opposite
directions. Therefore <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i> around this tiny loop is actually 0. You understand why
it is 0? Cancelation between opposite edges, and two edges that don't give you
anything. So what we hope for is that on the right hand side, there better not
be any magnetic flux coming out of this thing, because otherwise right hand
side will give you a non-zero contribution. </p>
<p>But luckily, that is
the case, because the magnetic field looks like this. It's in the plane of
this loop. The dot product of the area vector, which is perpendicular to the
loop and the <i>B</i> field is 0, so that's also 0. So this is identically
satisfied on that loop. Now if you take line integral of <i>B</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i>, and that's supposed
to be + <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub> d</i><i>&#934;</i><i>/dt </i>of the electric flux, again, you should try
to do the exercise with me. Magnetic field, I said, is going in the <i>x</i>
direction, so it has nothing to do with those two edges, because they are
perpendicular to it, but it cancels between these two. It cancels because the
edges are going in the opposite direction, but <i>B</i> doesn't vary from this
edge to that edge. It varies only with y, so again you get 0. And there is no
electric flux coming out of this surface, because electric field lines also lie
in the plane of that loop. They don't cross it. So those equations are also
satisfied. </p>
<p>But I'm not done,
because I still have to consider loops in this plane and loops in that plane.
So far I've gotten no conditions at all. What this means so far is that there
are no further restrictions on <i>E<sub>z</sub> </i>and <i>B<sub>x</sub></i>.
They can be anything you like. But I'm going to get restrictions by finally
considering loops in this plane and loops in that plane. So let's see how you
get conditions on one of them. </p>
<p>This is <i>x, y, z</i>.
So let's take a loop that looks like this. I've chosen it so that with the
right hand rule, the area vector is perpendicular and coming out the x axis. I
remind you once again, <i>E</i> looks like that, and <i>B</i> looks like this.
So let me give the edges a name, 1, 2, 3, 4. And let's take the condition <i>E</i><b>&#8901;</b><i>dl</i> = - <i>d/dt </i>of
the magnetic flux. Now this loop has dimension <i>dy</i> in this direction, <i>dz
</i>in that direction. This is an infinitesimal loop. I've drawn it so you
can see it, but it's infinitesimal. Okay, so what do I get on the right hand
side? Right hand side says &#8722;<i>d/dt </i>of the magnetic flux coming out of the
board. The magnetic flux is coming out like this, right? It's coming out of
the blackboard, so there really is a magnetic flux. That magnetic flux is the
number I wrote down, <i>B<sub>x</sub></i> times the loop area which is <i>dy/dz</i>.
That gives me - <i>&#916;y&#916;z B<sub>x</sub> dt</i>. That's the right hand side.
This loop is so tiny, I am approximating <i>B</i> by the value at the center if
you like. You might say, &quot;Look, I don't think <i>B</i> is a constant on
the loop. <i>B</i> is varying. Why do you take the value of the
center?&quot; Well, if it varies, the variation is proportional to <i>&#916;x</i>
. I'm to <i>&#916;y </i>or <i>&#916;z</i>, therefore that will be a term proportional to
<i>&#916;y</i> squared or <i>&#916;z </i>squared. But we are going to keep things to
first order in <i>&#916;y </i>and <i>&#916;z</i>, so it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Now how about the
left hand side? If you look at the left hand side, I hope you'll try to do
this one. If you go like that on edge 2, you will get <i>E<sub>z</sub></i>
times<i> &#916;z </i>--I'm sorry. Let me write it as <i>&#916;z</i> times <i>E<sub>z</sub></i>
at the point <i>y</i> + <i>&#916;y</i>. And on this edge, I will get - <i>&#916;z </i>times
<i>E<sub>z</sub> </i>at the point <i>y</i>. In other words, the electric field
is everywhere, going up, so it goes up here. <i>E</i> is parallel to it, so
that should be that times <i>&#916;z</i>. These two don't contribute, because <i>E</i>
and &#916;<i>L</i> are perpendicular, so forget that. But this one, it goes in the
opposite direction, so I subtract it, but I bear in mind that this is <i>y + &#916;y</i>,
but that's only<i> y</i>. So here I hope you guys will know what to do. You
will say that is then roughly equal to <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i> times <i>&#916;y</i>.
Therefore the line integral of the electric field is proportional to the
derivative of <i>dz</i> with respect to <i>y,</i> times the area of the loop.
And the surface integral of the flux change is also proportional to the area of
the loop, and you get <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dt</i>. So this is the final equation
you get by considering that loop. So what is remarkable is the line integral
and the surface integral are both proportional to the area. The surface integral
being proportional to the area of the loop is obvious, because it's the surface
integral. </p>
<p>Why is the line
integral proportional to the area? Because one part of the line integral is
the width of the loop, <i>&#916;z</i>, other one comes in because the extent to
which they don't cancel is due to the derivative of the field in the transverse
direction. That brings you a <i>&#916;y</i>. So if you cancel all of this, you get
the equation that I'm interested in, which is very important: <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i>
= -<i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dt</i>. This came from looking at this equation. </p>
<p>The last one, another
loop equation, I'm going to go through somewhat quickly, because it's going to
be 0 = 0. Suppose I take the integral of the magnetic field around this loop.
Do you understand why it is 0? The magnetic field is coming out of the
blackboard. <i>dl</i>&#39;s are all lying in the plane, so line integral of <i>B</i>
is then 0. And that better be equal to -<i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub> d</i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>electric</sub></i><i>/dt</i>. That is the case,
because there is no electric flux coming out of this face. The electric lines
are in the plane of the loop. There is no electric flux, there is no rate of
change, so it's 0 = 0. </p>
<p>So from this loop,
I've managed to get one equation. So my plan now is, I don't want to do yet
another loop, because you've got the idea, or it's not going to help to draw
one more loop. But I would just say that if you draw the last loop, which lies
in what plane? Which lies in this plane. You will get one more equation. I'm
just going to tell you what it is. I got <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i> is -<i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dt</i>.
You'll get another equation, <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy </i>= - &#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub><i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dt</i>.
So I confess, that I've not derived this one, but it's going to involve just
drawing one more loop and doing it. Now it's really up to you guys how much
you want to do this, but you should at least have some idea what we did. It
turns out these are the only restrictions I have to satisfy. If this is true
of my field, I'm done, because I've satisfied every Maxwell equation. Every
surface integral was 0 on every tiny cube and therefore 0 everywhere for <i>E</i>
and <i>B</i>. The line integrals, some were identically satisfied, some were 0
= 0. There were some that led to non trivial conditions and it's these two.
Therefore I'm told that if the fields that I pick, that depend on y and t, have
the property that the y derivative of this guy is the t derivative of that guy,
and the y derivative of <i>B<sub>x</sub></i> is up to some constant, the -t
derivative of the other guy, you're done. </p>
<p>That's all you
require of that function. So let's do the following: take this equation, take
its y derivative on both sides. IN other words, I want to take y derivative of
this and I want to take y derivative of that. Then here you will get <i>d<sup>2</sup>E<sub>z</sub>/dy<sup>2</sup></i>
= -<i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy dt</i>. Take the <i>d/dz</i> of this. Now you know
partial derivatives, you can take the derivatives in any order you like, so
let's write it as <i>d/dt</i>, <i>d/dy</i>. But <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy</i> is <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>dE<sub>z</sub>/dt</i>.
Another <i>dt</i> makes it + <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>d<sup>2</sup>E<sub>z</sub>/dt<sup>2</sup></i>.
Take first the y derivative, <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy</i>, is that one single time
derivative. Take one more time derivative, you get this. Now we get this
wonderful--we really have the wave equation now, because I get <i>d<sup>2</sup>E<sub>z</sub>/dy<sup>2</sup></i>
- <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>d<sup>2</sup>E<sub>z</sub>/dt<sup>2</sup></i> =
0, which you recognize to be the wave equation. That's what the wave equation
looks like in the top of the blackboard. But the things that are oscillating
now are not some string. It is really the electric field oscillating. It's not
a medium that's oscillating. There's nothing there. This is all in vacuum. </p>
<p>So let's find the
velocity. <i>v<sup>2</sup></i> will be 1/<i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>,
right? Because this thing that comes with our equation is the 1/<i>v<sup>2</sup></i>
term. Then you go back to your electrostatics and magnetostatics and find out
what these numbers are. And I remind you that &frac14;<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> is 9×10<sup>9</sup>
and <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>/4&Pi;</i> is 10<sup>-7</sup>. </p>
<p>So let's write this
as 4<i>&Pi;/&#956;<sub>0</sub></i> times &frac14;<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>, because we know what
those guys are. &frac14;<i>&Pi;&#949;<sub>0</sub></i> is 9×10<sup>9</sup>. And 4<i>&Pi;/&#956;<sub>0</sub></i><sub>
</sub>is 10<sup>7</sup>, so you get 9×10<sup>16</sup>. Or the velocity is 3×10<sup>8</sup>
meters per second. So this was the big moment in physics, when you suddenly
realize that these things are propagating at the velocity of light. So people
knew the velocity of light from other measurements. They had a fairly good
idea what it was. They know &#956;<sub>0</sub> by doing experiments with currents.
They knew &#949;<sub>0</sub> from Coulomb's law. It's one of the greatest syntheses
that you put them together and out comes an explanation. Now this doesn't mean
that electromagnetic waves are the same as light. You agree that if you run next
to a buffalo at the same speed, you are not a buffalo. You just happen to have
the same speed. So that was a bit of a leap to say it is really light. But it
was also known that whenever you have sparks in electrical circuits and so on,
you see light. So it took a little more than that, but it's quite amazing,
because gravity waves also travel at the speed of light. You cannot assume
that the speed means the same phenomenon. But they were really right this
time. It really was the speed of light. </p>
<p>So we now have a new
understanding of what light it. Light is simply electromagnetic waves
traveling at the speed. It consists of electric and magnetic fields. What we
have is an example of a simple wave, but one can show in general that if you
took the most general <i>E</i>and <i>B</i> you can have, you will get similar
wave equations. You will get it for every component of <i>E</i> and every
component of <i>B</i>. So waves in three dimensions will satisfy the general
wave equation. But I'm not interested in the most general case, because this
is enough to show you where everything comes from. </p>
<p>So you have to think
about how wonderful this is, because you do experiments with charges, with
currents, and you describe the phenomenology as best as you can. Then Maxwell
added that extra term from logical consistency, by taking this capacitor and
drawing different surfaces, and realizing that unless you added the second
term, <i>d</i><i>&#934;</i><i><sub>E</sub></i><i>/dt</i> it didn't work. And
without the second term, you don't get the wave. It's only by adding the
second term and then fiddling with equations, he was able to determine that
waves can travel. So the reason that electromagnetic waves travel in space without
any charges is, once you've got an <i>E</i> field or <i>B</i> field somewhere,
it cannot just disappear. It's like the LC circuit. If your capacitor is
charged, by the time it discharges, it has driven a current in the inductor.
Inductor is like a mass and it's moving with velocity. Current is like
velocity, so it won't stop. So the current keeps going till it charges the
capacitor the opposite way. Then they go back and forth. They are the only 1
degree of freedom, which is the charge in the capacitor or the current in the
circuit, which are related. Here <i>E</i>and <i>B</i> are variables defined
everywhere, but you cannot kill <i>E</i> because the minute you try to destroy <i>E</i>,
you will produce a <i>B</i>. The minute you try to destroy <i>B</i>, you'll
produce an <i>E</i>, so they keep on swapping energy and going back and forth.
So it is self sustaining and it's an oscillation if you like, but it's an
oscillation over all of space, and not over 1 or 2 degrees of freedom. </p>
<p>So I'm going to now
write down a specific form. The specific form I'm going to write down looks
like E = k times E<sub>0</sub>. Now I'm going to pick a particular function,
ky - &#969;t, and I'm going to take B to be I times B<sub>0</sub> sine ky - &#969;t. Now
I'm making a very special function of y and t. Till now, I just said it's a
function of y and t. All I needed was it's a function of y and t. </p>
<p>That was enough to
get me all this. I'm going to find a relation between these constants, <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>
and <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>, by putting them into these two Maxwell equations I
had. That's all I want to do now. So one condition I had was <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i>
was -<i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dt</i>. Then I had <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy</i> is -<i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>dE<sub>z</sub>/dt</i>.
These are the two equations. I'm going to demand that these particular
functions obey these two equations. If they obey these two equations, they
will obey the wave equation, because when I combine this equation with that, I
got the wave equation. Do you understand? I have an equation A and an equation
B, if I put one into the other, I got the wave equation. But you really should
satisfy separately equation A and equation B, because it's not enough to
satisfy the one you get by shoving one in the other. They should be true
independently. </p>
<p>So let's demand that
this be true and demand that be true. So what is <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i>? If
I take the <i>d/dy </i>of this, this is what I call<i> E<sub>z</sub></i> and
this is what I call <i>B<sub>x</sub></i>. <i>dE<sub>z</sub>/dy</i>, if you
take the <i>d/dy </i>of that, will give me<i> kE<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>(ky -
&#969;t).</i> And we want that to be = -<i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dt</i>. So take the <i>d/dt
</i>of this guy. <i>d/dt </i>of this guy is <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>&#969;</i>cos<i>(ky
- &#969;t)</i>. So these things cancel out, then I get <i>B<sub>0</sub>&#969;</i>. So
this tells you that <i>E<sub>0</sub> = &#969;/k B<sub>0</sub></i>. It tells you
about the magnitude of the <i>E</i> and <i>B</i> vectors, what size they should
bear in relation to each other. This is one condition. I'm almost done. So I
want to take this condition now. So <i>dB<sub>x</sub>/dy</i>, what is that
equal to? <i>B<sub>0</sub>k</i>cos<i>(ky - &#969;t)</i> = - <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub>dE<sub>z</sub>/dt
</i>which will be - <i>&#969;E<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>(ky - &#969;t)</i>. Cosines cancel,
then I get a condition <i>B<sub>0</sub>k</i> = <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0</sub></i>&#969;
times <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. But that equals <i>&#969;/c </i>squared times <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>,
because <i>&#956;<sub>0</sub>&#949;<sub>0 </sub></i>is 1/<i>c<sup>2</sup></i>. So I get
a second condition which I can write as <i>E<sub>0</sub></i> = <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>&#969;</i>
times <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>. So these are the two conditions in the end. If
you want the function to look like this traveling wave, with sine waves in it,
then the amplitude for <i>E</i> and the amplitude for <i>B</i> have to satisfy
these two conditions. But look at these two equations. They're both telling
you something about <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. One says <i>E<sub>0</sub></i> should
be <i>&#969;/k </i>times <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>. The other says <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>
should be <i>c<sup>2</sup>/&#969;</i> times <i>B<sub>0</sub></i>. That means <i>&#969;/k </i>better
equal <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>--I bet I dropped a <i>k</i> somewhere.</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>You had <i>B<sub>0</sub>k</i>
in the--</p>
<p><b>Professor Ramamurti
Shankar:</b>
Thank you, yes. So <i>c<sup>2</sup>k/&#969;</i>. That tells me that <i>&#969;<sup>2</sup>=
k<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>&#969; = kc</i> + or -. Or if you like, <i>k</i> is ±<i>&#969;/c</i>.
It doesn&#39;t matter how you write it, but you can see what that means. What this
is telling you is that if you take the function sine <i>ky - &#969;t</i>, and if <i>&#969;
= kc</i>, it becomes sine of <i>ky - kct</i>. That becomes sine of <i>k</i>
times <i>y - ct</i> which is a function of <i>y - ct</i>. In other words, we
knew this was going to happen, because the wave equation says the function
should be a function only of <i>y - ct.</i> That will happen if <i>&#969; = kc</i>.
You see that? If <i>&#969; = kc</i>, you pull the <i>k</i> out, you get <i>y - ct</i>.
Or you can have <i>y + ct</i>, but my solution was <i>y - ct</i>. </p>
<p>I'm almost done. So
the last thing I want to get from this same equation, now that that condition
is satisfied, if <i>&#969;</i> = <i>kc</i>, I get <i>E<sub>0</sub></i> = <i>c</i>
times <i>B</i>. So now I'm going to summarize this. Don't worry
about the details. I will tell you the part you should know all the time. So
I know this is somewhat heavy. I had to do this calculation at home to make
sure I got all the - signs right. There's an orgy of - signs. I'm not that
interested in that. </p>
<p>I know that you guys,
unless you're going to major in physics and want to do it for a lifetime, don't
want to know all that. So what should you know? What you should know is that
by doing a few experiments, one wrote down these Maxwell equations. You've got
to understand a little bit where everything came from. Then the whole class
was demonstrating that they implied some waves and the demonstration was shown
for proving it for infinitesimal loops and infinitesimal cubes and then seeing
what conditions I had. And I found that I could get a set of functions that
are dependent on y and t, and that they really travel at the speed of light.
So that was the bottom line. Actual derivatives and how everything happened is
really not something I expect you to carry in your head, so don't let the exams
ruin that for you. I don't care. I will not quiz you on that part of this
derivation. But you must understand that the structure of physics was such
that it was an interplay between some experiments and some purely theoretical
reasoning on the nature of equations. And you put them together and what makes
it worthwhile in the end is to get fantastic productions like this that unify
electricity and magnetism and light into one shot. </p>
<p>So the picture I get
now, if you look at all of this, the final answer is <i>E</i> looks like <i>k</i>
times some number <i>E<sub>0</sub></i> sine <i>ky</i> - <i>&#969;t</i>. But I want
you to know that &#969; = <i>kc</i> there. Then I get <i>B</i> = <i>IB<sub>0</sub></i>
also the same sine, with the extra restriction that <i>B<sub>0</sub></i> times <i>c</i>
= <i>E<sub>0</sub></i>. </p>
<p>So here is what the
electromagnetic wave looks like. One guy, the electric field, is always living
in this plane. This is the <i>E</i> field. At one instant, if you take a
snapshot, that's what it will be doing, going up there, coming down here, going
up there. That's <i>E</i>. <i>B</i>field looks like this, lies horizontal
here, goes like hat and comes out. So this is in that plane and that is in the
vertical plane. That's horizontal plane, that's the vertical plane. So that is
<i>E</i> and this is <i>B</i>. And the point is, <i>E</i> over <i>B</i> = <i>C</i>.
In other words, <i>E</i> is much bigger than <i>B</i>. The ratio of them is
the velocity of light. This is interesting, because if you took the force on a
charge, you remember is <i>q</i> times <i>E</i> + <b>v</b> x <i>B</i>. That
means if you took an electron and you left it in the electromagnetic field, the
field comes and hits you. If <i>E</i> field is oscillating one way, the <i>B</i>
field is oscillating perpendicularly. </p>
<p>The wave is traveling
in a direction perpendicular to both. If you want, it's in the direction of <i>E</i>
x <i>B</i>, is the direction of propagation of the wave. If it hits an
electron there, the oscillating up and down electric field will make the
electron move up and down. It will also be feeling a magnetic force, <i>V</i> x
<i>B</i>. But notice that the size of <i>B</i> is the size of <i>E</i> divided
by <i>c</i>. So the electric force to magnetic force ratio, or magnetic electric
will be the ratio of <i>v</i> over <i>c</i>. So for most velocities, for
electrons and circuits and so on, the velocity is much tinier than the velocity
of light. So when a radio wave hits your antenna, gets the electric charges in
action, it's the electric field that does most of the forcing, not the magnetic
field. But in astrophysics and cosmic ray physics, where particles can travel
at velocities comparable to that of light, then these forces can become
comparable. </p>
<p>All right, so we
will resume this after the break. I'll see you in the exam. I'll be
traveling, but if you have any worries, any concerns about the exam, you can
email me. I'll look for it. I think the exam is very reasonable. It's not as
difficult as the homework. I think there are no fantastic tricks you have to
think up in the last minute. I would say go over the exam once and find the
friendly problems and do them first. Then when you're warmed up, do the
others. Yeah?</p>

I don't think--somebody asked me that. I dug them up from some stuff. I don't
know where the solutions are, and the TAs are already overloaded, so sorry.</p>
